    <p>The right honourable gentleman will have read the submission by the Australian Council of Social Service - the acknowledged professional body - that the inquiry should be held into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and not confined to poverty and should be held by persons with skills and knowledge from Commonwealth, State, local government and voluntary agency fields though not acting as representatives, experts in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and user and citizen members and that the issues are too complex and the skills required too diverse for one man or woman alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, what consistently worries us is that in many areas there is a clear need as a matter of very high priority for this and other forms of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which, for a number of social, cultural and economic reasons do not get developed; that is, the initiatives regrettably are not taken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 just want to point out to the House and to the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  that members of the armed services stationed at Butterworth near Penang have mentioned to me lately that they feel that their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> could be improved considerably if on humanitarian grounds the Government were to organise periodic charter flights so that the relations of those people who are up there for a long term could visit the serving personnel in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 10 (1) of the States Grants (Home Care) Act provides that where a person is employed as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer of a senior citizens’ centre wholly or mainly in connexion with the provision of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services by or in association with the centre there is payable to the State, by way of financial assistance, an amount equal to one half of the amount paid to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer by way of salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, as the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech, it is proposed to amend this Act soon to increase the rate of the Australian Government’s subsidy to two-thirds of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer who devotes 75 per cent or more of his time to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for the aged is accepted as being ‘wholly’ so employed and half of his salary is paid by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment of this assistance is usually claimed by the State concerned at quarterly intervals based on records kept by the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer in the course of his work with the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A detailed report, to provide a basis for assessment of th subsidy payable, is necessary only in those cases where the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer devotes between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of his time to aged people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have to inform the Committee that we have present in the gallery this evening members of the Swedish Parliament’s Standing Committee on Social Affairs (<span class="highlight">Welfare</span>) led by  Mr Goran  Karlsson,  Chairman  of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that we have to look to the real <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these Aboriginal people - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gave the justification for that in the following words: ‘It would be self-defeating if the system of wage indexation were to attempt to insulate the community from tax measures designed to redistribute resources for the benefit of the community in the form of improved public facilities in fields such as education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, personal benefits, urban improvement and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-53-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ‘this House congratulates the Government on its continuing action to restrict inflation and its effects on people with low incomes receiving superannuation or receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and condemns the Opposition for placing in jeopardy the improvement in living standards of all Australians since 2 December 1972 by its action to defer the passage of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time the Government took the opportunity to say to the Premiers that the position in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is very much derivative from the stop-go policies which were pursued by the previous Labor Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that members of the Australian Labor Party claim that they are the only ones who have an option on a social conscience; that they are the only ones who would make a contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our community and the way we live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This followed growing concern by people working in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies, and local community groups, that many elderly people were either being forced to live in squalid conditions or placed in Nursing Homes because of the lack of flexibility in the types of services being offered to the residents of the Inner city area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know it is unusual for members of this House to speak in the third reading stage of a Bill, but I want to express my pleasure at the fact that the Bill has reached this stage and that shortly there will be an increase in the amount of the nation’s wealth which is expended on caring for those in need of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat to all Australians, but particularly to the Western Australians in whose State there has been a determined effort to confuse and frighten, that the Commonwealth has no aim other than to ensure that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is provided for all those who need it, and as well that all Australians, regardless of means, should have a real chance of owning their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And now, as we enter this new decade of opportunity for Australia, I leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties in the faith that Divine Providence will guide your deliberations and further the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I am sure that this and other matters concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of primary producers of this country were very carefully considered by the Minister for Primary Industry and indeed by the Government generally since there are, as the honourable member would agree, many advantages enjoyed by primary producers which the other sections of the community do not enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Labor Party said that it was going to spend half that amount of money in improvements in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, perhaps by eliminating university fees - I think the figure we recommended was only about $12m - the Government would express alarm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received complaints, and from inquiries I have made it seems that at least some of these organisations are primarily concerned with encouraging people to invest funds in their various business enterprises rather than with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the individuals involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly it is designed to achieve a political aim and not to contribute to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  claims to support, namely the professional engineers of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a contribution towards the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of certain people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grave deficiency as I see it is that the provision of the Meals on Wheels service, like so many other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits required in the community, is dependent on the response of charitable groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some areas of need will receive a benefit because the people in those areas are concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we intend to develop social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, we should identify priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are living in an age where human values are supposed to be predominant and clearly it is quite wrong to approach the provision of Meals on Wheels services or other community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services on this ad hoc basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is clearly needed is a regional organisation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a grave deficiency in our approach to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community if we always approach these things on an ad hoc basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all we know it might very well be that other forms of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service rate  a  much higher priority than Meals on Wheels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  make it only to indicate that we are wrong in plucking something out of the air as  a  social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service because we think This will be very good for votes at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we need in the Australian community is some sort of inquiry to establish what are our needs in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later I shall outline the multitudinous problems that a society such as ours creates when its elderly citizens, both superannuitants and pensioners, after a lifetime of contributing to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and prosperity of Australia, are given a small1 pittance to eke out a subsistence living and are then forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is a measure of the Government’s inability to get to grips wtih the problems of aged people that we now see another few small attempts to patch up the present creaking social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There would have been no need for the receipts tax if the national Government had accepted at least as much responsibility for civic finances and functions - in land acquirement, in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, in culture, in transport, in pollution - as national governments in any comparable country, in either federal or unitary systems, already do and have done for decades past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not one aspect of the many sided task we have to do in New Guinea - in defence, in development, in commerce, in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, in education - in which the value of the Australian contribution will not be enhanced when we cease also to be rulers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are also being forced on local government by subsidy in the way of baby health centres, elderly citizens’ clubs, creches and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say that I deprecate the possibility that there will be stoppages of this magnitude - with their obvious harm to Australian industry, commerce and the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people - while claims are before the national conference, which has the support of all parties including the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no use asking the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers: ‘What have you done to assimilate the Aboriginals today?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental question today is not whether the District Commissioner was on leave: it is the miserable effort by honourable members opposite to use a public servant in Papua and New Guinea in order to foist something on this Parliament - to drag the issue of Papua and New Guinea down to this single incident instead of allowing us to discuss matters affecting the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You are assembled at this Second Session of the 27lh Parliament to consider and decide on matters affecting the security and growth of the Australian nation, and matters concerning the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the citizens who constitute that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly 3 years have elapsed since the Government was given the responsibility for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and still no accurate figures are available about almost any area that requires concentrated attention - health, education or housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improvement involved in the amendments is only minuscule in comparison with the needs for major overhaul in social service and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is especially so if the structure of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme is to penetrate into the heart of what is called the poverty environment and overcome want and deficiency, and to help people to lift themselves up and participate at a level in the economy which will give them self respect and adequacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rigidity of the present system of social services and the discontinuities in the various forms of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities available only consolidate people in the area of poverty and in the marginal area near that threshold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For anyone with a sense of moral commitment for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of one’s fellow beings in the community who are in an area of want, we have what should be an intolerable situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just as well for the physical and mental <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Minister that I proceed beyond these notes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leaves only $3.09 a week for food, clothing and travel, including travel to the nursing home, because obviously one spouse, who is not committed to an institution, will want to visit his or her mate to see how that mate is proceeding and how that mate’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 1 child in 13 in Australia is able to attend a child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centre which is up to government standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Opposition would have given wholehearted support to the Government if it had broadened out the debate by proposing to restructure completely the pattern of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provided under the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is in the situation where she is not only devoid of financial support from her husband but is having to contribute financially to his <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it could be the most significant legislation under the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> heading which the Parliament is to deal with in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Speech was silent on very important matters affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged people in our community and, indeed, invalids as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in this legislation is the time honoured connotation of the dollar complex and the inevitable and mercenary relationship of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation to a forthcoming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, the Government should recast Australia’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions to lay a basis for the remaining years of the 20th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Italy now leads us by roughly 30% in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States, with due respect to it, was one of the few countries, until the Kennedys came to light which never thought much of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, heads Australia by 12% at 66.6%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a damning indictment of the Government’s policy - the slip in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country after 20 years of administration by it is shown by the fact that we have dropped behind countries that never thought of having a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme in days gone by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why today I condemn to some extent the Minister for his failure to see that we lead other countries, as we did when Labor was in office, in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that the needy and the deserving get the assistance to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I think we have an obligation to pensioners from one end of this country to the other to get up and condemn the Government that spends unlimited funds on everything one can think of except social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to continue that straight path into the future, bearing in mind our responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the function of the Commonwealth should be to formulate national policy and what might be termed ‘social and economic priorities’ such as how education will be used as an instrument of social and economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is an appointed spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on health matters but I would like to draw his attention as a fell’ow Queenslander and somebody who I would like to believe is interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of my State to a statement made by his leader during the last election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will be aware that in my policy speech I said that the government would continue to make general improvements in the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> field as and when we can responsibly do so, without causing inflation or increasing the tax burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under present arrangements child <span class="highlight">welfare</span>,, broadly speaking, is a function pf the States rather than of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes the Commonwealth into a new area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work but its purpose is to enable churches and voluntary organisations to improve and expand a service which they have been providing for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, it was not so long ago that the Minister for Social Services - [ would pray that he would correct me if I am wrong - endeavoured to prevail upon Cabinet and the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  to increase social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government that sits in this place, and which is supposed to look after the aged and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community, had to wait almost 20 years before it recognised that these organisations were doing a very good job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does seem though, as honourable members from this side have pointed out, that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  with all his great talk about social justice and what he would do for the people of Australia, has proved that he is a bits and pieces and patch up man in respect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is very critical of members of the Opposition when we talk of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This real social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme was pioneered by people from this side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is, as the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  said, that this Government has never made a survey of what is required in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in respect of Meals on Wheels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the Minister will not admit that, instead of accepting his responsibility under the Constitution for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the aged, he is passing the buck onto voluntary institutions from one end of this country to the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is always boasting about what has been done by this Government in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another factor which should be considered in relation to this Bill is this: Why does not the Government subsidise meals which are served in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres conducted by various councils throughout the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all is said and done, these meals are being served to the aged in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commendable as it is to subsidise even in the minimum way that the Government has done in respect of those people who will be served meals in their own homes, these organisations that conduct these services to which people come, such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres, also should be entitled to the benefits of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the best contribution that the present Minister for Social Services can make to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged people it is a long, long way to that haven of security that they have all longed for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that members on the Government side will be as extravagant with money for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes as they are in other fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might have come, to expect from this Government by now that when it brings down social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation of this kind it would present to the Parliament some kind of social survey of the community indicating the basis - of need, where it is located and what kind of methods are going to be used to meet the need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have imagined that in a piece of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation of this kind we would have been setting out in some way to remedy the deficiencies, or the most obvious deficiencies, that exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> workers attached to Meals on Wheels services in my own area have indicated to me that they would be strongly in support of the provision of meals at such centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who are involved in this business of providing Meals on Wheels, particularly <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers who are employed by such services, feel that a lot more should be done to advertise the existence of Meals on Wheels services, not only to attract good civic minded people to come and help in the provision of such meals but also to bring this service to the notice of a great many more people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made to me also by these liaison officers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers that provision ought to be made for a good deal more communication and discussion between <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and the like from different areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was called the Old Peoples <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers do not feel that this is sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the extent of this service apparently will build up, they believe that there ought to be more opportunity for discussion and liaison between <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers so that they might get ideas about how each of them runs his or her service, how the services are financed and how volunteers are attracted to carry out the work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just recently the honourable members for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham),  Bendigo  (Mr Kennedy)  and myself, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee, went to Newcastle to have a look at the scheme operating there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated before that the Government had gone off half-cocked on many of these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth offered a 50% subsidy for services that cared for people in their own homes, a subsidy towards the building and extension of senior citizens centres, provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to be employed at such centres, the provision of para-medical services for old people, such as chiropody services, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to try to assess how far the basic services of Meals on Wheels, pensions, housing, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are specifically designed and effectively directed towards meeting the needs of old people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the priority of these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> steps? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are adequate and, indeed, how many are grossly inadequate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada had a Senate select committee looking into the problems of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The local council, with an enlightened outlook on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, was already providing home help services and many other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the finance for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services was already overstrained and the council had to look for a local charitable organisation to raise the money that was needed to meet the capital cost of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In supporting the legislation that is now before the House, 1 would like to congratulate the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  for introducing another social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has emphasised that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is not merely the handing of services to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must do this with the knowledge that our own <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and security are inextricably bound up with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and security of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a comprehensive survey of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of our nation we do not know, to the extent that we should know, just what other services such an organisation should be giving to the elderly people of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was my privilege to meet Miss Taylor when we were both appointed as the first members of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Advisory Council in South Australia which was set up under the Labor Government’s new Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Act in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that it was with Miss Doris Taylor on the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Advisory Council in South Australia that I first came across the great need for a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find, if I might use the term, the Gorton problem that whenever some <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme is brought forward it comes unstuck because the States will not ratify the legislation because they do not acquire the finance to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What worries me is that, as with so many other aspects of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy brought into this Parliament, no comprehensive report has been produced to the Parliament indicating the basis upon which the Government has made its decision to embark on particular legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not talking of the general public relations booklet which the Department has produced but the sort of report that is produced as a command paper by the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grandiloquence of the Minister on this aspect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scarcely seems justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report did not stand up technically nor did it cater for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of South Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second basic reason was the obvious difference in approach, attitude and capabilities - and here I am making a contrast between Liberal Premiers,  Sir Thomas  Playford and Steele Hall in keeping the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their State constantly to the forefront. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of South Australia were interested in the issues concerning their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On looking at the map of New South Wales it can be seen that the Menindee Lakes are the only major water storage in the western part of New South Wales and to hand over control of this water to the River Murray Commission, as stated in the terms of this Bill, is a serious disregard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the citizens of this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was urged to be brief but I want to close by making a considered statement and I do so as one whose only interest in this exercise is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is most frustrating, indeed quite horrifying, to a new member to come here full of the wonderful spirit of being able to make some contribution to this national Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people but to see the appalling tactics adopted time and time again by the Government to prevent members from making some contribution, however small it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time the new health benefits plan will retain the basic principles which the Government believes are essential in any national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also one would never contest the case that there was a special obligation on members of Parliament, whatever their Party, and on any other members of those parties to protest in a way which is most likely to conduce to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undesirable is defined as any publication that ‘brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt; is harmful to the relations between any sections of the Republic; is prejudicial to the safety of the State, the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or the peace and good order’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the State Grants (Home Care) Act it would be acceptable for a local governing authority to employ a social worker or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer in connection with approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for aged people within its area and to seek the Commonwealth grant of half the amount of the person’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should have such a provision for 2 reasons: In the first place, tax avoidance would result in a loss of dutv to the revenue, which is important enough in itself; but secondly, and of interest to everyone interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those in rural areas, as we all ought to be, it would create a more artificial demand for rural land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most recent available document which surveys the types of social security schemes operating overseas is the United States Department of Health, Education and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>’s publication ‘Social Security Programmes Throughout the World 1967’, which gives the principal features of schemes inthe following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Ceylon, Chad, Chile, China (Nationalist), China (Communist), Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany (Federal Republic), Germany (East), Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Korea (South), Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Arab Republic, United Kingdom, United States of America, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam (South), Vietnam (North), Yugoslavia, Zambia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The complexity and diversity of the schemes operating in the countries surveyed by the United States Department of Health, Education and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> are such that it is not possible to provide a concise and accurate summary, and hence the publication mentioned above is recommended to the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that that was a most important contribution to Australia’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In America the former Secretary of Housing, Education and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and now head of the Urban Coalition, John W. Gardner, has bluntly stated that the present system of medical care delivery is outworn, expensive and outrageously inefficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third principle is that the national expenditure on health must rema n in balance with our expenditure in other areas such as education, national development and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general practitioner has a tremendously important part to play not only in relation to the physical <span class="highlight">welfare</span> but also the psychological <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I accept that as I assume we all do as social justice which has motivated not only modern social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> states but many other earlier and even ancient societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the general practitioner groups who have criticised the scheme and have offered alternatives have done so honourably and with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the public and the type of medical service available to the public as their prime motivation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Statistician has advised that he is examining the practicability of obtaining separate classifications of ‘certified nurses’, ‘probationers or trainees’ and ‘nursing personnel not elsewhere classified’, for purposes of both the next Census and the annual returns from health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I believe that the medical profession is entitled to consideration in the formation of a new health scheme, it seems to me that it is one thing to afford consideration but that it is another thing to go overboard and to bc led by the nose to such an extent that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community of this country has to take second place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps a more equitable approach is to finance health services from taxation just as we finance education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and most other public services in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is concerned not simply with financing a health scheme but with ensuring that there is quality in medical care and regard for the patient’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far 1 have been speaking about the patient with whose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> the Government states it is primarily concerned as a taxpayer, but the patient is also a contributor to insurance and as such he must pay an additional $24m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state this is a process of robbing Peter to pay Paul, then it is the Peters to whom I am referring, and it is the Pauls on behalf of whom my friend, the honourable member for Barton, is complaining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After listening to the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr Graham)  I could not but think that if he represents the advanced thinking of members of the Government side on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes it is no wonder that the national health scheme is in a hell of a mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average working class man who arrives in Australia with his family is struck by the inordinate costs of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia both in the field of education and in the field of health, lt would pay honourable members to make a study of the advantages and disadvantages of the British medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, the Parliament has justification for hoping that these wielders of the scalpel would also have incisive minds, that they would be men able to cut quickly to the core of concern in this debate, namely, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would probably soon reach the position that is applying in Canada, where the Minister for National Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> has announced that reductions of 25% in votes for both emergency health services and emergency <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services will be effected in 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In these teams would be people whose principal job was to evaluate development proposals and compare alternatives and give the Government the facts about the alternatives so that the Government could make up its mind which was the best proposition in which to invest funds on behalf of the people of Australia and in the best interests of Australia, taking into account of course the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia and the commercial principles involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Ministers of his Government, especially the Minister for External Affairs, have been enunciating passionate concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and rights of people in other countries, will he extend this with some consistency by now publicly condemning and denouncing the treatment of these political prisoners in Greece? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable member for Banks  (Mr Martin)  that public servants have kept pace with the rise in national productivity, but the benefits of increased productivity can be and are distributed in many other ways - in higher wages, the avoidance of price increases that might otherwise occur, and increased expenditure on community services such as education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>for instance, a cardiac problem, and some apprehension exists about his <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, he would go into hospital for that sort of treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first thing he referred  to  was a 25% cut in the votes for emergency health and emergency <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which were effective during this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am certain that all members of the Parliament sympathise with and support the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  about the need to look after and protect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have honourable members opposite ever stopped to think of the needs of most people in our community, to consider what could have been provided for them with the money which has been wasted on the Fill aircraft, how many schools could have been built, how many pre-schools might have been constructed or what burden could have been lifted from the pensioners, to refer to one narrow field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he were to appreciate that in the view, of the Opposition in this Parliament there is no substantial threat to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, survival and development of Australia it might be easier for him to understand Labor’s position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently in this House I have raised by way of questions and in debate the very extreme plight that age and invalid pensioners find themselves in as a result of the callous attitude displayed by the Liberal-Country Party Government towards those members of the community who are reliant upon social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Added to the number receiving social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are those in the community who are in receipt of some form of fixed income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by stating that the Government is discriminating against most of the people by ignoring their needs, their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, their protection, their health and their security and imposing at the same time a taxation burden from which the country gets scant and reluctant government benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir, it  is quite clear from the remarks of all of them that they arc concerned with preserving the special position which the lending institutions now enjoy in this country and with preserving the special position enjoyed by the interests which show little regard for Australia’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the Government’s view - a government that proclaims an interest for people and their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - then its policy and approach to the problems of the people that I have talked about this morning are bankrupt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members in this Parliament have been entrusted to look after the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The team manager thought that it was a shocking thing to happen in a civilised country but was forced to warn  Dr Darveniza  for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the team as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anything, one thing above all that can be said of the Labor Party,  Sir Thomas  Playford and the Independent  Speaker  in South Australia is that they have been consistent in trying to safeguard the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of South Australia by insisting on the Chowilla dam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But railways are built for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, progress and development of a State and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the next Senate election, and at the House of Representatives elections, I shall propose joint standing committees - for example, on Aboriginals, science and technology, health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and technical change as my Party’s platform ordains, and, as I have often advocated, on such matters as law reform, Commonwealth-State agreements and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In March he suggested committees on external affairs and defence; transport and communications; trade, industry and labour; legal, constitutional and home affairs; health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and science; and national finance and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work of this Committee pointed the way for advances in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Adverting to the point with which I commenced and which I want to develop, this again is social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by instalments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs and priorities of the community have not been established and indeed are being ignored because of this piecemeal way in which the Government approaches social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arises because the philosophy upon which the Government largely bases its action in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> seems to be vote purchasing power which is cynically calculated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of cynical standard ought to be rejected, and we ought to have identified and clearly established the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities and needs of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where are the white papers on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are extremely valuable because they create an informed mind and help to develop a suitable climate for more positive reception of proposed changes in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I did quite a bit of reading in the public library in Brisbane, and one of the most influential documents I read was a report on this subject by the British Ministry of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the secrecy which shrouds so much of what is done by Government departments which are noi associated with strategic factors, such as defence - health cannot be put into this category, nor can social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - and given the fact that when the Government does make an inquiry it keeps its information confidential, it is awfully difficult for ordinary members of Parliament - back benchers on the Government side, and front and back benchers on this side - to delve out the sort of information they need if they are to make valid conclusions on important matters of legislation in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This just is not good enough and ii is nol the way in which we ought to be proceeding in our deliberations on important social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot expect that he alone will change the situation in relation to resources for private members, but he can do something about seeing that reports are produced regularly on aspects of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy or on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is sometimes said of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that it is not a question of policy but of politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the view of two overseas experts - not people with a political axe to grind if that is the way in which my approach might be interpreted, but people who, out of human compassion and because of their professional training, are concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the mentally retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Referring to education, I now want to quote from the 15th Annual Report of the Queensland Subnormal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that the measure of the human compassion which motivates the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy of the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives concern to those responsible for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is its disjointed and uneven approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes for handicapped children achieving? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland it is notorious that when the Federal Government provided age pensions for those people in mental institutions the State Government immediately moved in and charged those people rent and board for occupation of the premises and it did not divert the money released in this way into increased benefits, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services or activities in the mental, institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto, child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has always been regarded as the responsibility of the States and the voluntary organisations, although the Commonwealth has been paying $1.50 per day as a subsidy towards the accommodation of certain handicapped children who are living away from home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 11 such regional advisory committees in New South Wales consisting of representatives of education and public health bodies and child and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, to help guide and advise the New South Wales Government and local workers for the cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>School facilities will be acceptable only if the schools receive certification under the Public Instruction Act, while residential facilities for children or pre-school kindergarten facilities require to be licensed under the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Act of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>assistance from government and voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies -  nevertheless the spastic organisations throughout Australia, in the main, do not have enough income to adequately carry out their total responsibilities to the cerebral palsied, and this inadequacy lies mainly in the medical treatment/ medical training/nursing field- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my own State there is the Subnormal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Organisation and the Wheelchair and Disabled Association of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay a tribute to the Minister for Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and the Minister for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>,  Mr Hewitt,  who is a personal friend of mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the knowledge also that all Slates are screaming for more revenue from the Commonwealth Government to meet their commitments, local councils, voluntary organisations, parents organisations and the parents and families of these unfortunate people whose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not start because some grand idea was formulated within the Commonwealth Department of Social Services or a State Department of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that bothers me most is that nobody in Australia is settling down to look at the whole field of handicapped children, let alone the whole field of general <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and asking: ‘What are rights of the people that we should be looking after? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has made a survey of Australia’s needs in education and it should be able to do this in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and assistance to handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That child’s parents probably need a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should also be social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers available to be able to go around and visit families so as to assist the parents in educating handicapped children if the parents are undertaking this task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acting on a brochure we received from the Sub-Normal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association, we  inspected The Chalet, and were immediately taken with the ‘family’ type atmosphere, and the progressive outlook of the director . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we have reached the situation where the Government rarely accepts full responsibility with regard to any field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years governments have relaxed this policy slightly by giving such groups a ‘modest subsidy, but without ever being prepared to accept responsibility for the organising, financing and running of the whole range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In England rand other countries the government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies are constantly under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past 25 years there has been only one major review of any social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this and because child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is something which requires more individual application than the granting of the adult invalid pension it is reasonable to consider that this is primarily a State function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) It is generally accepted by pensioners and all concerned with their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that a surviving spouse needs more than half the pension income available to a married pensioner couple to maintain an equal living standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Collectively it is a very significant contributor to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation, lt is of great importance in earning export income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The welding together of a practical approach involving considerations of scientific advances which, these days, can make possible efficiency if there is an economic basis, together with considerations of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> give us the spectacle of an industry that concerns people; and people are the concern of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both economically and in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> terms then I think transferable quotas would be beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all our actions, therefore, the overall objective must be the healthy continuation of an industry capable of competing on world markets; an industry which has contributed, and will continue to contribute, provided sound and realistic policies are pursued, to the nation’s economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want also to congratulate the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry on showing the same courage in taking what were no doubt in some quarters - and this has been proved - unpopular decisions, but they were the right decisions for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian wheat grower and the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and future of the staff of the Authority are matters of the utmost importance, and that proper provision for any who might be displaced in whatever permanent arrangements are ultimately developed for the industry should be determined well in advance of any such displacement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister considered widening the scope of national service to include matters of civil defence such as natural disaster relief and a coastguard service which would at once constitute a constructive contribution to the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and obviate the protests of those who oppose national service as a means by which they can be involved in a particular war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The group was formed entirely on the initiative of the Tolais who composed it and, as they have said themselves, its only concern is the unity and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Tolai people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, modern societies require that a great deal of work hi the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field be carried out by local authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The intriguing feature about this is that the Leader of the most centralist Party in its own power distribution in the Anglo-Saxon world - except the Communist Party - would find the occasion appropriate to raise for discussion as a matter of public importance a subject concerning the fate, the existence and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of] local government and semigovernment authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he realise that vast population increase, once considered highly desirable, is now being questioned due to the pressures it places on education, health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, housing and land prices and the consequent diminution in the quality of life that over-crowded cities have on our environment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This clause of the Bill is merely further evidence of the Government’s determination to put the riches of our country at the mercy of foreign enterprise and comes as no surprise from the Liberal Party which sees any national effort, be it the Snowy Mountains Authority or the Australian Industry Development Corporation, as a threat to its friends who could not care less about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, whilst the provision of glasses does not happen to be a traditional medical service in the way in which one might view a surgical procedure, the need for glasses often can be more vital for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the patient than many other medical services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By these proposals the Government seeks: - to provide for a large increase in essential expenditures, especially on payments to the States, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, development and assistance to industry, including emergency relief for woolgrowers hard hit by drought and low prices; - to make reductions in personal income taxation, especially on lower and middle income earners, estimated to have a value to the taxpayers concerned of $289m in a full financial year and $228m in 1970-71; we thereby make good - indeed more than make good - our undertaking to give substantial income tax relief to this large body of people; - notwithstanding these large commitments, to produce a responsible budget, a balanced budget, a budget shaped to the requirements of an economy that is dynamic and fast-growing - but an economy still threatened by disruptive inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700818_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  who was very vocal in opposition to this item has a motion before the House seeking standing committees on foreign affairs and defence, finance and trade, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, primary industry and national development, transport and communications, education, science and the arts, legal, home and internal territory affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not mind being a sort of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Shops (to provide day-to-day needs); play areas, infant health and pre-school child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres; meeting hall; and schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the following divisions are suggested: A standing committee on foreign affairs and defence, a standing committee on finance and trade, a standing committee on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, a standing committee on primary industry and national development, a standing committee on transport and communications, a standing committee on education, science and the arts, and a standing committee on legal, home and internal territory affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It helps Liberals obscure the truth that government expenditure is, or should be and could be, the community’s own investment in its own prosperity and its own <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget highlights the impossibility, not to say the immorality, of clinging to the present system of sole reliance on cash payments to meet the requirements of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in a modern society - a society which claims to be enlightened and progressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this system those who depend on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments - the aged, the widows, the sick, the handicapped, the veterans - are not only the victims of Liberal economic policies; they become an instrument in that policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his first year of office we had from the Prime Minister what was to be a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the very way in which the taxation concessions have been administered in this Budget illustrates that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principle has been honoured by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very fact that a rate of taxation concession applies at a higher level for incomes up to $10,000, at a decreasing level to $20,000 and cuts out at  a  higher level of income, indicates a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those who say that having granted these taxation concessions not sufficient was given in other terms - in terms of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one makes no apologies for the taxation concessions because it follows <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principles, especially on the levels up to $10,000 a year, and then it follows good economic principles of providing incentives on incomes above that level of income a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax concessions followed some well worn and well recognised social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principles and I hope that they will be recognised for what they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who likes any lack of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this year indirect taxation has risen slightly so that some increases in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and some increases in terms of works could be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, never have recipients of social services been treated with such contempt and such callous disregard for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as they have in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on this occasion in particular the Government has shown complete disregard and complete contempt for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their commitments include the education of their children, looking after the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their families, paying off their homes and providing their families with what most Australians would consider to be the standard of living to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the honourable member forgotten this, but obviously he has not made a close study of the policy speeches of leaders of the Australian Labor Party who have from time to time during election campaigns - in  1953, 1954  and  1955  in particular - made enormous gestures towards a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia and matters which over the next 12 months the Government must consider carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his critical speech yesterday I would have expected the Leader of the Opposition to concede that in this Budget there was an enormous diversion of resources to the States and to assert that these were insufficient, which is the usual Opposition line of attack, or that too much money was being diverted to the States and that from the vast sums going to the States funds should be diverted for social services and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been contributing to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund in the form of taxation and they have been getting shrunken benefits in return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice tendered to me by these senior officers, who have had considerable experience in the handling of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cases, is that at this stage the facts do not justify the repatriation of that family at Commonwealth expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>000m per year in hidden costs, as the Minister said in his announcement, because they cannot be readily dissected from total community spending on facilities such as education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, provision of water, sewerage, roads, hospitals, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One need hardly add the present deficiencies that exist in the field of education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health, coupled with the spiralling cost of land and housing - and we have just had an example of how little is being done for people such as pensioners - to know that a continually increasing population has created a gap for many millions of Australians between the myth of the affluent society and the reality of the deficiencies they are facing in almost: every facet of their day to day existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding my remarks on the rural section I point out that the essential difference between the Government’s policy and the Opposition’s policy is that the Government endeavours to implement the policy of the primary producers expressed through their elected representatives, while the Opposition in a blatant vote catching exercise supports generally the dissentient minority without regard to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the industry and those engaged in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is a monumental failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the very words ‘social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’ are anathema to most members of the coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a reasonable assumption that he ought to be interested in farmers, their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and their future, although primary producers in my own State of Tasmania have formed other opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of primary industry has for too long been ignored by this Government and primary producers are to stage a protest march in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The business of this Parliament and the members of this Parliament is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To increase our understanding of the problems facing these people, a new section was recently created within my Department to carry out research into the effects of social, cultural and environmental factors on employment and employee <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been necessitated, no doubt - we have to face it - by the need to find additional funds to pay increased amounts to the States as general revenue and the need for further large sums to meet the bill for education, health services and national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is purely and solely a matter which concerns only the department responsible for education in each State and only the government of each Stale, or is it something which concerns the interests and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the whole of the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also condemns the Government for its lack of interest and apathy towards social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of past actions by the Liberal Government we could predict just how miserly and meagre the Government would be in its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is natural that I should take this interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view is that council government is one of the ideal areas in which an active role can be played in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been looking at the Budget estimates of expenditure this year and the amount that has already been spent in accordance with legislation introduced last year to provide Commonwealth participation in a comprehensive plan of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for the aged and infirm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a comparison of the amount to be spent next year on such things as paramedical services in the home, senior citizen centres and the provi sion of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers one will see that the Government has still really not gone very far beyond the old philosophy of putting aged people into institutions and keeping them there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interest of the Liberal Party is not primarily in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people: it is not primarily in the aim of providing the Government assistance to which we in the Australian Labor Party believe the people are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the Budget will reveal that 36% of the proposed expenditure will go to the States; 14% has been allocated to defence purposes; 23% to expenditure on national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and repatriation measures; and 2% to external aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I move on now to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such countries there is a considerable obligation of offspring to take some part in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure is to be increased by $148m and expenditure on capital works by $78m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At page 71 the Budget contains 48 categories of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a budget providing for a large increase in essential expenditures, especially on payments to the States, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, development and assistance to rural industry, including emergency relief for wool growers who have been hard hit by drought and low prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those plans are so significant that they affect the level of economic activity of the country and the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of each of its citizens, and thus the lives of each one of us who lives here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are capable of selection, but in the areas of resource allocation and the setting of appropriate social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities these budgetary policies have been remiss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 on page 13 of the Budget Speech documents, under the heading ‘Payment to National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund’, discloses a drop of $20,143,000 in the amount expected to be spent on child endowment during the current year - from an actual expenditure of $220,143,000 in 1969- 70 to an estimated $200m in 1970- 71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it quite plain that this meeting was a proper meeting, that it is proper for the people of the south coast - trade unionists and othersto be concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their old people and to be concerned also with the consequences of industrial accidents, and that if they wish to say something about the Budget at the same time then I am perfectly happy and willing to receive their proper representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter in which I hope that the real things to be considered - namely, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the old people on the south coast and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who may be the victims of industrial accidents - will not be made a political football, as would seem to have been the consequence of the published statement of  Mr Nixon  which he said was a misreport of what his words were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments will account for $ 1,820m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we see the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision amounting to almost that total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration should be given also to various other aspects of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tapered means test, supplementary assistance, homes for the aged, sheltered workshops and Meals on Wheels have resulted in increased expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that the two previous Budgets were social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budgets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  and others told us that they were social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budgets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> there can be some disappointment with what is provided by the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I take random headings from the Treasurer’s speech, I see: ‘Defence’, ‘Payments to the States’, Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>’, ‘Sheltered Workshops’, Repatriation Benefits’, ‘Mental Health Institutions’, ‘External Aid’, ‘Assistance to Woolgrowers’ and ‘Aboriginal Advancement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Australia led the world nearly 50 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, these industries are vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and interests of the Australian community, and more particularly those who live outside the metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding social services, I think that the House sometimes has been inclined to overlook that payments this year from our National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund will reach the all-time level of $ 1,473m, which is an increase of SI 31m over last year or an increase of almost 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except for 1969-70 this is the largest increase in the whole history of the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behind this increase in expenditure from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund there are several factors, and I should like to list three of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would suggest that the House might consider that one reason for this is that in this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field 1970-71 is the year of health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item which possibly has been discussed more than any other in this debate is social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this Budget is SI, 820m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 items I have mentioned, payments to the States, defence and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, represent about 72 per cent of total expenditure for this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allocation represents almost a quarter of the estimated expenditure for this financial year, lt is a pretty fair figure for any nation to be allocating to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health benefits and other items within the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field also give them security and this is what they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present conditions influence not only thos: people on fixed incomes, such as recipients of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments about whom I have been speaking, but also industries which earn their returns from exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field the Government is accused of denying benefits to the aged, the sick and the handicapped, to prevent inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this and schemes such as the home care programme, the aged persons homes scheme, the sheltered employment scheme and the Commonwealth rehabilitation scheme are taken into account it is clear that the Government is most concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the less fortunate members of our community and has taken effective action to improve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the instrument for carrying out the Government’s policies in the fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and education, defence, the development of the nation’s resources and other essential areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the increases in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments will be welcomed, a 50c increase to pensioners will not arouse any degree of enthusiasm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means test as we know it would, ipso facto, disappear and a very limited <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund would exist for cases for dire emergency where a new and much more stringent means test would apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst one is critical of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspect of the Budget in particular, it is more important to see the way that the Leader of the Opposition has approached the economy as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As usual, the Opposition could well be asked how it would finance its vast but indefinite expenditure on defence, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, local government, education and overseas aid, without increasing taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why then, for the sake of politics, does the ALP support those who are not interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sure, this year our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme concentrates on consolidating past gains and getting the new health scheme under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the tremendously important field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> the Leader of the Opposition again came forward -with a most confused dissertation that I could not understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>would like to see certain other improvements in the social service and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation, particularly for old people, but this is my personal opinion and it is not backed, as it should be, by the information that is available to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me now mention briefly some of the achievements in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total expenditures on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the Northern Territory have risen from S6.7m in 1965-66 to an estimated SI 5.7m in 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber, those few who bothered to speak in this debate - and they were extremely rare - attacked the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures in the Budget quite outspokenly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at what the Government promised when it came to office, particularly in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government will review the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> with the object of assisting those in most need while at the same time not discouraging thrift, self-help and self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 21st March the honourable member for Evans made a speech on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was involved in 2 meetings of the Public Works Committee, a meeting of the Publications Committee, a meeting of my Party’s Aboriginal Affairs Committee and a short time ago a meeting of my Party’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee was scheduled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory the administration of education by the Commonwealth is shared by the Departments of Education and Science and the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch of the Northern Territory Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  foreshadowed this in his policy speech before the last elections when he laid it down that rehabilitation would be one of our major objectives in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subjects of these committees will be foreign affairs and defence; finance and trade; health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; primary industry and national development; transport and communications; education, science and arts; and legal, home and internal territory affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if a Government member were worth his salt, knowing what was proposed for pensioners in the Budget, and he had any sort of fortitude at all he would have stood his ground firmly, as the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  who is not in the chamber tonight, should have done on the matter of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was payments to or for the States, the second was <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the third was development and the fourth was assistance to industry and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next section worthy of mention is that of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, many honourable members on this side of the Committee and on the other side have a great deal to say about the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> section of the Budget Papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the increase in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field is an additional $131m over the figures of 1969-70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in the 2 areas that I have mentioned - Commonwealth payments to or for the States and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> section - there has been a grand total of increase of expenditure over the last year of $422m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the effects of the scheme on the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would recognise, although I do not agree with the Australian presence in South Vietnam, that our forces over there have carried out their duties in the best traditions of the Australian armed forces and I believe very sincerely that they have endeavoured to make a contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those people in the province for which they have had a measure of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will recall that in Townsville we have formed a sporting association for Aboriginals known as the All Blacks <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Sporting Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heartily wish that the Minister for Social Services had contributed more of his time to this particular matter, because social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country is still blighted by concepts which were first conceived in the dying stages of the last century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been more appropriate for him to have talked in terms of new concepts that he hoped to develop in the last third of the 20th century in preparation for the new social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme which would be required to meet the needs of the people in the 21st century, which is a mere 30 years away, not long in the span of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the table that the Minister has presented to the House and which has been incorporated in Hansard, running to about 20 pages, he clearly has provoked this sort of response, so I will spend a few minutes discussing some aspects of how he could have looked at the pension in real terms of contributing to the people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is literally a level of deprivation for so many social service beneficiaries, for which this Government is responsible by manipulating pensions at election time in an effort to bribe votes and then neglecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of beneficiaries at crucial moments subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any money which becomes available for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be allocated to the area of greatest need and according to priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their need is greater than mine and social justice demands that greatest benefit from social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes must go to areas of greatest need as a priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not know what the long term objectives are for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unconcern for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which is consistently manifested in subsequent Budgets is an example of atrocious neglect of public responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an infinite variety of figures, analyses, surveys and findings to establish that the Australian system of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is inferior to need and that it stands embarrassingly disadvantaged compared to other advanced economies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where once we led in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services we now rank somewhere between 15th and 20th on a scale of what has been provided by various other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the 1968 United Nations Year Book on National Accounts, Australia spent 10.4 per cent of its gross national product on the provision of health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes in Australia proceed on a disjointed piecemeal basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is crass political opportunism which motivates a government to manipulate social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes like a box of tricks for election audiences to ‘ooh’ and aah’ over and then, after the election is over, to tuck the box away with determination after carefully labelling it: ‘Not to be used until the next election’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservative government at Canberra is thoroughly discreditable, exploiting as it does in this manner of grand political opportunism the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of those in want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A completely new approach must be adopted to the provision of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With these requirements in mind, the Australian Labor Party has pledged itself to undertake a wide ranging social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, not only aimed at rooting out poverty but also aimed at progressively removing the very real disadvantages of social discrimination and at establishing economic security for all in ill health, unemployment, invalidity, widowhood and age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the development of community based field services operated by regional departments of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will be fostered by direct special grants under section 96 of the Constitution to State governments, local authorities and voluntary agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the large allocation from the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund to health this financial year that more has not been available to keep up the pace of improvement in the pension rate which this Government has maintained since it came into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payments this year from our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund will reach an all time high of $ 1,473m, which is an increase of $13.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government will review the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, with the object of assisting those in dire need while at the same time not discouraging thrift, self help and self reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end my Government will set up  a  standing Cabinet committee, including the Ministers for Health, Social Services, Repatriation and Housing, and that Committee will direct its attention to coordinating the approaches and proposals qf the various departments concerned with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I summarise my remarks by emphasising that the Government stands condemned for its callous disregard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the pensioners and for its insulting and disgusting increase of 50c a week in pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been contributing to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund in the form of taxation and getting shrunken benefits in return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  not only because I believe in the amendment fervently but because I happen to represent an electorate which has more people who are concerned with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than any other electorate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that both sides of this House ought to try to stop scoring political points on the question of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote again from ‘Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in Canada 1969*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It extends federal sharing to include the following costs, which were not shared under the Unemployment Assistance Act: The cost of assistance to needy mothers with dependent children, maintenance of children in the care of provincially approved child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies, health care services to needy persons, and the extension of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to prevent or remove causes of  dependency or to assist recipients in achieving self-support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> services may include rehabilitation services; casework; counselling and assessment services; adoption services and homemaker, day-care and similar services supplied to persons in need or  to  persons to whom the service is essential if they are to remain selfsupporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our objective is a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure which identifies the most needy in the community and ensures that those who have no other means are provided with enough to live on, in  a  modest self-respecting way, without requiring any other assistance outside the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say that they involve very often the services of the Commonwealth, State Services, local government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, and those of private agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But their functions are limited and they operate independently of State social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies and other groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, of course, there ought to be in the regional council of social service structure provision for a contingency <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund which would be operated on a regional basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With every regional council of social services, in which the organisations and the State and Commonwealth services are integrated, with the advisory or administrative group and the contingency <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund that could be invoked in times of emergency, there ought to be also a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services directory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modern <span class="highlight">welfare</span> theory is based on the belief that problems do not come singly but in clusters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I put it to the Minister that on the basis of three very learned papers presented at the Australian Council of Social Services Conference in Canberra in May of this year, at which both the Minister and I were present, there seems to be very considerable scope for a thorough examination of this new theory about social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committees should bc serviced by high grade units skilled in social analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He contended that we needed a government White Paper on development of local health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is all said and done, this is a country which once showed initiative in leading the world in relation to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that most States now give some assistance in the form of State social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise that money is also spent in the field of repatriation and that the total amount of expenditure in the category of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is in the vicinity of $l,800m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are mindful of the fact, for instance, that child endowment, maternity allowances, child allowances, wife’s allowances and certain other benefits are very important and necessary for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and reasonable living standard of a large number of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill promised home care services for pensioners; capital subsidies for senior citizens centres; the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers in senior citizens centres; the provision of paramedical services by way of chiropody, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I believe the Minister should adopt the policy of the Labor Party and make <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits available to all Australians and eliminate the system whereby a person more than a century old is ineligible for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits which, putting it mildly, hardly assists our drive for migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, so far as the Department of Immigration is concerned, I believe that its officers should be congratulated if this migrant is the type of citizen selected - healthy, ageless and so confident that he will live long enough to share in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state of liberalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the matter that relates to the size of aid projects and their nature, which in the case of voluntary agencies are sometimes small and of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> nature rather than a developmental nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the plain fact is that if the Government wants those who have the responsibility of governing the RSL in every State and at the Federal level to become less interested in the matters that affect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of exservicemen obviously it has to distract the attention from the paucity of the Government’s attitude to the payment of compensation to those who have served this country in 2 world wars and in Korea and who are now serving Australia in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a completely unwarranted procedure in terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This imposes unwarranted demands on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and resources of these devoted organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment merely supports the contention of those who have responsibility to attend to matters affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of servicemen of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I urge the Minister and the Government to have another look at this because these services make a very worthwhile contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>action  of  those people and their disregard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These concession rates represent, in effect,  a  substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations to social and recreational clubs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The modern laissez faire economy - that is monetary and fiscal policy, wage freeze and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state - cannot get the allocation of resources needed for a great national effort or for any other purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, firstly, to accelerate progress towards economic self-reliance; secondly, to accelerate indigenous involvement, that is, involvement by local or native people, in employment, management and ownership; and thirdly, to raise the standards of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the local people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When in Canada a few weeks ago 1 checked on this claim with top officials of the Canadian Department of National Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it forgets entirely that having taken this H per cent it will have to take an enormous sum out of revenue to build up the deficiency in the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> account if that is all it is to be credited with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Leader of the Opposition saves only 1 life by his actions, he will have made a magnificent contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am hoping that we will be able to present evidence of his work before the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The estimated expenditure from the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund for this year is $423m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it arises in such a vital area of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> a number of competing interests come into play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an unusual government instrumentality because it handles such diverse matters as local transport, garbage, housing, kerbing and guttering, nature paths, adoption of children, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, agricultural services, animal and bird protection, architects’ registration, boiler inspection, bush fire control, the Canberra Tourist Bureau, registration of dogs, civil defence, drivers’ licences, electoral offices, forest management, fruit inspection, registration of hawkers, lake administration, meteorology, testing and registration of motor vehicles, the News and Information Bureau, the police, scaffolding and lifts, street cleaning, the War Memorial, weights and measures, and workers compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly,  1  should like to thank the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Nixon), Mr Giese  and the officers of the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch in all the places that we visited for their co-operation in making a fairly short visit to the Northern Territory as informative and educational as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to devote the rest of my time tonight to speaking about the situation at Wattie Creek near the Wave Hill <span class="highlight">welfare</span> settlement where a group of Aboriginals have been living for several years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August  1966  there was a strike, for award wages, on many pastoral stations in the Northern Territory and at that time a group of Aboriginal people - most of them were Gurindjis - went to camp near the Wave Hill <span class="highlight">welfare</span> settlement and later to their present site at Wattie Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The annual report of the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch of the Northern Territory for  1968-69  makes this comment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch ascribes motives with which I do not agree, it agrees that the Aboriginals at Wattie Creek have a strong attachment to the land in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems throughout all of these situations is that the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch of the Northern Territory Administration, the State Department of Aboriginal Affairs, or whoever the administration might be, always knows best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not without its disadvantages as well and I will quote from the report of the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch for 1967-68 in which it said about Wave Hill: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wave Hill <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Centre is situated 280 miles south west of Katherine, near the Wave Hill Police Station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the reason that they choose to live at Wattie Creek is that they desire to be independent from the cattle properties, particularly Vestey’s, and the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch for part of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch - for assistance in recruiting Aboriginal labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the following year in the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch report we find the comment that the labour demand was strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and integration of all its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in his publication ‘Immigration in the Seventies’ quoted interesting figures on the migrant contribution to our economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which should be studied by all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So apart from my concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and well being of all these people, the problems of the migrant community are now of special significance to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that a proper immigration programme must have a basis of and work towards ensuring Australia’s national and economic security, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and integration of all its citizens and the balanced development of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chain migration enables the base families to act as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Department of Immigration is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of migrants in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The council in that area has done more in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> at the grass roots level than the State and Federal governments put together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) Neither ibe Department’s staff of 15 social workers nor the 25 social workers employed with community agencies engaged in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work amongst migrants (whose salaries are financed by the Commonwealth) include a Finnish speaking social worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, many of the integration problems encountered by migrants do not require the services of professionally qualified social workers, but can be handled effectively by trained <span class="highlight">welfare</span> staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also endeavouring to increase its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> staff for which bilingual officers can more readily be recruited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recklessly disregards that matter, uncaring as to the outcome of it both for our own commitment or for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the South Vietnamese people and their capacity to choose their own solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth Government grants to autonomous health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations in Australia for capital purposes totalled $14m in 1969-70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What requests or suggestions were made by the Ministers concerned with child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> at their meeting in March 1970 for legislative or administrative action by (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the Territories and (c) the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-38-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advocate that we should have an Australian taxation foundation such as already exists in Canada, a body of people outside our Taxation Branch who are knowledgeable in this field - lawyers, accountants and people in business - and who are interested in this field which is vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our nation and vital to our level of economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the House to the Institute of Economic and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> which has been set up in the United Kingdom and subsidised by that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer shows - the figures are in the Budget - that in 1969-70 a lesser proportion of gross national expenditure was devoted to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments than was the case in 1960-61. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something which is rather contradictory and which has been built into the income tax structure is that the allowance made for family and other concessions runs counter to the logic of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, is there less <span class="highlight">welfare</span> distributed as a result of this Budget or as a result of this income tax measure than there was hitherto? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the growth of output is maximised, a government has neither income taxation concessions to confer nor <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to confer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countries with low rates of growth have no <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to confer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not members of the Opposition know that the problem with the British taxation system after the war was that insufficient incentive to the people subject to that taxation system was allowed and while the British Government devoted itself to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the years immediately after the Second World War, British growth was retarded right throughout the 1950s because that principle was forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More measure is made in order to draw distinctions between people at different income levels in relation to their contributions to Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than occurs in almost any other country in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use talking about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> on its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about nothing if we talk about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> on its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> cannot be administered in a vacuum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply means that if <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is to be administered with respect to taxation, if taxation is to be reduced - and this has been the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme of the Government - one can apply oneself only to the 29 or 30 per cent of the increase to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an amount, of $400tn in the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Government’s term of office the number of companies that control the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the destiny of millions of people has fallen remarkably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first and most apparent one is that this Bill is another instance of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service being provided by instalments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feci that this is not the way in which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services should be provided in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a full explanation of the overall objectives of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service policy by the Government, not only in terms of what it has implemented and how that is evaluated in terms of service to the community but. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how this meshes into a broad long-term plan proposing adequate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for the benefit of the whole community and of the whole man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has not been done so far, nor have we had a philosophical explanation of the basis upon which the Government promotes its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in turn, throws up the inconsistent manner in which we develop our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, not only at the Federal level but at the State level too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I make the criticism quite strongly that this is another example of a disjointed approach to the provision of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I would appreciate a fuller analysis of the facts of the Commonwealth’s extension of its commitment to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services where there is already a State commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as far as  1  can see the situation, when the Commonwealth increases its commitment to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for which the States have already accepted a commitment the tendency is for the States to withdraw commensurately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, 1 propose in a few minutes to suggest that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service as it operates anyway ought to be phased out in favour of an expansion of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Ontario, Canada, I had the opportunity of discussing with people involved in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services their approach to this sort of assistance for people who have received injuries and have to go back into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s proposal is to set up, as I have mentioned many times before, regional departments of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> harnessing the co-operative support of the State governments, local authorities and voluntary agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to ensure - and it is a public responsibility for the regionalised departments of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - that the staff serving these sheltered workshops are adequately trained and that where they should be professional people they are in fact professional people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well meaning people can do a good job in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, but in those areas where they have some particular ability to serve the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Labor Party does is to spurn the piecemeal blight which affects Government thinking in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  announced last year that this Government has given rehabilitation a high priority in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, during 1969-70 I made grants totalling $203,000 to Aboriginal organisations and other bodies to enable them to make their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other activities more effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am worried about is his <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have said is that there are clear areas of public need in Australia in health, hospital and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was driven home to me after I had the good fortune recently to investigate mental health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia has the highest standard of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main problem is arising probably because of a failure to mesh in the mental health services concept with the concept of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, also on a community basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rice in a publication ‘Estimating the Cost of Illness’, issued by the United States Department of Health, Education and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in 1966, estimated that mental illness alone in the United States cost $7 billion in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a person on this side of the House who would not prefer, if we lived in the kind of a world in which it would be practicable, to spend all our resources on national development, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and education which are matters of great concern to all honourable members in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like the Committee and the country to know that the Department of the Navy is seeking on every possible occasion to see where and how any of the timetables can be reasonably cut to ensure that the best possible equipment is provided for those who serve in the Navy and, furthermore, to ensure that the Royal Australian Navy, as it faces the very difficult years ahead, will make the maximum contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and security of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are men who develop specialised expertise in a field which cannot be gained anywhere else in the community, and through the way in which their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is being indifferently regarded by the Government they are being pressured out of the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So whilst there is in Australia a diminution of our involvement in State housing - it is on the skids and going down as fast as can be - we find that in other comparable countries such as the United States which I have just mentioned, but there are others which I could mention if more time were available, housing is being considered more and more in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> context and greater assistance is being given to people to overcome the competitive situation regarding the availability of finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a large majority in the 1967 referendum the Australian people gave power to the Commonwealth to legislate for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know, although 1 am not likely to be told and the House is not likely to be informed, why the Budget increases the proposed vote for this body by about 13 per cent, which is a greater percentage increase than was accorded to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said was that when the strike broke out the Aboriginals established a strikers camp near the Wave Hill <span class="highlight">welfare</span> settlement and that subsequently they went to the site of Wattie Creek which was the site of their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not give me any satisfaction to be saying some of these things, but it is transparently obvious to any person interested in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this place that these problems exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us would take away from the Minister his sincerity and dedication to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over a number of years, the Victorian Government, through its Department of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, has given assistance to families receiving Commonwealth pensions, such as widow’s pensions and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Springs is growing very fast - the problem in relation to the aged and the housing and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of them will not reach crisis proportion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Methodist Church, like the municipality, is concerned about the need for the provision of social services and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The centre is to be used to provide for the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people in the area and, according to the surveys that have been made, there is a very great need for such a service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Churches of other denominations in the area are providing part-time social workers, and the Victorian State Government has provided a full-time <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to refer to the book containing the constitution, rules and platform of the Australian Labor Party and particularly to page 20. which under the heading ‘Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>’ deals with pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

      <li>Let me state briefly lo the Committee that the plight of the pensioners, of the sick and the needy, is to be dealt with by what is termed social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></li>

    <p>If the Government can find money in that way it should make it available to provide assistance for more than 1 million people dependent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not quibble at money being provided for essential services but I do say that the Government’s priorities in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are completely upside down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the first page of this letter to the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  of 8th October 1970 it states: 1 am writing to you on behalf of the Pensioners’ Little Budget Campaign Committee which consists of people who are not themselves pensioners but who have joined together in a voluntary capacity to urge upon your government new initiatives in  the field of pension and post retirement <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, following the introduction of the recent Federal budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament and say: ‘For once the Prime Minister has listened to me and 1 am willing to introduce a little Budget Let him give a stimulating approach to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, not the old decadent approach be has brought to the Ministry which we thought had gone when he was elevated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only conclude that in the current Budget the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> voices in the Cabinet were not heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government allows that to happen and then does not correct its mistakes in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> side of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could not justify the Government’s inaction and the fact that it had completely ignored the representations that had been made to it by those who are responsible for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of exservicemen in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is time that a responsible Minister - one who spoke with, I believe, some sincerity when he sat on the back bench, on the abolition of the means test and the inadequacy of the income received by pensioners - spoke in his reply about the miserable 50c increase that he gave to the pensioners in this Budget and which has led to the kind of representations that every honourable member in this Parliament, whether he sits on the Opposition side or the Government side, has received from the various organisations which are concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I implore him to pay attention to those people in his electorate who, I understand, have visited his office from time to time, have written letters to him from time to time and are disgusted because he will not pay attention to their needs as far as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst he was in Australia his 4 children were under the care of the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is a crisis in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further still, we would not find, as we have found for the last couple of years, that a substantial amount of the money provided for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> remains unspent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly a remarkable situation that money allocated to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should remain unspent when so much is required to achieve the purpose for which the money was appropriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of these sections, which require the expenditure of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> moneys on them in some way or another, will have to be dealt with differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to figures available from the Departments of Health and Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>  in  Western Australia, about 13 per cent of the- fullblood Aboriginals in the Kimberleys now have or have had leprosy and, according to  Dr Davidson  of the Health Commission, it is never claimed that they are cured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also he belongs to a very conservative political group as regards most social and political exercises and therefore we make very little advance in the material <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the basic recommendations was that the Aborigines <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Board should be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiries and investigations of the committee indicated that the Aborigines <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Board in New South Wales had not fulfilled its function and had not done the job that it was hoped it would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was coincidental that at about the time the report of this all party joint committee was presented to the Parliament the Aborigines <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Board embarked on some improvement projects - and I am speaking from only personal experience here– at least in one quarter of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, there came the time when the Parliament of New South Wales in its wisdom implemented the report of the select committee and said that the Aborigines <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Board, should be dissolved and its functions taken over by the various departments of State that were charged with the care and responsibility and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in due course it was decided by the Government of New South Wales that the Aborigines <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Board would cease its operations and would be in fact dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accepted the recommendation of the Board because this decision was made by the Parliament in good- faith in the belief that more would be done in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and in the sphere of social advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole burden of work in this quarter of the State has now been given to an officer of the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department who has already been called upon to cover a tremendous area and to tackle very many complex problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the basis of my speech I quote the petition which I presented in this House this morning as the first of a series that will be presented dealing with the question of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and housing in the south west land division of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that there is a crisis in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the south west land division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a table which I have received from the State Minister for Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> showing the amounts that have been received from the Commonwealth and the amounts that have been spent by the State on Aboriginal housing from 1955-56 to the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is payable, during the year that commenced on the first day of July, 1970, to each State, for the purpose of financial assistance in connexion with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and advancement (including housing), of the Aboriginal people of Australia living in that State, amounts not exceeding in the whole the amount specified in the First Schedule to this Act opposite to the name of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the amount of $4,800,000 is used for housing, as specified in the Bill, the balance is to be used for other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or advancement of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way to regard this is that $2.2m is left for expenditure throughout the 6 States for all the other purposes under the headings of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the Migration Act 1958-1968; the Navigation Act 1912-1968; in Queensland the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders’ Affairs Acts 1965-67; the Vagrants, Gaming and Others Offences Acts 1931-1967; in Western Australia the Licensing Act 1911-1968; the Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Act 1963; the Native (Citizenship Rights) Act 1944-1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all honourable members on this side of the House, and I am sure quite a few honourable members on the other side, would agree that there is a need for a much more comprehensive programme for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and housing of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the people who are concerned with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters at the reserve are faced continually with the problem of finding sufficient housing for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay a tribute to the local <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committees in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will help the progress and development of Aboriginal people; they will help also in providing housing and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be advanced into our Aboriginal population - I feel it cannot go very quickly but still it is going - and these people deserve a pat on the back for the efforts they along with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committees in these places are making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the conference proposed the setting up of an elected body representing Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on a regional basis to take over the administration of their affairs, their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and also the disposal of government finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is high dme the Minister had support from the Cabinet and from this party to assert that the values that are important to Australians are not those represented by Vestey’s which is getting land for a few cents a square mile, but the interest of human <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that a greater opportunity is not given to honourable members to debate these matters because I think they are just as fundamental to Australia’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as are questions such as defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While he was in Australia his  4  children were under the care of the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department; so government departments had some knowledge of him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The administration of the Territory covers complex matters such as the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginals, development and the administration functions of the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today I had the privilege of presenting to the Parliament a petition on behalf of those people, as did another Western Australian, the honourable member for Forrest  (Mr Kirwan),  requesting that earnest consideration be given to the crisis in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which exists in Western Australia, that urgent attention be given to providing town housing to all Aboriginal families with a breadwinner, and that further <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance in the form of homemaker assistance, that is, a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer to guide them in home settlement, be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are some 364 applications for Aboriginal housing held by the Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department in Perth alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only hope that the State Housing Commission or the Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department can help them for they and others have walked the streets of Perth and met with refusal after refusal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must we tolerate such a situation that when a doctor prescribed to an invalid pensioner, a native, that he leave Narrogin in the country to go to Perth to receive weekly treatment at the city hospital the patient was told by some bureaucrat in the Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department to return to the country reserve as there was no hope of city accommodation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though appreciated, it underlines our laxity in this field and without question leaves this country open to international criticism in the field of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what amazes me is that the people responsible for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these Aboriginals accept this as a matter of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The records of the Aborigines <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Boa id relating to Crown Land reserved for the use of Aborigines were incomplete and at present action is in hand to bring those records up to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there is a crisis in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population -explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my opinion this is far outside the wishes of the producer and shows a disregard for his <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members may like to contrast this Chifley pension with the rates of $16 a week for a single person and $14.25 a week for each of a married couple, proposed in the present Bill, and to draw their own conclusions about the extent of the Government’s continuing interest over the years in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he said as an expression of the Government’s philosophy on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is worth repeating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not worried about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the magnificent symbol of conservative social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> achievement proposed for the 1970s and, to boot, there is added a means test within a means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To realise this one has only to look at a table showing percentage expenditures on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government proves by refusing to act in this respect is how backward it is in its thinking on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of what he has put forward as far as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> thinking is concerned has been superseded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see no radical rethinking, no fresh concepts emerging, no efforts to remould the sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> practices, policies and values which apply in this community and yet clearly we need new values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need a system of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes that will back this up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not of much use giving money to people with need and more especially people with chronic need unless you have the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to back up this sort of assistance to help people to become selfsufficient, to maintain their self-respect and to uphold their personal dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada and Australia are comparable countries in this sort of thing and certainly in economic terms and the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes that this country is capable of achieving, lt is quite clear that Australia has the capacity to introduce this sort of system for the benefit of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the power to do it and having the power we must fulfil the responsibility to introduce these things; to give people a sense of security and to assure them that the community is concerned about their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that in times of crisis need especially there will bc adequate support for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must introduce a system of regionalised social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes, a subject I have raised many times before in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by suggesting that this House should refer the total area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, not only the benefits now provided but also the funds of services which should be provided, both financially and by way of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes backing up financial services, to a select committee of this House so that we can have some objective, in depth, analyses of the needs in this community and so that appropriate recommendations may be made to this House on the kind of policy which should be developed in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been too much secrecy surrounding the work conducted by the Department of Social Services on policy matters affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of many human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reforms in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> introduced by that Labor Government make a long list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a question of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and in fact we have all expressed concern about this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 remember making a speech in this place about an unmarried mother who was paid a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit of 35/- a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation has been brought about by the Government’s total lack of coherent planning or policy in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, combined with a complete lack of responsibility in its decisions affecting the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the needs of such people are far from placated, and all the other desirable features of a comprehensive social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme are ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article refers to the proportion of gross national product which is expended by a number of countries on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Scandinavian countries spend 10.9 per cent of their gross national product on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; the member countries of the European Economic Community spend 15.2 per cent; Canada 9.9 per cent; the United Kingdom 8.6 per cent; Switzerland 8.2 per cent; New Zealand 6.6 per cent; the United States of America 5.9 per cent; and in Australia the figure is down to 5.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Canadian pension plan was introduced in 1968. lt is a comprehensive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not related to a national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have reached the stage in this country where there is a need for a royal commission to inquire into the whole question of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when there is the possibility of export rape seed, field peas, feed barley, and six-row barley we find that investment and effort have not been put into the production of seed crops, some old and some new, which could very welt have a marked effect on the future export potential and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the capital cost of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> works is higher than the amounts which can be raised by community service organisations or local government authorities on a voluntary basis <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, all of us feel that our own political party has a unique contribution to make towards the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is more, they can be made to serve as a basis for the sound formulation of social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of Australia’s most urgent needs are in the fields of education, health and public <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, urban development, and financial assistance to underdeveloped countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me add two further points about the Chifley social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, we must talk about it because the contents of this Bill, and especially the way in which the Bill was foreshadowed, raise fundamental questions as to what our attitudes should be on not only pensions but also the whole social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of discussing the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aims appropriate in an affluent democracy and instead of discussing need, all of us too often have been content to deal in statistics, averages, percentages, tables, indices and summaries and having exhausted all these things, in reciprocal abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement came as a shabby kind of repudiation of all the protestations by the Government, at the time of the introduction of the Budget in August of last year and in a debate only a couple of weeks before this measure was introduced, that no more money could be found for pensioners or for any form of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the contribution that is made for pensioner <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the face of ever increasing costs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The European Economic Community countries pay out 15.2 per cent of their gross national product in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, Scandinavia pays 10.9 per cent, Canada 9.9 per cent, the United Kingdom 8.6 per cent, Switzerland 8.2 per cent, New Zealand 6.6 per cent, the United States 5.9 per cent and Australia, with a means test loaded on to it, pays 5.5 per cent, trailing all those countries with which we ought to be able to compare ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when Australia was either in front or near the front as far as its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a poor show that many of the grants which the Government makes to help pensioners in the provision of housing, senior citizens centres, domiciliary services and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> offices are conditional on local governments or State governments matching those grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although not as eloquently as the honourable member has asked I want to know when debates on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will get out of the level of We gave them more than you gave them when you were in office’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have progressed so much surely our hopes and aspirations with regard to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should also have risen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong does, that we should have a national inquiry into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and we should genuinely try to remove social services from the realm of politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 cannot recall - I am sure that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  will agree - one Budget when the Press, the television stations and the people of this country have universally said ‘What a wonderful Budget for the people of this country’ or ‘What a wonderful <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget this is’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Sheridan,  the officer at Wyong of the State Department of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, had been handling the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In helping this woman he went as far as the State Department of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> can go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system with flexibility, one that does not require a person to fit into section A sub-section (1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a proper social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system the basis for assistance would be need and no other qualification should be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On top of that they are expected to assist in meeting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have used the pensioners and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purely and simply as a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Combined Pensioners Association has attested constantly to the inadequacy of existing provisions for those who through infirmity, ill fortune or old age have been forced to rely for extended periods on the benefits of our so-called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the goals and principles of Labor’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy have been set out, the necessary administrative flexibility will only be possible if all involved recognised that the content of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is the process of interaction of all involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The success of Labor’s approach to planning for the future in this field will depend on the willingness of both social security and social service agencies to work together for the social and political goals involved, and on the co-operation achieved among social, medical, vocational and other members of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real danger facing the Australia of the future is that we could retain the post-depression neurosis as the basis for our thinking about <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential for Labor to be aware of the rationalisations behind this relegation of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to the bottom of the priority list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is often argued that the development of adequate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes would reduce the will to work or reduce the competitive struggle which keeps society going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One need only look at those countries which have highly developed <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- services - such as Canada and Scandanavia - to see that productivity continues to remain high, and improves as the standard of living improves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor is aware that the wrong questions have been asked about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure over the post-war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The needlessly expensive consequences of inadequate social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision can be well illustrated by considering the immediate cost of the breakdown of a single large family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most important item of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme must therefore be the development of a new spirit in this country - a spirit of human fellowship which will create a collective national effort for better conditions for all members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In determining the appropriate content for the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme one of the greatest difficulties is to decide how much emphasis should be placed on meeting the needs of individuals and families in trouble and how much to place on overall schemes which improve the standard of living of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unrealistic to expect that decentralisation of functions such as education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, urban planning, resource development and law enforcement can be achieved without a regionalisation of local and semi-government authorities and a rationalisation of finances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the demand exceeds the resources and the money is raised only to send it competing for the demands, that is bad economics and bad for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth assists development generally by helping to create a climate for investment, by making available grants and loans, by establishing special financial channels to assist private enterprise, and by investment in such responsibilities as civil aviation, telecommunications, health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, basic research and exploration programmes, in none of these things does the Government act unilaterally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has become a matter of politics, rather than humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1952, the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, introducing the Fisheries Bill, informed the House that the intention of the legislation was to provide for conservation of the fishery resources of Australia, The Government now believes that the Act should be broadened to provide not only for conservation but also for the orderly conduct and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the fishing industry, including the rational utilisation of the living marine resources and the rational development of the fishing industry at all levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words it was not to be considered as though it were a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there has never been an advance in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, or in public economic management that such members have ever received in any other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are, of course, very concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people who live in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and development of Aboriginals affect more than one department, a ministerial committee will be appointed to study the special needs and problems of Aboriginals and to advise ways of improving them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These vary from day to day but range across such matters as the state of the economy, the Commonwealth’s role in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, relations with the States - so important in a Federation - and external relations and defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus we have the situation in Victoria referred to by the Maternal and Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Officer of South Melbourne Council, Doctor Dora Bialestock, who was quoted in the ‘Age’ of 14th November last year as saying that the largest portion of the Victorian Government’s subsidy for preschools was going to the more affluent suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While it guarantees to all children in the Australian Capital Territory the right to 1 year of preschool education, the assistance which the Commonwealth gives to the States in the form of capital grants for pre-school teacher colleges if of only marginal assistance and reflects a sense of concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australian children which is only slightly greater than English governments in the eighteenth century showed towards Dame Schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I continued to press his case after his induction and his psychiatrist in Perth, on hearing that he was in the Army, wrote immediately to the Department saying that it was his opinion that this lad should not be in the Army because that would be extremely detrimental to his health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did so, as I recall, against a background of concern that the care, development and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children whose mothers worked should be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The estimates of expenditure on education and public health in the accompanying table may of course be compared with similar figures for other countries, and the honourable member is referred to the United Nations Yearbook of National Accounts Statistics’, which shows for many countries, current expenditure oa education and health, and public authority current expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-55-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have tried to trace through something of the impact of this lack of trust and the pervading presence of outside influence on Cabinet on one important sector of public policy, that is the defence of this country and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of members of the forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Vietnamisation has tended to become the sort of catchcry that is used for the justification of many activities, but in governmental action, in the capacity of the South Vietnamese forces to defend themselves and in the field of assistance and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies this Government in South Vietnam is beginning to reach out to the people to an extent that it never had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only reason for this is that the Commonwealth Government - this Government which claims to have some sort of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy - has an absolute contempt for people who are psychiatric patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I cannot help feel that in large measure it is a power given to judges to bolster their need for believing that the sentences they impose will not be undone by subsequent decisions by psychologists, social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, and others who are charged with the duty of observing prisoners and assessing their chances of successful reintegration into society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parole boards receive opinions from psychiatrists, psychologists, prison officials and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> people, and with the growing experience and expertise that they, acquire, they make a decision as to, whether a prisoner should be released by being parolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It reflects not a justifiable concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of family farms impoverished through no fault of their owners, but the servitude of the Minister for Trade and Industry to large scale and corporate farming interests and the servitude of the Prime Minister to the banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps nothing so clearly demonstrates the bankruptcy of the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy than its gesture on pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degrees of difficulty have to be borne in mind against 2 principles which ought to motivate a Budget analysis: What are the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in it and what are the attitudes within that Budget to the position of human capital? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition spent very little time dealing with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in this Budget, and well he might because within those economic constructions the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions have been real; they have  Men  generous and they have been just. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitudes to family <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, almost not mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, in view of his adoption of a new, strange family code at Launceston, are well understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the attitudes to family <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are also real in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated that two of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of a Budget are its attitude to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and its attitude to human capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the strategy is to dampen down Australia’s economic growth - already one of the lowest among the advanced nations of the Western world - ignore the needs for upgrading education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and to take no effective remedial action to end the rural slump. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again I am reminded by the presence of the Minister for the Navy that if a member seeks to gain access to a psychologist’s report, a psychiatrist’s report or a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer’s report that might have been acted upon he will be told: *No, it is confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can we take it that the Minister’s rebuff is the sole product of the trumpeted review to improve social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> promised by the Prime Minister in March this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final point I wish to make is that the relationship of one country to another in an exchange sense is vital to its economic and trading interests and when we do take our decision we will, as the Prime Minister said in his statement, take a decision that is in the best interests of the country’s economy and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Left unchecked, the rate of price increases would soon erode the gains we propose for pensioner and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget in fact provides for substantial increases in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, defence, education and the arts, assistance to rural industries, and other areas of essential activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me just mention social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as one example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government looked at various possible measures in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, my Government has acted responsibly by matching its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme to what we have judged can reasonably be raised from taxation and other revenue sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These increases in pensions, child endowment and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and repatriation benefits should ensure a welcome improvement in the standard of living of those dependent on them, even after allowing for the faster rate of price rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>We are also making substantial contributions to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, to education and the arts, and we have established a department whose functions include examination of environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Budget which will help us achieve our great national aims of economic strength and prosperity, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should be committees such as a standing committee on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> set up in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House condemns the Budget because (a)  lt  breaks the Prime Minister’s pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for  1971-72 a  fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength and national security’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to the recommendation concerning an inquiry into the problems associated with the special care and treatment of the physically and mentally handicapped of all ages, this recommendation is closely related to the series of recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in its Report on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia which was tabled on 5th May 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969, 540 Aboriginal children were attending Administration (<span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch) pre-schools in the Northern Territory; 150 were attending mission pre-schools and 79 were attending community pre-schools operated by the Department of Education and Science - a total of 769 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much of the current thought on future planning stems from the many recommendations made at a Workshop on Health and Nutrition in Aboriginal Children held in Sydney in December 1969 and which was .attended by representatives of Universities, Public Health Departments and workers from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: ‘the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister’s pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength and national security’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One was the failure of the Government to provide programmes for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength and national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recommending this, I do not detract from the excellent work that has been done by the nursing staffs, by the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch of the Northern Territory Administration and by everyone connected with the running of these hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that much more needs to be spent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and other important fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view is that State aid should be for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the State and for all the people in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can throw off the crushing burden of rural industry, led to bankruptcy and bewilderment by this Government, we can never really afford the urgent measures so desperately needed in the fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and all the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three main sections of the Budget account for some 56,231 m. They include defence, the first responsibility of a national government, which will require SI, 252m, and the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund and repatriation, over $2,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in a Budget of $8.654m a sum of about S2,000m is for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, surely this represents a reasonable deal for the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spokesmen for the Government continually assert that its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies are based on the formula of first assisting those most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At every opportunity the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and his predecessor have always claimed that the Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies are based on the premise - I repeat it - of assisting those most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly appears to be a callous rejection of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a section of the population who have been written off as useless because they are no longer productive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has reversed the election promise to reduce taxation; it has ignored the pledge to pay special attention to the chronically ill; it has sabotaged the undertaking to establish a national system of kindergarten child minding” centres; it has failed in its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme to make adequate provision for those most in need; it has forgotten its indication to act on the report of the nation-wide survey on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That small percentage of people pays 471 per cent or 47c in the dollar in income tax which goes primarily to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds and which is spent by the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  lt goes to the States and to defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the Australian community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has dishonoured - as indeed has the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  - an important promise to many people in Australia who had been expectantly looking forward to a fairly radical alteration and improvement in the system of providing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have expected too that in this Budget the opportunity would have been taken to define a broad programme not only involving social security payments but actual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and mobilising the resources available in the community against poverty in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This calls, of course, not only for the provision of adequate social security payments but the development of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community; an appreciation that a complex of services has to be mobilised and integrated within the community to combat this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned before the need for regionalised development of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to back up this sort of programme of which 1 am speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 will not develop that again today but 1 would add that we do need to establish a parliamentary joint select committee on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not had such a committee since the 1940s with the result that we are still proceeding, so far as the social services and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits at the federal level are concerned, according to reflexes learnt in the 1940s - several decades ago - and which were the product of people who had been through a traumatic experience of a major world depression that shattered this country and a major world war which also seriously disrupted it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia now ranks as one of the 4 wealthiest countries and accordingly is in an eminently suitable position to provide much more generous benefits financially and much more adequate services in terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance in the field than it has done so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had such a joint committee, which I repeat we have not had since the 1940s, there would be an appropriate opportunity to develop something which we badly need - a philosophy behind what we are doing in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be backing up all that we are proposing for social security with the development of regionalised <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia as the fourth wealthiest nation in the world should be the leader, the innovator the great laboratory of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> inventiveness, innovation and improvement in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and repatriation now constitutes the largest single item of expenditure in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I repeat that no government should be expected to take over the entire responsibility of caring for those in need while members of their families contribute little to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is meant to demonstrate, admittedly in just a small way, that we are concerned and that we protest at the fact that in spite of all of the Government’s hints, suggestions, promises and implications to the contrary, the Government has still produced no basic rethinking or restructuring of the Australian social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said in earlier debates that one of our greatest difficulties and frustrations in trying to get to grips with the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system as it exists, and as it appears likely to develop, is the lack of definition and purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If nothing else it would at least clarify the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> differences between the Government and the Opposition and enable the public to judge our relative positions more sensibly than they are now able to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it can be realistically said that each one of these concessions meets, or is designed to meet, some social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But obviously social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aims which are met on this basis will be met haphazardly at best and perhaps not at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were clear in our own minds as to what our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aims are and confident enough that they were right, we might just pluck up enough courage to say to the electorate something like this- ‘Look, we know how much you love a tax deduction.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the taxation deduction system as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> instrument is regressive and totally haphazard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that progression it would probably be modest to estimate that the cost to revenue this year will be approximately $l,400m, or $200m more than the cost of our entire social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme because, as the Minister for Social Services indicated in his second reading speech, our entire programme for the forthcoming year is estimated to cost only $l,187m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we could double the funding of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme by re-allocating the sums now foregone in what can roughly be regarded as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> tax concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the special role of accommodation in any consideration of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that the Minister for Social Services, as a backbencher in many of his contributions to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> debates, was a fervent advocate for the abolition of the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (6) states: a  joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hume  (Mr Pettitt)  said earlier that this Budget provided for a record expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we do not increase any pensions, unemployment benefits, maternity benefits or child endowment, each year we would see an increase in the expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> simply because our population is forever increasing and because the number of people who are eligible for those benefits is increasing, So it is just futile and fatuous to talk about record expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways would be to look at how worth while are the provisions made in the legislation and to see how Australia fares in comparison with other countries in the provision of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The latest comparative figures available in respect of general Government expenditure on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as a proportion of the gross national product are the figures for 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They show that as a proportion of gross national product - that is, the value of all the goods and services any country produces in a year - Denmark spends 20.S per cent on its health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, the Federal Republic of Germany spends 18 per cent, Sweden spends  Hi  per cent, France spends 16.8 per cent, Italy spends 1S.8 per cent - honourable members will be wondering where Australia comes - the Netherlands spends 13.3 per cent, the United Kingdom spends 11.2 per cent, Norway spends 10.2 per cent, Canada spends 10.7 per cent and Australia spends 7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an obvious need to examine the whole hotch potch of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the Labor Party’s programme to set up autonomous regional departments of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which will involve the co-operation of State, local and Federal authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We urge too that consideration be given to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the mentally and physically handicapped and I hope that full notice will be taken of the recent inquiry carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> into this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, expenditure in the Budget on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and repatriation is the largest single item of Commonwealth expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact it is the largest amount provided for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the history of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of social services, repatriation benefits, health services, housing and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities will require an expenditure of $2,095m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This is almost $268m more than last year and $78m of this increased amount represents current improvements in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the Australian community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that the Government saw fit a short time ago to vote against the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to allow the setting up of a committee to inquire into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Committee was abandoned by the present Government’s predecessors is one of the most regrettable features of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system of this country because the Committee did commendable work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Labor speakers on this side of the House have ably supported the honourable member for Oxley in presenting to the Australian people the case for a real social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme and not the half baked, patched up propositions brought forward by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that all of these attributes fitted him to take his place in this Parliament as one of the great social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Ministers of our time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister has never been able to give effect in this Parliament to the expressions on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which he so ably put to this Parliament in days gone by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all the good intentions in the world he has proved conclusively to the Australian people and to pensioners in particular that the only way to get a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, to which even he would subscribe, is to elect a Labor government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government places its greatest emphasis upon improvements in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - under previous Liberal governments we have made great strides and under future Liberal governments will make even greater advances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself is a great disappointment to him, to honourable members on this side of the House and to about one million people who thought that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits would be given as they require them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australians should demand a drive to provide adequate social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits in line with the amendment moved by the Opposition in order that all should enjoy the prosperity and the wealth of Australia which at this time is shared by only the fortunate few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently I condemn the broad concept of this Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme but not the few meagre dollars that it is handing out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the record of what this Government has not done in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> one sees that these handouts are made just tq one section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the pattern of the development of Liberal policies on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not possible to estimate how much he has caused Victoria to lose in subsidies for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers at senior citizens’ centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have been contributing to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund in the form of taxation and getting shrunken benefits in return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have every faith in the Minister for Social Services and in his genuine concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who are dependent upon the Government for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What are the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals within that necessary economic constraint of expenditure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been intrigued to hear this afternoon the similarity between the proposals put forward by the Opposition and the proposals for a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme made by the Opposition’s other partner in power, the Austraiian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has neglected the economic analysis, with a fair assessment of how appropriate social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is to social justice within the context of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy can be pursued only with a certain type of social engineering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  pointed out that the growth in the Australian work force has been a most significant engine to enable social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> development to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret very much that, as the very basis for the determination of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy, the Opposition has adopted policies with respect to Australian family codes and immigration, which is itself an addition to the work force, which run counter to every tradition that we have had in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Party talks about social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and redistributist responsibilities while at the very base and soul of Australia’s development it has adopted principles which are contrary to 70 years of its own history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are involved in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may be outside the precise considerations of the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund but they are concerned in Australian social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pensions and repatriation benefits have again been increased and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending in the current year is estimated at $2,095m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they are sufficient to indicate that the whole intent of the Liberal-Country Party Government is to further the advancement of our nation and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, as I mentioned a moment ago, will this year absorb $2,095m, and education $346m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 4 items alone - payments to the States, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and defence - account for $6,983m out of a total anticipated expenditure of $8,833m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party attempted to discredit Labor’s estimate of costs and all of Labor’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals are answered by the oft repeated cry: ‘Where’s the money coming from?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the standards of changes in other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, the special rate pension has been treated reasonably well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attendant’s allowance is a worthy <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision but again the application is extremely limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1 have had the honour of being a Minister I have always appreciated their dedication to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That there is a crisis in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-1-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were able to study the accounts of a separate corporation dealing with postal services as closely as we should, we would note that the reasons for the deficit relate not only to interest charges but also to the fact that the Post Office provides <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and other very necessary services for the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These concession rates represent in effect a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations ranging from religious, charitable and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations to social and recreational clubs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that that policy pursued is in the great interests of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our economy and of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: ‘the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister’s pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength and national security.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I appeal to them on the third ground of our amendment, that is, that this Budget produces no programmes for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength and national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, we have a Budget that provides nothing even in the short term that could be construed as a programme for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength and national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the Government’s more able and energetic Ministers - the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who is at the table at the present time - has, as he has said, prepared a scheme for improved social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sake of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia, this Government has no right to place itself at electoral risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it surely is valid economics to provide increased subsidies in relation to increased costs in favour of those citizens whose voluntary contribution to the nation’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provides education for 22 per cent of Australian youth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Budget produces no programmes for high national objectives of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic strength or national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another reason why there would be interference to something that is already contributing greatly to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there is a crisis in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance for example the Jewish Family <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> organisation in Melbourne, which has been interesting itself in this field, but lately this matter has taken on a new dimension by reason of the pioneering work done by Alderman Joan Pilone and the City Council in Sydney in the establishment of the Beehive Industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gratefully acknowledge the lead that has been given in this field by such activities as those of the Jewish <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> organisation in Melbourne and particularly of course the initiative shown by Beehive Industries in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They too have spent their lives in an endeavour to promote the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia and its people and they must be given consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the reasons why  1  am so against payroll tax being transferred to the States is that I believe this son of taxation should be used specifically for other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures - indeed, let us include child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done that but even these measures have not been sufficient for the State governments to be able to cope with the tremendously increased demands on their services - services which I think should have the highest priority, those that happen to fall within the responsibility of the State governments, namely health, many aspects of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and, most particularly, education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget does affect all matters including employment levels, expenditure and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this it has become traditional it is even written into standing order 81  -  that the Parliament becomes the forum upon which to debate any issue affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and happiness of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The share of gross national expenditure going through Government hands is still far too low in order to provide adequately for the community’s needs in such areas as education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Value in terms of potentially improved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, improved education and improved environmental conditions will be lost and will never be achieved again no matter how much the performance of the economy is improved in subsequent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will be used for grants to non-governmental organisations for a wide range of purposes - for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work, adult education, the provision and running of hostels, support of the arts, crafts and cultural activities, support of youth and sporting activities, Aboriginal housing societies and for pre-schooling provided by private organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effectiveness of these policies will be measured by the rate at which progress over the coming years justifies the elimination of measures of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance directed at Aboriginal Australians as such, by the increasing contribution to the national product by Aboriginal Australians, and also by the increasing contribution to the varied pattern of Australian social life made by their traditions and culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government announced its desire to introduce a scheme to assist with child-care centres in November last year against a background of concern that the care and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the children of working parents should be adequately safeguarded and that such children should have every opportunity for the fullest development, intellectually, socially and physically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was interested in this regard in an observation made a few weeks ago by the Premier of Queensland when talking about the difficulties which he and his Government face in recruiting sufficient people to work in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for Aborigines, lt has often seemed to me that those who demonstrate, whatever the form of demonstration, might well look to more beneficial and fruitful form in displaying their concern than simply to seek publicity, whatever the form of search might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Involving, as it does, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of tens of thousands of Australian families, this matter of urgency is of the utmost importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The passage of almost 2 years since its introduction in January last year has dramatically highlighted in the most compelling way the failure of a system whose objective is not the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people, but the protection of property and profit for vested interests in the medical insurance business and the propagation of party dogma at any expense to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government decided finally that health insurance should not be used as the vehicle for assistance to large families because other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures such as taxation concessions and child endowment currently provide assistance of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned on Tuesday night of last week, this should be seen as part of the total development of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community - an integrated, balanced plan for the provision of adequate health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> protection for the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has been particularly critical of the standards of nursing homes and has also claimed that the Government, in announcing its intention to provide higher patient benefits, has been concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> not of patients but of nursing home proprietors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The collapse of the Government’s subsidised scheme shows clearly that its interest was not in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the poor but in the continuation of its health insurance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, we know very little about the following: Firstly, the distribution and accessibility of general practitioners in poorer areas; secondly, the extent to which the poor are forced to use outpatients departments of public hospitals which are not designed to meet such needs; thirdly, the efficiency and economy of the use of outpatients departments by the poor; fourthly, the incidence of illness among the poor and the nature of this illness, especially chronic illness; fifthly, the connection between the ill health of the poor and the general pattern of their life style such as diet, hygiene, social and psychiatric problems and their promptness in seeking medical care; and, sixthly, the need to link health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major components of the programme were $500,000 a year for housekeeper and home help services, $500,000 a year for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers’ salaries and approved capital expenditure in senior citizens centre, and $250,000 for paramedical services to aged persons in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another advantage of the State-run institutions is that they provide the sort of ancillary services - physiotherapy, occupational therapy and so on - which are essential to any chance of rehabilitation and to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the aged if they are to live a reasonably happy life in the evening of their days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of nursing home care is perhaps the most serious problem in the whole structure of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, the effect that the deterrent charge will have will vary according to the degree to which the doctor is prepared to compromise his patient’s medical <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in order to safeguard the patient’s financial <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This assistance is useful because a number of organisations are working in various social and sporting fields, undertaking <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a sense, its purpose is largely of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one admits this proposition the next logical step is to assess the scheme, using as one’s cri* terion the possibility of attainment of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will affect directly up to perhaps a quarter of a million rural producers and, indirectly, perhaps, one million people, lt is tremen dously important, not only in economic terms in connection with balance of payments but also in social terms from the point of view of human <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the suffering of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The wool price subsidy can be justified on economic and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds only if the collateral provisions to promote restructuring are substantially more far reaching and effective than the current reluctant attempt to admit the need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although from time to time we have new statements and new government offensives in some direction on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> always there later comes the shock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But for reasons which had nothing to do with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> when there was a change of Prime Minister, a new, ingratiating attitude was taken towards the Government of Queensland with this egregious failure as its record and it has been left in immunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This afternoon we have heard Opposition speakers very clearly illustrate that the Government cannot continue to pass the buck in regard to responsibility for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that he had a genuine interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people and certainly a genuine interest in the social work that  Mrs Wilding  was carrying out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I suggest that it was the influence of this gentleman in particular, who has taken action in the past to prevent  Mrs Wilding  from receiving the assistance that may have been accorded to her by the Department for the carrying on of the very essential and valuable work that she had undertaken at Mount Gravatt, which has driven her to resign and driven her out of the hostel in order to illustrate the frustrations which she has faced, in working for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginals, through the incompetence of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister who at present administers the Department must bear a heavy responsibility for the failure to see the problems not only in this field but also in other areas of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Queensland which are developing so quickly that it is almost too late to overcome them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, is it appropriate for a member of the Reserve Bank Board, which must, as part of its charter, operate in such a manner as to ensure the economic prosperity and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia, to be directly involved in selling off Australian land through 1,700 salesmen operating in a manner which would be approved by no stock exchange in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In housing, as in so many other areas of national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, this Government substitutes inertia and expediency for planning and positive policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are the side effects from the fact that the family is financially overcommitted, and of course this is when the Government has to do something about social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, social services, health or in some other field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This committee revealed that one of the main factors affecting the attraction of migrants to Australia and their decision to remain here was Australia’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of our belief in that regard, the basis of our policy includes the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and integration of all our citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The humble petition of citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1, It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of us had hoped that the appointment of a new Minister for the Navy who comes from Sydney would see a mellowing of the old hard line which characterised the attitude of some of his predecessors from Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, none of whom could be expected to have the indigenous interest in Sydney’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the present Minister for the Navy  (Dr Mackay). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 simply point out once more, as I have pointed out in this House for about 10 years, that the logic of the taxation system of deductions runs counter to the logic of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How anybody can justify this sort of thing in a system of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is, to my mind, the height of absurdity, yet the same sort of thing is repeated in some of the other deductions that are currently allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 maintain that the greatest barrier to the development of an adequate social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system in this country is the loss of revenue that is built into the income tax structure by reason of this higgledy-piggledy array of deductions that have been built up applied originally in the main to dependants but only one-third of which now cover dependants while the rest are a ragbag of assortments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Available revenue would be increased which could well lead to the establishment of a better pattern of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that would be according to need and not according to income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will notice that the estimates of my Department for the Northern Territory this year provide for a total expenditure of $16m on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which is an increase of 13.7 per cent on the estimates for the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that I should say something about the dimension of the problem of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because it is only when there is a real appreciation in this regard that there will be an awareness of what has to be done in the future and the time scale to which this can reasonably be related. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other circumstances it might be desirable for him to be absent, and with the sort of Prime Ministerial leadership we are getting it might be better if he stayed absent, but the facts are that at this moment the Parliament is meeting and I doubt if his contribution to the nation’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by his absence overseas warrants his being away from the Parliament when it is meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the people who have been concerned with the problems they are facing in Australia and who have contacted me have said that they could go home if they had not sold up, left their positions of employment, bringing qualifications to Australia which would be normally acceptable but because of the current economic trends they are unable to fit into the community and often place a heavy burden on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services both official and voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that when I speak on these matters I realise very fully that the measures I am asking for will not affect a great number of people, but they are a section of the community which is helping to promote the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia generally, and they are utilising for the benefit of the community areas which are very difficult to utilise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those are historical kinds of assumptions, but in later times more  and  more has it been expected of the local authorities that they should go into the fields of health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the year 1969 in Brunswick - these were figures given in a 1971 submission - out of a total expenditure by the Municipality of Brunswick of $1,420,000, an amount of 8165,000 - that is, close to 12 per cent of the available income of the Municipality of Brunswick - was spent on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is illogical because a scheme of this nature is primarily a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What disturbs me is this: When the money is made available the Government announces that it has a big scheme to cover home care services, senior citizens centres or social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers and a lot of publicity is given to the announcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 point out also that there is provision in this Act for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969-70 the Commonwealth made available $60,000 for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That amount of $60,000 was made available for the State of New South Wales for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers but not one cent of it has been used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do this because as far as I am aware - although I have from time to time made representations in this Parliament on matters concerning the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people - the peculiar problems which apply to a very small section of the community but, nevertheless, a very important one have never been placed on record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In saying this 1 do not criticise the efforts of State Government employees who look after the health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a sad thing that this legislation was not brought down in circumstances which would have enabled the whole range of people interested in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - no less the Aborigines themselves - to express their views on the legislation in order that whatever emerged from the Queensland Parliament might be the best possible legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>4120 (Hansard, 2nd November 1971, pages 2880-1) regarding social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> claims received and payments made in Canberra during the last 5 years, was the increase in the number of claims received between 1966-67 and 1970-71 attributable to the increase in population during the period or was it due to other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within our society the position of economic independence in the light of what I am putting to the House from sources regarded as fairly powerful authorities in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work emphasises that reasonable money resources play a dominant role and is essential to the mental <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen a number of reports of a scheme such as that which has been outlined by the right honourable member for Fisher and I must say that from looking at this scheme it is quite clearly an economic and social abomination because it offends against every decent <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principle appropriate to home ownership and housing that has been operative in Australia for many decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned at the outset of my speech, or soon after, it is entirely important that this Bill should be seen to be achieving or attempting to achieve a situation of improved industrial conditions generally for the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country, which certainly can stand improvement in any direction in which we are able to effect it in a responsible way from this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can imagine the honourable member’s susceptibility on petitions because day after day he and some of his colleagues and the Ministers are subjected to a lot of embarrassment as the national constituency continues to barrage them with its demands for electoral reform and reform in’ respect of many matters affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition that I put before Parliament gives every member an opportunity to consider his own <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that of everybody about him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the logical thing for our own personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is to knock off at the reasonable hour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the sensible, commonsense and humane attitude is to consider the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people who make our work possible - the broadcasting monitors, the dining room staff, the attendants, the car pool drivers, the Library and Hansard officers who are the innocent victims - and knock off at a reasonable hour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that in the past decade there has been a deterioration in the overall standard of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At page 1754 of Hansard, in the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, we find that under the subject of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which covers all the social service benefits, expenditures had fallen from S3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So one finds a rather blemished record - to say the least - on the part of the Government in its achievements in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of justice we receive under the sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principles that the Government espouses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the basic principles that should be the basis on which we develop our whole approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With any <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system the crucial result is what actually goes into the pockets of the persons receiving the benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let Government supporters tell us what the position is today in Phuoc Tuy Province and those areas where Australian blood was shed, where Australian money was spent and where we devoted a great proportion of our resources to help establish the sort of administration that we believed should be established in South Vietnam - an honest, forthright administration working for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party gave the primary producer the opportunity to live as he should - as a human being with a good return for his products, a fair return to the worker, and in every way take his place in society not as a debtor but as a proud man adding his contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After the discussion was over, the point was made that a number of the participants in the audience were public servants and the fact that they were public servants had hindered and made it difficult for them to participate in discussion on the subject of health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Qualifications for registration as a midwife, as a child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> nurse or as a mental nurse are similar to those referred to above, but with the appropriate term used in place of ‘general nursing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said then that the Government felt that so far as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was concerned it was ‘unfinished business’, to quote my words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, too, in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services do we believe the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister is really interested in and is trying to protect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the whole community he should have taken steps to initiate action to raise productivity in individual industrial undertakings which, of course, would be the main responsibility of managements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us face the facts: The more difficult the Act, the greater is the collusion to defeat its provisions between the larger unions in the interests of their members and the employers with whom they are dealing, who co-operate in the interests of common sense and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their employees, who are associated with the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without committing himself to any attitude, will he undertake to have the question of Commonwealth responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a single mother and her child included on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of State and Commonwealth Ministers for Social Services and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact as stated in the article, that the new arrivals, despite some help from church <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies or close relatives who are virtually new arrivals themselves, live by borrowing money, accepting low-paid jobs, paying lowstandard rentals and on handouts of food, clothes, furniture and hire purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>OVERSEAS STUDENTS  Mr GRAHAM-  Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen reports of a survey conducted by the Overseas Students Service at a Victorian university in which it is alleged that many Asian students in Australia have personal and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems and nobody with whom these problems may be discussed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now, as I have argued, on the threshhold of being threatened with a new colonialism, and the immense resources of the sea should not go to the strong; they should go to the corporate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why I believe that this Parliament, if it seeks to assert sovereignty and to settle the matter, is contributing to that extent, to the common <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  who has just resumed his seat has given  a  very good example of the general lack of interest or concern of members of the Labor Party for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who live in the country areas, including people who operate country radio and television stations and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart from the value of this industry to the economy of the State it has a real effect on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, progress and development of towns in areas where it is grown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also ask him to explore the proposal being advanced by a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer with the Catholic Migration Office in Sydney to establish some improved and continuing hostel accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the idea that somebody else is crucial to our defence, our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and our strength is an abdication of our sense of self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Results of such decisions will deviate more and more from true human <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why people who have migrated to Australia are now leaving Australia, and why there are so many leaving, particularly those from the prime source countries, is that Australia does not now compare with those countries in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and housing standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We shall never retain them in this country unless we discard our pettifogging and begrudging <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foremost among the points of agitation is the contention that the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system in Australia is relatively inferior to the systems in other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole sorry story, the whole historical cavalcade of events, makes a laughing stock of any sincerity which the Government claims about its concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our migrant community whose desires and interests have been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable members that when we talk of the United Council of Immigrants, the Council whose policy has been embraced today completely and unambiguously by the Australian Labor Party, we are speaking of the Central Council of Croatian Associations in Australia, the Italian <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Centre Co., the Netherlands Society of Sydney, the Association of Australian Slovaks, the Swiss Club of New South Wales, the Ukrainian Society of New South Wales, the Federal Council of Polish Associations, the Estonian Society in Sydney, the Hungarian Council of New South Wales, the Maltese Community Council of New South Wales, the Latvian community in Sydney, the Lithuanian community in Sydney and the Australian Romanian Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have such a cavalier attitude towards the rights of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than justice all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants or pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I go further than that and acknowledge that the Bill presently before the House, even unamended, represents an important advance in our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is further evidence of his desire to bring about major changes in our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is yet further evidence of the very real concern that this Government shows for all aspects of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I want to state once again that this Bill represents a remarkable advance in terms both of our national social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system and in the special regard which we pay to the interests of our migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even today, those of us who have been concerned with migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and have achieved some assistance for family reunions, find that there is discrimination continuing in the matter of the issue of visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The information refers only to expenditure on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as distinct from expenditure on benefits available to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since June 1969 Aborigines in New South Wales have been the responsibility of the Directorate of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the Department of Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and separate records are not maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Expenditure which was normally a charge against the Department of Native <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in respect to medical and education for Aborigines is now carried by the relevant Departments and not included in the above figures since 1962-63. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These actions include the lowering of interest rates, providing additional funds for the States, restoring the investment allowance for manufacturers, reducing personal income taxation and increasing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overall unemployment has been brought about by the August Budget of the McMahon Government and it is a tragic thing that without any thought to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people unemployment should be created like it has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The wellbeing of APPM, which employs about 4,000 people, is of tremendous value not only to the north west but also to the whole northern area of Tasmania and the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that when legislation in respect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits is before this Parliament the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  will remind his colleagues that those who can well afford to put up with the hardship of living on the salaries that they receive today are being granted huge increases which are to be backdated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has done nothing to lift the standard of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure, including child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said nothing about the people who are kept down under our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also attended a Conference of Child and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ministers held in Tasmania in March 1971 for which the particulars sought were given in my answer to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This raises a major consideration, namely, the additional burden which would be placed on the Australian taxpayer who, in 1971-72, is expected to provide some $510m from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund for health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> recommend overall planning of rehabilitation for the handicapped to increase efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister take steps to set up a semi-governmental authority for this purpose, including representatives of Departments concerned with education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and vocational matters, and voluntary organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> made a number of recommendations concerning some areas of assistance to the handicapped where, in the view of the Committee, further governmental assistance both Commonwealth and State would be appropriate; and also concerning the co-ordination of Commonwealth activities in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, did section 1 of the Bill declare that it is the public policy of the State that, in order to safeguard the life, health, property, and public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens, the production sales and use of motor fuels and the pollution caused by the additives in motor fuels is a matter affecting the public interest, and that a reduced tax on motor fuels containing grain alcohol as a substitute for lead additives is necessary for the reduction of pollution and will further serve as an incentive for the agricultural economy in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What sum has been (a) available and (b) granted for (i) home care services, (ii) senior citizens’ centres and (iii) <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers at senior citizens’ centres under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969 to each of the States and Territories in each year of operation of the Act <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-78">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The States Grants (Home Care) Act provides for the Commonwealth to, first, pay to a participating State an amount equal to half its expenditure for approved home care services; secondly, to contribute up to one-third of the capital cost of a senior citizens’ centre, on a matching basis with a participating State or a local governing body in a participating State; thirdly to pay half the salary of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer employed at, or in conjunction with, a senior citizens’ centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-78">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When will the House debate the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in respect of mentally and physically handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-123">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in respect of mentally and physically handicapped persons is very  far  reaching  in  its implications for both the Commonwealth and the States, and the recommendations of the report cover  a  wide range of issues which could affect questions of major policy in several Commonwealth Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-123">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Western Australia deserves better than this, not on any emotional, much less philanthropic, basis but on the cold hard reality of the State’s contribution to Australia’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proportionate to population, Western Australia has contributed far more than its share to the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and this can be illustrated in all basic areas, including migrant absorption, interstate trade and overseas earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is a small rise in cash <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, with an actual decline in their value, the answer to poverty, indignity and insecurity among the aged, the widowed, the returned men, the sick and the handicapped? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the time to start looking after the true <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the migrants already here - the people who suffer most from unemployment, most from the pressure in the state and parish schools, most from exorbitant land and housing costs, most from the decline of the quality of our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question I would have preferred to discuss in this context is this: Considering the sharp increase in the social services allocation and the heavy emphasis on this aspect in the Budget Speech, might it now be possible to discern at last something that we could regard as a Liberal Party plan, scheme or philosophy of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, might the Liberal Party at last have moved away from ad hocism as the basis of its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The defence vote this year is estimated to be $l,323m and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and repatriation are estimated to be $2,529m, making a total of $7,30 lm or about 70 per cent of the total Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures will be of tremendous assistance to many people in more ways than one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Citizens in South Australia are entitled to ask, as they have done, and as newspaper editorials have done so eloquently in expressing their condemnation of that action which has been taken, whether the law of the land and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community can be safely entrusted to a Premier and a Government who treat law with such contempt as honourable gentlemen opposite would have that law treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it new thinking which has caused the revision of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view, the Treasurer in the Budget presented on the Tuesday before last introduced the most wide ranging and humanitarian series of policy changes relating to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for the removal of poverty, assistance in nursing homes and similar matters that I can remember for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  which reads in part:  the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>These are significant and perhaps more dramatic steps than many of the others which have been taken, but the other measures in this social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget - and that is what it is - are also sensible and helpful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is charting a course in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which cannot ever be reversed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been forced to allocate resources from their budgets for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> when this should have been the responsibility of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Budget for the average man; it is a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides a stimulus to the economy and it includes the biggest <span class="highlight">welfare</span> packet that has ever been brought into a single Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible in the time available to me in this debate to cover all these aspects, and I intend, if I may, to devote my time solely to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects; but even then I will be unable to cover the full range that is contained in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget contains a combination of what can be achieved in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to remind the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  that despite what he has outlined as a wonderful social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, the simple fact as contained in the Budget papers themselves indicate that this year we will be spending an only slightly higher proportion of our total domestic outlay on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> compared with expenditure in the 2 previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  who preceded me in this debate, had a lot to say about social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes, but he did not say what was being done in the Budget about the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Couples with young families are struggling to raise their families and I know that their main demand in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is an increase in child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget is aimed at goals of importance to all Australians - growth and development; the adequate defence of our nation; the fostering of industry; the expansion of educational opportunity; and the continued betterment and extension of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the difficult process of determining spending priorities, our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme shows how highly we regard the need to achieve an equitable distribution to upgrade the living standards of those who most need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This could be spent towards the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition which states: the House condemns the Budget because it falls to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme fox restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have read statements attributed to  Dr Hecker  which reportedly were made in Sydney yesterday when he was making a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a decline in the philosophy of a once proud Party that its members are more concerned with enabling 2 men to get into bed together than with the profound issues which affect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they place the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of deviants above the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  on introducing one of the most popular social service <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budgets post-war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I direct my remarks to the field of social services in which some very important decisions affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of many of our best aged citizens have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment seeks to insert the following words:  the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support strongly the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  which states:  the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for  out  capital cities and regional centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  has made clear a number of times that in his recommendat.ons in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> he was determined to beat the levels which Professor Henderson has described as th: poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, the cost of the schemes that the Labor Party wanted to introduce in 1969 - its national health scheme, its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals, its education policies and its national development policies - can be met because the money is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when the Government say that it cannot increase pensions by a few dollars a week or talks about improving its miserable’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes it should be remembered that it has been socking away $500m a year into this fund which is to meet only a contingent liability, a liability which will not arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years this Government has talked about what it has done with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goals set by the Government of the Liberal and Country parties, on the other hand, in the framing of this year’s Budget are designed to build a better Australia by promoting balanced development as well as the economic and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The firm agreement to abolish the means test within 3 years means that throughout the Australian community people will .henceforth be able to benefit from the range of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to which they contribute through their taxation payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently hundreds - perhaps thousands - of Australians could be thrown out of work; yet this is a man who claims that he is concerned for the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore is quite clear as stated in the Labor Party’s proposed amendment that the Budget provides no framework for improving the standards of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and no national plan for our capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the Liberal Government in Victoria reacted critically to this proposal and said that all that the Government - his colleagues here in the Liberal Federal Government - was seeking to do was to have an inquiry which would shift the responsibility from the Federal Government to State Government authorities because of the imminent Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that we would set up a wide-ranging committee of inquiry with open terms of reference to inquire into the broad aspect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that would have special emphasis on the subject of poverty and would progressively report to a Labor government and that we would establish this inquiry, announce its terms of reference and announce the personnel of such an inquiry within 3 months of being elected to the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was possible, as in fact it was, with a national campaign to reduce tuberculosis rates among the non-Aboriginal population from 52 per 100,000 in 1947 to 15 per 100,000 by 1970, why have we not shown similar initiatives and resourcefulness and a similar moral commitment to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proposing that matter for debate I quoted the documents which had been prepared by the Church of England social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities in the diocese of Sydney - at Redfern and at Mount Druitt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other suggestion which has been made by the Australian Labor Party and by the Australian Council of Social Service is that it is too much for any one man or any one woman to conduct as wide ranging an inquiry into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as this country needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin)  and he should know the deprivation which is suffered in many fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by the people who live in so far flung an area as his area on the outskirts of the metropolis of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having obtained such an order, she has to go very many miles to a branch of the New South Wales Department ofSocial <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> before she can get the forms of assistance available from that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an area similar to the area in the electorate of Mitchell which the Anglican social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers showed to me when I made my visit early in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that in some terms they do not have a low income, but when one takes into account the amount of money they have to pay to buy a block of land, to pay off their house when they get one and to spend on fares to get to and from work, and the amount of time they have to spend in getting to hospitals or to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies* it can be seen that these are people who are deprived even if they have an income which is larger than that which Professor Henderson regards as the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that one finds either from the Minister, for Social .Services or members such as the honourable member for Mitchell is that they blame the States for every social shortcoming, every municipal shortcoming and every <span class="highlight">welfare</span> shortcoming in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had always made the excuse that it was not for Federal authorities to inquire into matters of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or social services, that these were academic matters which were better discharged by the researchers at the universities such as, of course, Professor Henderson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will break new ground in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These new nursing home and domiciliary care benefits, taken together with the other initiatives in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> announced in the Budget, demonstrate the determination of the Government to correct imbalances of opportunity within the community and to assist those who need it to receive health care and comfort without loss of dignity or independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot help but feel strong objections to the fact that what should be a key public service, as health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in other areas are regarded as a public responsibility, is not regarded in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of home care services, it will be remembered that in 1969 the Minister for Social Services with some grandiloquence outlined a programme of home care services, paramedical services, senior citizen centres, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers to be provided in these services, plus nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sentiments of the Labor Party in regard to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and unemployment benefit would ring much more truly if it practised what it preached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quite agree; it is time that the people of Australia realised that this Government is responsible for the introduction of most of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation now in operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area there is so much to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field it is always a case of too little too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not really interested in the pensioners’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, it must take a direct interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants who have been brought to this country by private project development firms which have nominated migrants and made promises which cannot be kept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The performance to date has been that of a stop-go economy, of stop-go <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes and broken promises, particularly on the means test, and of Federal Government bond rate moves which have caused soaring home loan interest rates that have been passed on by building societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the government’s job to control these developments and to direct them towards the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they have overlooked the fact that this finance is required for industries which are vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia as a nation and that it could do much to encourage people to remain in areas other than the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has shown that this McMahon Liberal-Country Party Government is concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of every section of the community, and its concern for the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians has been clearly demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, the LiberalCountry Party Government has shown a total concern for the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget will provide for taxation reductions, pension increases, social services, the lifting of the means test, housing, health, education, child <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, estate duty, Aborigines, defence, shipping, airlines, gift duty, nursing homes, special grants and fares for the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all 3 areas of which I have been speaking - inflation, growth and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - this is a Budget which deserves the commendation of this House just as it has had the commendation of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the part to which I would like to draw attention -  and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The poor need health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, whilst those in better circumstances do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities, pre-school centres, sporting fields and pavilions and public halls command priorities in newly developing areas and must compete with road, drainage and bridge construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should be entirely responsible for the cost and provision of social services, health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes as advised by local councils and considered by a board or committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention is given to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> section in the Budget and to the primary industries which are still vitally important and which in some quarters are still not given the consideration that is due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am extremely gratified by the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in the Budget, particularly the additional assistance to be given for home nursing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is helpful and beneficial in its social services and in the many <span class="highlight">welfare</span> increases given right across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The private sector fails the community by being unwilling to spend when the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community is at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Looking through the Budget a bit further we come to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and the first item dealt with specifically is education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rehabilitation part of it is supposed to have been a major social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> step in rural reconstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the measure of its concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that many people in the country cities and towns would be very pleased to hear of that lack of concern by the Labor Party for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague the Minister for Immigration has put forward in this Budget a programme for migrant integration and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That* be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: “The House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If I remember correctly, the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that great spokesman on Labor Party matters, quoted defence matters as number 7 on the list of matters which the Labor Party considered as important for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increasingly, he and his family depend on local government to provide a whole new range of basic services in health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, sport, culture and recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are few aspects of our environment, our culture or our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which can be handled adequately without involving local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today, the municipalities have responsibilities and duties in areas such as infanct <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, kindergartens, emergency social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, high contributions to road and other facilities including, in Victoria, the fire brigade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have embraced these duties because of their acceptance of social responsibility This is particularly so in some areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, where the State Govern ment has instructed local authorities that their duties did not extend into those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>because of their  experience  of the deplorab’e state of affairs which would exist in some areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> if they did not intrude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increases in pensions and the concern with the means test and with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are greater increases obsolutely and proportionately than have ever been sustained in a previous Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Commonwealth Department of Social Services with the full support and cooperation of the State departments concerned with social and child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has commissioned a family research project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for such a research project was discussed and agreed upon at the annual meeting of State <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Ministers and myself held in Brisbane last June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Social Services,  Mr W.  C. Langshaw, Under Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, who will also be representing equivalent departments from other States, and  Mr A.  S. Colliver, senior lecturer, School of Social Work in the University of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The study will have great significance for the long term development of Australian social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather remarkable that this should bc so because  the  Government has been in office for nearly a quarter of a century and until about a fortnight ago had seen little virtue in having inquiries in’.o various aspects of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not inquire into the broad aspect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the community into which the needs of the family dovetail very neatly although representing only one section of a vast range of high priority needs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the inquiry into this particular area dealt with by the Minister is to be meaningful, just as an inquiry into the broad aspect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community is to be meaningful, questions must be raised about fundamental philosophical values, about the role of society, the relationship of people within society, the position of the productive system and what its purpose is within our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the next election, when Labor is in office and sets up a broad committee of inquiry into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> we will do what we hope this Government would do in framing the terms of reference for the matter dealt with by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those in need has been cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That solution was rejected in deference to the islanders’ known political and constitutional views, to obviate complications as regards social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and to avoid imposing tax on the islanders in respect of genuine Island source income and foreign source income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume that in representing the Aborigines of Australia he is looking after their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a report in The Review, 27th May-2nd June 1972, (a) that the present manager of the Foundation has abolished the Foundation’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and cancelled such things as providing amenities for showering and shaving or a free meal for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cases who needed help to get back their self-respect and dignity before looking for a job or housing and (b) that the second floor of the building used by the Foundation, once used as emergency accommodation for Aboriginals in need, has been converted into a comfortable apartment for the present manager and his family at an alleged cost of $7,900; if so, will he investigate these allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-47-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the allegations in parts (2) and (3) are correct, will he take whatever action is necessary to ensure that Commonwealth funds appropriated for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are spent as the Parliament intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-47-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill represents but one component of a comprehensive programme being introduced by the Government in this session of Parliament to improve the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact he is saying that he does not know what the costs are, and that is not an unreasonable situation when trying to calculate the cost of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services or many other aspects of public responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was supposed to spend $2.Sm a year on a comprehensive programme covering home care, paramedical services, senior citizen centres, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work and nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the reasons why <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community have been under-developed in many ways is that the Commonwealth has tended to take the easy way out by tying its expenditure allocations to some sort of formula which requires a commitment from the States in a fixed capacity or in a fixed amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is obvious that no one person is able to fulfil all the needs that are so apparent in investigating the areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing, health and the like as they bear on the aged pensioner section of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, of course, the problem that we are confronted with today - the inadequacy of the legislation that we are confronted with today - is the inadequacy of the total funds made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to labour this point at all, but in passing it should be mentioned that lots of people, including active people in the aged persons homes organisations, are gravely concerned that in Australia we are spending 5.5 per cent of our gross national product on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other comparable countries a much greater proportion of the gross national product is devoted to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The European Economic Community countries are expending 15.2 per cent of their gross national product on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention now the percentage of gross national product expended on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objective that these measures will achieve is for these desirable developments to take place at less cost to the Government than would be the case if the alternative development of more and more nursing home beds were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to this because it must be remembered that the States themselves bear a great deal of responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is one such organisation and one such home that I have had something to do with, namely, the Judge Book Memorial Village in Eltham which is run by the Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Foundation of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this should be borne in mind in view of the comments that come from members of the Opposition suggesting that the Government is not concerned with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is surely a magnificant contribution to this sector of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gives me considerable pleasure to speak on the Aged Persons Hostels Bill this afternoon, and at the outset I offer my sincere congratulations to both the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  and the Government for what they have done in this field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is far more desirable that they should bring in the experienced people who are educationalists or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and expose all this business to sensible examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has shown a callous disregard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people living in the vicinity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, which is located in my electorate of St George, and people living in the electorates of my colleagues the honourable member for Barton  (Mr Reynolds),  the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  and the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This callous disregard for the interests and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people living in the St George electorate and surrounding areas has to stop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To return to the issue of local government authorities, the document to which I have referred points out quite well that more and more responsibilities, particularly in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, are being expected to be assumed by these bodies but that nobody gives any consideration to giving relief in regard to the payment of the sums of money involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I welcome the Bill which is a direct result of the progressive policies on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that were announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  in the Budget last month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth and States housing arrangements under which the Federal Government makes available funds to the States at a low rate of interest for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing works is another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers the activities of the Commonwealth Government in regard to war service homes and the provision of low interest finance to the State housing authorities for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing construction it becomes obvious that the Government has played a very important and necessary role in the housing industry of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind him, as he deserves to be reminded, that last year in this House there was passed a Commonwealth-State housing Bill which provided <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for those who were in greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that that legislation has resulted in the greatest drop in interest rates ever experienced in Australia’s history in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some States the interest rate on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing has dropped by up to 1.75 per cent, representing a payment of nearly $3 a week less for every week of the mortgage, for 25 or 30 years, than would otherwise have been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That assistance in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing has been introduced despite the opposition from the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand, therefore, the reluctance of the honourable member for Reid when dealing with these matters to mention in detail the areas of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His remarks are interesting because in the whole field of social policy proposed by the Australian Labor Party almost the only area in which it would impose limits in respect of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and needs is in some aspects of education - not even in housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not reasonable to expect that gross returns to primary producers should remain static and I hope that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  and the Government will give consideration to examining the position of the wheat growers to ensure that they too receive their share of the prosperity of this country and that they are contributing generally to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By introducing this measure, the Government wishes to assist Australian woolgrowers further in their efforts to advance the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget contains a far-reaching <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, part of which will be implemented by my colleague, the Minister for Health  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson and part of which falls within my own responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social services aspects of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme are covered by 3 Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expenditure on social services from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund for 1972- 73 other than that resulting from this Bill, is estimated to reach $l,327m which is an increase of $119m over the expenditure for the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as increasing the amounts spent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, 1 believe we have significantly increased the efficiency of our expenditure, so that each dollar spent provides more real <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than it would have done if the older system had remained unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Danes will also be discouraged by the less complete social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system provided in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will well recollect that the inquiry sponsored by the Department of Immigration into the reasons why such a growing higher proportion of migrants are returning home established the major reason as being that social security and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services - covering the broad conspectus of these things - in Australia are so inferior to what are available overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present Government has almost $450m of the taxpayers’ money isolated and frozen in the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund paying only one per cent annual interest instead of the long term bond rate of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we commit ourselves to developing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community, because money alone is no answer to the big <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet this Government has for so long turned its eye away from that obvious approach to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I remember the Prime Minister, once removed, having said that he was ardently opposed to abolition of the means test and that a lot more attention should be given to those people on the lower rungs of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Put together these measures provide outstanding and comprehensive social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation and they make a broad attack on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the payments which the Commonwealth makes to the States the provision under the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund is the greatest single item in the Commonwealth Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the AMA seems to be to destroy the repatriation system or to water down its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions to such a degree that it forfeits all meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems are open to abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system contains more checks and balances than any other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system operating under any <span class="highlight">welfare</span> law in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to this approach, repatriation is wasteful and unnecessary - it should be dismantled and the money spent on it diverted to other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the exservicemen, widows and dependants getting war pensions would become eligible for existing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly the special rate and intermediate rate pensioners and widows would be entitled to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government reached the situation where it felt that unless something drastic was done in these matters, as in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme, whatever possibility - it is a very remote possibility indeed - it had of recovering its lost ground would have gone completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another example of the Government’s concern for the most seriously disabled TPI and intermediate rate pensioners and its concern for the widows of deceased ex-servicemen as well as its interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of that small and very wonderful band of women who served overseas as nurses during World War I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If ever there was a member of this Parliament who has the propensity to go from one area to another trying to tell the people in each area what they want to hear, regardless of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation and frequently regardless of the interests of the industries he is referring to, the classic example of recent times has been the honourable member for Riverina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make this point because those Aborigines had been saying to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers for 16 years that they had not been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we look around at the deprived areas in Australia and the deprived schools about which We of the Labor Party talk we see that they are, typically, in the working class area - the areas with larger families, the areas where both parents go to work, the areas where there is a greater concentration of migrants, areas where there are more families dependent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and areas where more children have to leave school at an earlier age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already these things are becoming apparent and they are a warning to the rest of the medical people and the patients in this nation that Labor is determined to upset the present scheme, with all the efficiency that is built into it and the proper care and concern given by doctors for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As in any other profession or occupational group, some members may be grasping or more interested in their own <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than that of their patients, but in my experience there are very few of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, greater emphasis will be placed on English language training and both the migrant education and the migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in Australia will be expanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is placing increasing emphasis on migrant counselling and selection, and also on English language training and migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the hostels is, rightly, to provide services to assist new arrivals to settle into the community with the minimum of heartbreak and in the quickest possible time, to provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to assist them with their problems of education and social services, to provide housing advisory officers and employment services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under Labor’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing scheme, if a person wanted to build a castle he would receive much more assistance than if he wanted to build a normal dwelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effective development of Australia’s natural resources of minerals, forests, water and energy is, I believe, of crucial importance to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this initial period of  6  months, assistance is  a  State matter and is also closely related to child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> responsibilities and functions which are solely  a  prerogative of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The competing demands of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health, education, housing come readily to mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I intend to address my remarks to that section of the estimates dealing with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that the present Government has a very scant regard for the Aboriginal people generally and places very little importance upon the urgent need for substantial improvement in their general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the Government has emerged so belatedly, in this pre-election period, with concern about Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, environmental matters and many other things, it will help to compound the efforts that have been made by the Australian Labor Party to make these real issues for the whole country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I call it a lack of planning because it has brought us the major problems of increased crime, vandalism, riots, aud an increase in alcoholism and drug addiction, an increase in emotional and mental disorders and an increase in unemployment, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dependency and poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government initiative is a tangible expression of its very real and proper concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These consultations revealed among other things, that child care which was beneficial to the child’s overall development was prohibitively costly for the large body of parents, and secondly, that the childminding arrangements that most parents could afford fell far short of the quality that was required in the interests of child <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Second, the Government’s initiative springs from its concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman)  has said that Australia should be concerned primarily with Australia’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that if we are not concerned with it nobody else will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is about time we measured our achievements in terms of people and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and not money and statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether the Northern Territory itself should handle Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or whether this should be a national responsibility handled directly by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My own personal view would be that the Commonwealth should have control at all times over the future <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see this happen in Queensland and in all States of the Commonwealth because I believe that this would be the best way in which the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines would be looked after from a national point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly this is often the result of the activities of left wing socialists and communist union leaders who have little regard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people they represent or the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The damage that could be caused to :he people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was demonstrated very strongly in the recent petrol strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here again we find this problem of industrial disputes causing great hardship, because in that area the wheat harvest, which is very necessary to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people in the wheat industry, is just commencing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have the situation now - I am not saying that it is wrong - that the wife of an employee aged over 60 years who is dragging in $100 a week becomes entitled to a form of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that the Parliament and the Government will take notice of the recommendations that to proceed any further on the site would virtually involve discarding important town planning principles which will have a very great bearing on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 projects which we are asked to approve tonight, in addition to a number of other projects for the Northern territory, indicate the interest of the Commonwealth Government in the promotion and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite what the Opposition has been saying over recent months, the Government has been interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are talking about the threat from man-made fibres running counter to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the wool industry because we now might be pricing ourselves out of the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation subordinates the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of wool growers to those who thrive on what we call the free enterprise system of marketing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has a record of selling out the interests and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian wool grower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing the members of the Country Party as I do it did not surprise me that they were prepared to ignore the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the wool growers in favour of retaining their comfortable seats in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is in fact a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme of a certain kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are becoming unviable, so we are talking in terms of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposition essentially to get these people into a reasonable operation of one kind or another or, for that matter, as far as fruit growing is concerned, into non-operation if that is in fact their alternative, to get out of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government’s decision, uneconomic as it seems to be, to go into an area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision in relation to the fruit-growing industry is probably well taken because the omens are not very hopeful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the fourth measure that I have been privileged to introduce during the current session of Parliament as part of the Government’s far-reaching programme for the purpose of improving the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These organisations, honourable members will no doubt agree, play an important role in looking after the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged or invalid people in their own homes, not only by ensuring that they obtain adequate meals for a nominal charge, but also by providing a necessary contact between people who may be frail and lonely and supportive services such as home nursing, paramedical, housekeeping, emergency transport, shopping, gardening, hairdressing, chiropody, library and general counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of today’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure this is not a major item, but the importance of adequate nutrition to elderly people living alone cannot be overstated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I told the House when introducing the Aged Persons Homes Bill recently, one of the most important aspects of this year’s comprehensive programme to improve the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged people is to encourage and assist people who might otherwise be admitted prematurely or unnecessarily to nursing homes or other similar institutions to remain in their domestic environment for as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australians, as a whole, will see the response of these corporations as a real test of how much they are concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and stability of Australia’s economy, and of the Australian community.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-53-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is no provision for a clearance to be given, does it follow that Commonwealth <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and others will not be able to give evidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of sustaining a permanently deprived and depressed economy in future years would be immensely greater in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> terms than the assistance which should now be given for essential shipping services to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are being asked to believe that the Country Party is not just a mouthpiece of the big grazing and farming interests but has always been concerned with the health, education, housing and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians and is dedicated to solving the growing problems of the environment, namely urban congestion pollution, conservation and decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no quarrel with the text of this letter; it does make the best of a pretty poor case and it is as sympathetic as a letter about a harsh aspect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This, of course, is not a problem exclusive to repatriation pensioners; it affects all social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> pensions near the margins of permissible assessed income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This matter comes within the scope of this debate because it is the Department of Social Services which is charged with the task of looking after the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund from which these benefits come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know this so well because they, together with the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the Methodist missions, and also the Church of England <span class="highlight">welfare</span> associations, are the organisations to which these people must go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If she were over 50 years of age she could qualify for a B class widow’s pension, but the ludicrous situation is that the B class pension is less than what would be paid to her in child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that if we were to be as diligent and spend so much money on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those people better results would be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think we should do a ‘ number of things to enlarge the provision of health <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in a way which will absorb or eat up the enormous amount of accumulated reserves which these funds have, and quite unreasonably have, given the fact that the money has been contributed for the provi sion of health services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed scheme is concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children, with particular emphasis on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those children in special need of alternative care while their parents are working, sick or otherwise unable to care for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like it noted that I have made the following speeches on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>: On 5th March 1970 in my maiden speech; on 12th March 1970 on Aborigines; on 3rd June 1970 on handicapped children; on 17th September 1970 on the Social Services Bill in relation to pensioner poverty; on 22nd October 1970 on Aboriginal advancement; on 1st April 1971 on the Social Services Bill; on 15th <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also asked 4 questions concerning <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters on 30th October 1970, 6th May 1970, 9th December 1971 and 17th October 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the South Australian Premier write to the Prime Minister on 27th September 1972 in connection with the Alice Springs-Tarcoola railway, agreeing to a grant of Crown land for the railway without reservations concerning mineral rights and requesting the Commonwealth to keep the existing line from Port Augusta to Marree open whilst necessary for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the State of South Australia, subject to arbitration if a dispute arose as to economic viability? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, ‘ will he, when addressing the assembly, justify his Department’s consistent refusal to feed certain categories of deserted wives and their children or, alternatively, explain ‘ why he refuses to ascertain from the New South Wales Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department why that Department refuses to succour deserted wives at least to the extent provided by law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we ought to do is to see that all the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities of the Repatriation Department and the facilities of the War Service Homes Division are made available for people who are already serving, and they should be made available at least to those who have received an honourable discharge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering the question of fringe benefits availability, it must be remembered that the War Widow’s pension is free of all means test, whereas <span class="highlight">welfare</span> pensions at comparable levels are subject to the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-70-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first sittings you will be asked to give priority to legislation affecting the immediate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people, and to matters in which my advisers believe delay would mean damage to the nation or unwarranted neglect of the people’s wishes and mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Determined as they are to maintain strong defence forces, my advisers are deeply aware that the basic strength and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation depends on Australia’s ability to develop the skills and talents of her people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will insist, however, that the over-riding consideration must be the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the patient and are determined that the mandate given to them will be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants to Australia will receive the closest attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The emphasis of my Government’s immigration policy will be on the reunion of families and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government believes that measures to improve the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of deprived sections of the Australian community, or to promote equality within the whole community, however far-reaching and valuable in themselves, will ultimately fail unless basic and urgent attention is directed to the places where the people live and must live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from Tom Burke’s political work he was active in many fields of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and, in particular, played a major part in, and for many years was the guiding light of the slow learning children’s group of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A working party of top social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> administrators and other experts has been appointed by this Government to investigate and report on a suitable programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social security measures outlined in the Governor-General’s Speech quite correctly emphasise the urgency of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures represent the basic steps in the development of a national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy, freed of discrimination by sex, age or economic condition - a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programme which is a real response to our national conscience and which should be a basic condition in any civilised community that has a respect for its own citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy should provide a dignified way of life for the minority groups in our community which cannot contribute to the economic processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given this national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy, it is essential then to provide a flexibility and a mobility in our labour force which gives our people the maximum opportunity to express themselves and the maximum opportunity for the nation to benefit from their skills and intelligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of focusing political debate on the purpose for which we should use our resources for the community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> we find people concentrating on the use of resources to satisfy short-term political pressures or concentrating on the details of management, for instance by asking where the money is coming from instead of asking whether the priorities are right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is a government that has a concern for the creation of wealth, this country will not have the resources to meet the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the compassionate and the developmental requirements which we all would want to see met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s Speech concentrated on what the Government proposes to do for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the great cities and one decentralised city area, namely, Albury-Wodonga, lt mentioned nothing of what the Government proposes to do for general decentralisation throughout Australia in a sense that will achieve a real decentralisation of effort and initiative throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a basic reform of the Australian Education system, the development of a schools commission and a pre-schools commission, the abolition of university fees, the overhaul of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, the introduction of a universal health insurance system, the establishment of a school dental service, the establishment of Aboriginal land rights and the setting up of a cities commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is building up in the minds of the people of this country a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ethic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  President  Nixon was quite right when he told the Americans during his campaign: ‘We need to build in this country a work ethic, not a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ethic’ The Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  told us that he sat alongside  Mr McGovern,  the Presidential candidate, when he flew from London to Washington. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>whole campaign was built on cutting down the sinews and muscle of America’s defence system and building up a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ethic so that everybody gets something for nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He instilled in their minds the need to build up what I have called and what he previously called, a work ethic - not a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ethic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, there is community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as well and that means the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the man in the street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: What will he do about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the men in the street? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a lot to be done for Aborigines but there are a lot of other people living up there as well and we should also see about their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any government which does not seek to inform itself as fully as possible in areas affecting the nation’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is obviously decreasing its chances or possibilities of acting in the most effective manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all the major questions facing this nation - fiscal matters, international matters and matters of great concern on the domestic front such as housing, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - the Parliament has wasted more than an hour this afternoon discussing this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is iniquitous is that a system of taxation, devised for limited means, is now expected to finance, on an equalityofquality basis, social, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs for everyone from all areas, irrespective of their capacity to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, in real terms the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who do not belong to unions often depends upon the action of trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We seek to understand : and recognise that the gross national product is not necessarily an accurate measure of how much the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community is improving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are some of the factors that ought to be considered in relation to our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because they show inconsistencies and, despite the plea of concern for patients, reveal what the true attitudes are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The programme set out in the Governor-General’s Speech provides for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits which will bring some dignity to many longforgotten sections of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been somewhat troubled in recent years when the Leader of the Opposition - now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  - made it clear that he believed it to be of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia that Papua New Guinea should become an independent country as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have, under the umbrella of our powerful friends, been able to create a society which has developed at an enormous rate - a society which has been prosperous and within which the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the average family is as well developed as can be found in any country on this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed inconceivable to me at the time that any government could so lightly regard the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of hundreds of thousands of human beings as to use their suffering as a means of righting their own economic misadventures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After being the Minister responsible for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for nearly 5 years and having failed to abolish the means test he now proposes to move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Speech lists very important matters such as social security which will affect the basic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters the mark of a good, just, and great society is the way in which that society treats those of its members who are less fortunate than the average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has a close association with hospitalisation, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and handicapped people, 1 will be a very keen critic of any change in policy in this field, and again will welcome on behalf of these unfortunate people the assistance that has been promised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new Parliament, the old and new members, have the huge burden in all issues of national responsibility from defence, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to education in plotting the course for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system must be further expanded to meet all areas of need while not creating a bigger problem where people can and do live in the city whereby initiative is sapped and productivity is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Political expediency is the real danger in developing satisfactory and successful social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the sitting was suspended I was pointing out that our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system must be further expanded if we are to meet all areas of need in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is born of the relationship between electors and their representatives, the availability of representation, the flow of information and ideas, and response in understanding the interests of the people and relating them to the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such differentials have no place in a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system which is based on compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will result in a lower price level than would otherwise apply and in increased economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for the ordinary people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was particularly pleased to hear the Governor-General say that the overriding consideration must be the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both these fields, one cannot but be concerned at those directions which are rather depressing in their familiarity and rather outrageous in their neglect of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am greatly honoured and, in gladly assuming the responsibility, I would like to say that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of every person within the electorate shall at all times be my total concern and care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth main purpose is to correct an existing anomaly in the war service homes legislation by providing for the extension of eligibility to certain persons who served overseas with the Australian forces in the 1939-45 War or in the subsequent war-like operations as an accredited representative of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we consider that there is a strong case on the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds for exempting female persons with qualifying service under the Act from this requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed extension of benefits to members of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations who served overseas with the Forces will correct an injustice which has been allowed to exist for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1939-45 War representatives of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations served in such areas as North Africa, Greece, Crete, Papua, New Guinea, Malaya and Singapore and there were many casualties including some who died on service or became prisoners of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enactment of this legislation will ensure that the scheme will go on making its important contribution to the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by enabling eligible persons in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain a home of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore call on members of the Opposition to sheath their sabres, forget for a while their profound interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of multi-national corporations, get their heads from under the haystacks, and reflect on the plight of the human beings who are recipients of pensions outlined in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years I have been a trade unionist and trade union official, and my years of experience in the industrial sphere of this country have demonstrated to me that the present <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, after deteriorating throughout 23 years of Liberal mismanagement, is now a crumbling, fragmented and socially unjust patchwork offering no real social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the new Australian Labor Government I am pleased to have the opportunity of cementing the first brick in the foundation of a social security structure which will put the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community on a rational, socially-just basis and, for the first time since the last Labor government, offer some hope to the working man and his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the trends in this Bill, together with statements made by the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  are leading us towards the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state and do concern the Australian Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is economic responsibility and the other is the creation of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures announced in the Labor Parry’s policy speech show a complete lack of financial responsibility and indicate that in the long run the interests of the average hard working taxpayer will suffer from having to support the cost of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any responsible person think that the payout on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, involving as it does about one-fifth of the total Budget, can be disregarded when the financial aspects of Australia’s annual Budget are being considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way - to come more directly to the present Bill - we have to understand that in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> we now have an altogether different starting point on which to base our judgment of future programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past: - as any review of Hansard will confirm - our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> debates dealt very fully with all manner of things but very little with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at the record of the past 23 years and try to extract what the then Government saw as its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> philosophy - its long term aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if any social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aim at all could be found in the Liberal Government it was the aim to keep social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending to a minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to agree - as most people probably now do - that money payments alone are not the beginning and end of a decent <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely for this reason that the present Bill is important not only for what it provides, but for what it represents - the first step towards a long term commitment to reasonable money payments for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same thing can be said about the so-called poverty line around which so much social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> discussion has centred in the last 5 or 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity and indeed the challenge will then be faced of tackling questions of greater complexity, such as how to integrate cash benefits with community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and health services, housing policies and education programs, to mention just a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other  respects,  a re-allocation of existing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure could well be helpful - for example, from tax deductibility for dependent children to increased, child endowment, or from the current housing component of pension requirements to an accelerated program of pensioner housing construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it will probably mean is the introduction in Australia of specific social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> contributions to finance the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they must not be allowed to obscure what will be far more generally true, namely that the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program which this Bill sets in motion will be regarded by Australians of the future as needed as much for our self-respect as for our comfort, as long overdue and certainly as irreversible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education of our children and the needs of young families must be of primary importance in establishing pur priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the principles and standards by which we in the Opposition will judge the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation brought forward by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition charges are made for rubbish removal, for the attendance of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sister and for a community centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads me to the general principle, but a false belief, adopted by some people that, because a country devotes a certain percentage of its gross national product to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, the people of that country are better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a distinction must be drawn between a person’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in absolute terms and a person’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in relative terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that if a high percentage of a country’s GNP is devoted to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in relative terms it could be said that those people are better off than are other people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if, because of the overall financial policies of the government of a country, that country stagnates and real improvements in standards of living and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> do not proceed as promised or as hoped, the actual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those people in absolute terms is slipping behind all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the comparison was made that the people who were complaining - industrial workers, particularly in the Los Angeles area - in absolute terms were far better off and were achieving an improvement in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> at a faster rate than were the average workers in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that it is important to have relative <span class="highlight">welfare</span> within a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this cannot be achieved with complete disregard for absolute <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and for overall improvements in standards of living in a country which the policy of any government can effectively ruin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this story illustrates the difference between absolute improvements in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and relative improvements in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States who was making the point that an American worker was better off than his British counterpart because America believed in absolute improvements in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be careful also that in some areas our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are just to all in the community and that the penalties we impose on certain sections of our society do not outweigh the justice we are doing to others or, put another way, that we do not give to one section on the one hand and take away from another section on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to remember and this would worry me very much if it happened - that unless we take into account all these aspects when considering an overall social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy the same thing could happen here as is happening in at least one other country, at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There a backlash has developed against social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which is now acting to the detriment of those who deserve and need social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many other aspects with regard to the whole field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to which I would have liked an opportunity to have addressed some remarks, but the ambit of this Bill is limited to the proposals contained in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the increase in pensions and the opportunity to speak on the Social Services Bill because it allows me to emphasise the Opposition’s recognition of the importance of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, in fact, a matter of public record that the most effective and farreaching social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives introduced in Australia have been the result of LiberalCountry Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of the Government is yet to be established but it should note that the Opposition parties will be carefully analysing its initiatives and proposals in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the wealth-producing industries are capable of surviving profitably, the essential social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies that have been announced by this Government - the grand dream of the Labor Party for this grand society - will go by the board because the finances to support the objective will not be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter will be dealt with as soon as the national commission on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is established and this should be announced quite soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was agreed that the Commonwealth pay money to the States, to be allocated through the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments to provide some assistance to women with children born Outside marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the people in receipt of increased payments will be very delighted  -  I shall deal with that matter in detail later - but their feelings of pleasure could easily be dampened by the overall effect on costs, prices and general productivity caused by the Labor Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, they are concerned not only about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies of the Labor Government but also about its defence and security policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy speech delivered by the then Leader of the Opposition in the recent Federal election campaign stated that a Labor Government would be prepared to take the financial aspects of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> out of budgetary considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a completely irresponsible and even dishonest approach for the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to claim that his Government will ignore the financial considerations of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in the national Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government will revolutionise the community’s approach to the problems of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, particularly the problems of the aged, the sick, the handicapped, the retarded and the migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the most enlightened and equal approach to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> can only scratch the surface of the basic problems of equality and wellbeing of most of our citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first sittings you will be asked to give priority to legislation affecting the immediate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people, and to matters in which my advisers believe delay would mean damage to the nation or unwarranted neglect of the peoples wishes and mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today we legislate to improve the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> nothing significant has been achieved in the 23 years the previous Government held office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was neglected by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with adjustment assistance, the Government has laid down such stringent criteria that it will be virtually impossible for any industry, except the fruit industry, to qualify and that is virtually a once only <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government recognises the very important aspect of the principle of identifying the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inquiries have been set up into national superannuation, national compensation and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters so that a thorough review of these areas can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Throughout the 1972 election campaign and again in  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral’s address at the opening of this Parliament the present Government has strongly emphasised the needs of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and in this field possibly one of the greatest needs .s the need to provide adequate care for aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia as a whole, the Labor Party does not appear to agree with the Minister for Services and Property in regard to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice it to say that a critical area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has now been comprehensively examined and flowing from that examination decisive actions have been taken accordingly by a decisive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that has needed attention and it has now received that attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as primary production, the running of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country are concerned, they are in good hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has promised social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes and improvements in housing, urban development and transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, finally, the age at which it is appropriate for the country’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to call up young men or women could well vary; the military might decide that they needed them at 15 or at 20 or at 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are more interested in soft issues such as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the environment and even inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Naturally the Opposition welcomes the Minister’s desire to extend the range of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Opposition parties will be submitting positive and constructive proposals and we hope that those initiatives when put to the House will be seriously examined by the Minister in no sense on party political comment but in the context of what can best be done in this country for migrants and the extension of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the honourable gentleman does not really care about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of British migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent Swedish study reveals that children born after their mothers have been refused abortions were far more likely than other children to become members of broken families, inmates of public institutions and recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cost benefit studies which were carried out in 1972 by Political and Economic Planning for the British Family Planning Association established that averting the birth of an unwanted child saved in public health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services alone $1,350 in the case of a child born fourth in its family, $1,510 in the case of a child born fifth in its family and $8,728 in the case of the illegitimate child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present there is a very great shortage of trained professional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the future there will be professional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, workers whose services will be an ordinary, natural, normal addition to the services which will be available to people living in a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope these professional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers will be able to do what they can to relieve the pressures that build up which cannot be handled by some people in the complex industrial community that we live in today, and in which the complexity continues to grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people, I believe, under professional supervision by the professional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers and a local professionally qualified medical practitioner should involve themselves with advice on family planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Families who adopt children are screened by profes sional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers and in most cases are more adequately equipped for parenthood than the natural mother and father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that this matter is one in which the Parliament as a whole can make a real contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is a complex one which I do not wish to go into in detail at this time, but 1 believe that the measure to remove the sales tax on contraceptives, as proposed in the Bill, is only one of a wide variety of family support, counselling, education and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which this Parliament should consider and support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am opposed to the pill being on the free list and I would prefer to see these funds of $5m, or S8m from next year, allocated to family planning agencies rather than the present system of subsidising the use of the pill and other devices - and they are being subsidised - because family planning agencies provide counselling and advice across the whole range of family <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I want to make a plea for a broader national outlook with an earnest desire to promote the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all and attention to the social needs of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a community requires such amenities and necessities and their provision should not be based upon economics alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister and I attended a seminar on housing last year in Adelaide and a strong view was expressed at that time that perhaps the way to approach problems in the area of housing, particularly in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, is by making subsidies available to the individual tenant or home buyer rather than to the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last Budget the amount allocated to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> rose from $3 1.3m to $53.2m, an increase of approximately 70 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me return very briefly to the question of Aborigines deciding primarily the conduct of their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or future negotiations between themselves and the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those of us who have been interested in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will agree that it is not easy to get the more vociferous Aboriginal spokesmen to work within what might be termed the Public Service structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say  to the  Minister in all seriousness that one of the sources of major concern in Australia today is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the improvement of the lot of the Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past a lot of damage has been done by the very sincere efforts of the authorities - I refer particularly to the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch of the Northern Territory Administration - by pressure-cooking the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major portion of that increase, excluding unavoidable increases such as those caused by additional numbers of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiaries, is due to Government action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>  (Mr Hayden)  has stood up for the rights of long-haired youths to draw unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final consequences of this situation can only be the diminishing capacity of the economy to pay for higher real wages and the diminishing real benefits derived from social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not intend to depend on moral force alone, strong though that may be in the new context of a Government concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in this context the effect of interest rates on housing, which is a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Galbraith who, as I mentioned, is the apostle of the more modern theory I referred to, argues that Budget policies are similarly non-selective - at least as they are practised by non-Labor governments - that they are capable of selection, but in the areas of resource allocation and the setting of appropriate social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities these budgetary policies have been remiss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member well knows from his own association with and involvement in community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in his home area over many years, we must also provide services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proposing, I hope within a week or a fortnight at the most, to make an announcement of the people who will be manning a national commission on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the purpose of this commission which will be staffed from people of many disciplines, highly qualified in their fields, will be to identify long term objectives and to assist in the development of a rational framework of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which will hang together in a balanced, planned sort of way to provide for the evaluation of these programs so that we are continually aware of their relevance or of their need for improvement or redirection in certain areas as community needs and aspirations change from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter to which I want to draw the attention of the Goverment is an anomaly which recently was brought to my attention concerning the reason why many people suffer embarrassment in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mostly, these families are in the low income group, and are severely affected by the delays in workers compensation, insurance, Commonwealth sickness and unemployment benefits, and pensions, and worst of all by delays in initial payments of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Honourable Murray Byrne had the interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Portland that he pretended to have for the purposes of the election campaign, I would have thought that at least he would have replied to my letter to him dated 27th March, but not a word have 1 heard from the Honourable Murray Byrne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s accusation that the Government is not interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the workers at Evans Deakin shipyard is typical of the accusations he made during the last Parliament but, of course, then he was criticising his own Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill marks another instalment in the implementation of the Whitlam Government’s progressive policy in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area and will be followed by many other measures designed to ensure that we resume our rightful place as a pioneer and leader in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The in-depth evaluation of these sites which will involve also a study of offshore and inland concepts, will then go forward embracing, of course, all the technical needs of a new airport, the economic implication of the investment of money and resources needed, the implications in respect of the natural, cultural and social environments, and not least of all, the implications which this very large investment will have for the future development of Australia’s largest city and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I beg the Minister to examine this criticism, as it comes from a person who has had an active interest not only in the Northern Territory but also in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the committee system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are vital questions that should be considered by the Committee and for that reason, among many others, including the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people, I consider this as a vital matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> must be taken into consideration - the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of the north and of our original Australians, the Aborigines, who have a special claim for attention and consideration by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also looked at the 6 official members of the Legislative Council and, against the backdrop that it thought the Northern Territory should have a much greater degree of attention than it has been given before, the Government decided that rather than have the 6 official members from the Department of the Northern Territory, and as the new approach is specialisation with special attention being given to health, education and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, that each of those specialised departments should be represented on the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me, however, that he has relegated this problem of inflation, which is growing in this country, to that of a second class problem because he has made a number of statements, the gist of which is that the Government will not let inflation prevent it from getting on with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs that it thinks are important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with other measures, this Bill cannot be viewed in isolation; it cannot be divorced from overall budgetary considerations in spite of the Prime Minister’s extraordinary statement in his policy speech that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social security as a whole no longer would be subject to financial or budgetary considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nonetheless, I agree with the honourable member for Mackellar that there can always be a backlash in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social security programs if they seem to be too generous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always a core of conservative people in the community who resent strongly the provision of what they feel are too generous’ benefits or ‘too generous’ a system of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services being established in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member for Mackellar that Australia is a long way short of being too generous either in the provision of benefits or of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services or in the philosophy that motivates the development of these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is making the job of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  who is sitting at the table, far harder than it would otherwise be because this program endeavoured to paint a picture and excluded from the scene anyone who happened to be interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australian citizens whether they be Aborigines or anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could have easily asked one of the members of the committee, some of whom were Europeans, some part coloured, some cattlemen, some <span class="highlight">welfare</span> people, a cross section of the town of Katherine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not have time to go through them all but some of them were: The running of educational, health and job opportunity functions of the Department; the running of settlements at Hooker Creek, Beswick and Roper River - these places are in the local area and naturally enough the people would be interested in them; the allocation of funds to the Department and the way they are expended; the questioning of the lack of supervision of the spending of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cheques paid to Aborigines for specific purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But this reporter did not wish to portray this genuine interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people in the area, not only Aborigines but also whites on the settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If money is used excessively and unjustifiably in one area, we deprive other areas of need - education, other areas of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, community services, environmental factors and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar was Minister for Social Services and has taken a tremendous interest in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> over a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the Government gives this activity a greater priority than it gives to other areas of government responsibility that it should be attending to, such as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and helping the needy in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Requests for financial assistance which my Department receives from organisations or persons acting on behalf of migrants fall generally in 2 areas - those which relate to assistance in acquiring land or premises for the establishment of ethnic clubs and those which relate to funds to support the employment of persons engaged in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work in the migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has now moved a motion which, in effect, states that Australia should be solicitous of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens everywhere and at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill also extends benefits to accredited representatives of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations who served overseas with the Australian forces, either in World War II or in warlike operations since the last World War under conditions where their services would qualify them for benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems incredible,  Mr Speaker,  that to date representatives of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations such as the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Young Women’s Christian Association and the Australian Red Cross Society that served in all theatres of war with distinction, such as North Africa, Greece, Crete, Papua New Guinea, Malaya and Singapore, have not been recognised and given the opportunity to participate and have the same rights as a returned person under the War Service Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Returned men in this House will remember only too well the tremendous job done by the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations in all theatres of war where Australian troops were fighting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is estimated that 1,000 <span class="highlight">welfare</span> representatives of all categories served overseas during the Second World War, plus an estimated 100 who served in warlike operations since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill brings in representatives of certain <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, and I think that is quite proper too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson)  advised the Parliament in his second reading speech the Bill has four main purposes: Firstly, to make provision for the extension of the war service homes scheme to include those members of the forces who have completed a specified period of defence service; secondly, to make provision for an increase in the maximum loan under the scheme from $9,000 to $12,000; thirdly, to make provision for the granting of war service homes benefits to certain unmarried female persons with qualifying service under the Act; fourthly, to provide for the extension of eligibility to certain persons who served overseas with the Australian forces in the 1939-45 war, or in war-like operations subsequent to that war, as accredited representatives of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill not only gives belated justice to the women in this category, but also gives justice to those members of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations who served overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in this Bill will not only enable the scheme to continue making an important contribution to the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by assisting eligible persons and their families in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain homes but will also bring the privilege of these benefits and restore justice to many who were previously deprived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisations designated as accredited <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations are the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Australian Red Cross Society, the Campaigners for Christ and the Australian Forces Overseas Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase in graduates in social work will enable the staff of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments more effectively to regionalise their activities, as in most States they are presently attempting to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The exceptions are: the development and implementation of policies for the advancement and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> including education of the Aboriginal people in the Territory; land surveys; acquisition, leasing and management of land and property on behalf of the Australian Government and administrative servicing of the Northern Territory Police Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-42-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the members of the Commission have been chosen from various professional disciplines so that a wide range of professional expertise and experience could be brought to bear in considering social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the ordinary man or woman who may be a user of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, or dependent on pensions or other income support programmes, would also have a voice in the development of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government considered it more appropriate to invite the ACTU to nominate a member of the Commission, since union membership includes a great many potential or current consumers of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The truth is that all of the social workers trained by these various courses are all pretty well trained for their job, a job which is so necessary these days in the expansion of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and agencies involved in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These courses are usually at technical colleges as I know is the case in Tasmania, or within social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments such as the certificate courses run by the Victorian Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we have to look at the relative place of social workers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the time has come to make a fairly generally accepted decision about the type of course required for social workers, the sort of level al which they will operate on graduation and the relationship between social workers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers both in the work they do and in the relative numbers of each, and the relative numbers of each to be trained with governmental support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer qualification be used as a stepping stone to a later qualification as a social worker, if desired? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lack of co-ordination in this field can lead to a great inefficiency in the use of resources in training and in the employment of workers in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Too frequently, through shortage of qualified applicants, nonprofessional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> staff has to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the local level the social worker can provide that human contact which is so essential in any <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Close to the grass roots, they can mobilise the voluntary organisations already in existence, they can initiate new programs, and act as the pivot in the development of local social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> complexes which may well include <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, officers, youth co-ordinators, home help services, meals on wheels services and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Conversely, a program of financial assistance in the field of education to provide training facilities is a waste if social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> lacks vision and planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In rejecting these reasonable representations and this expression of United Nations opinion, by continuing atmospheric testing in the Pacific and by announcing that further tests are yet to be held, the Government of France has shown what I can only describe as an inexplicable disregard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, well being and the clearly expressed views of the people of Australia, the Pacific and the littoral states of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While it is to be recognised that these are possibilities and that the conclusions reached are subject to qualification, nevertheless, it should be selfevident that any pollution of the environment carrying with it the possibility of endangering human life and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, should be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He indicated further that there had been some problem in the sense that the Government, since it had taken office, was not showing the interest he would have expected in matters associated with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those using postal and telecommunication facilities in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition: Do they not think that the price of things that people have to pay for, legislation dealing with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the numerous Bills that we have before the Parliament are equally as important as this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final side of the triangle, as I see it, is the question of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - how the community supports those people who are less fortunate than others and how we tackle it at that level.I think it is appropriate to quote some of the clauses of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that single and married women are at times so threatened by the thought of bearing a child that their own <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - possibly the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a family- is seriously threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to confine one’s thinking to this single absolutist principle is to ignore the many other rights inherent in the situation, such as the rights to health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the mother and her existing family, the rights to choose whether to bear children or not and the right of the child to be wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It attempts to deal with a question of major social importance - a matter with a wide range of associated questions of medicine, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the physical and mental health of mothers, basic human rights, and the rights and freedoms of doctors, nurses and hospital staffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that an attempt has been made to associate my name with calls for such an inquiry, when in fact I spoke some week or so ago about a study of expectant mothers’ economic and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, after all, the duty of this national Parliament and its members to determine an issue in which civil rights and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the mother are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this campaign for abortion has proceeded, it is notable that concern for child endowment, maternity <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, reduction of neo-natal, infant and child mortality of Aborigines have all been played off the stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such concern would be to find why people are pressured towards abortion; how unwed mothers might have proper care and hospital attention to give natural birth to their children; the procedures of adoption; the provision of government subsidised day care and after school centres for children of working parents; payment of equal tax rebates for dependants, rather than the present system of concessional deductions; increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits for deserted and/ or unmarried mothers; removal of legislative discrimination and positive action to suppress social and commercial discrimination against unwed mothers, de facto wives and illegitimate children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Northern Territory these can mean the saving of Aboriginal child life, for children in such centres are seen by infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sisters and, as a consequence, their health problems are treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attitude is consistent when carried through to capital punishment, sex education, access to professional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, child care centres, community assistance programs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are numerous social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, economic and industrial problems that cry out for urgent remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly related to this Bill is the fact that the area is deprived of a great number of other community facilities such as roads, libraries, child care centres, recreational centres, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and all the facilities which are provided by local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, do his Government’s policies in favour of the big cities mean that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the small States which export much more than they import is to be sacrificed in favour of the most populous States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am worried that the Government, in taking this action, may be giving us a further indication of its lack of interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who live outside the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Statements by Ministers indicate that they are falling over each other in order to make plain their disregard for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of country people and their anxiety to put country people in their places and do great things for all the Labor voters in the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member, who has just resumed his seat, omitted to mention the fact that the truly remarkable achievement of the Minister, and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  who has worked so closely with him in matters of urban affairs, was to bring about that deathbed repentance of the previous Government over the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the cities of this country of which the National Urban and Regional Development Authority was the first and only expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inadequate education, health care, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and law enforcement as well as a deteriorating physical environment are the price of our having chosen to move so far so fast within such narrow confines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that for very many years it was believed that it was the responsibility of the Government to reduce or to eliminate freedom from fear and freedom from want and that consequently the pensioner should be entitled to have confidence in the fact that he would in moments of anguish and trial be assured of a base pension that would cover, first of all, the basic necessities and later on the conventional necessities such as housing, food and clothing, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and similar types of necessities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reply to the honourable member very specifically on one point, namely, that the Department of Immigration of the Australian Government is advised in the basic principle relating to this matter by the various State Departments of child <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement provides that, during each of the 5 years commencing in 1973-74, the Commonwealth will make advances at low rates of interest to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement therefore provides that not less than 20 per cent nor more than 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advances by the Commonwealth to a State in a year shall be paid into a home builders’ account to be lent to prospective home-owners through cooperative terminating housing societies or a lending authority of a State approved by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, at the request of a State Minister and in respect of a State in which its annual allocation to its home builders’ account in each of the 2 financial years ending on 30th June 1973 has exceeded 30 per cent of total new advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, the Commonwealth Minister may approve an advance to its home builders’ account in a year in excess of 30 per cent of the total Commonwealth advance in that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders’ account advances will be families consisting of a married or engaged couple, or a single parent or guardian with one or more children, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding child endowment payments, does not exceed about 93 per cent of average weekly earnings, plus $2 a week for each child beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coir intention is that our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advances will not be part of State programs approved by the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the process of negotiation of this Agreement, all State Housing Ministers sought certain assurances in respect to borrowing to be approved by the Loan Council and the minimum allocation for works, including any housing other than <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as the Government wishes to be in a position to offer the States advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing from 1st July next, it is important that the legislation to authorise it to enter into this Agreement, and make advances, be approved by the Parliament during the current sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to make advances totalling S84.6m to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing during the first 6 months of 1973-74. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total amount to be advanced to each State in 1973-74 for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing purposes, which is yet to be determined, will be the subject of an authorising Bill to be introduced into Parliament during the Budget sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As, under the agreement, it is proposed that the Commonwealth Minister will determine the amount of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advances to a State during the next 5 years, the Australian Government will be able to ensure that an increasing flow of finance will be available to the States to enable them to expand the construction of homes for needy persons and families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the permanent building societies have mushroomed far too fast for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of housing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Government and the honourable members here that whatever criticism they may like to make of resource allocation in this country - the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  talks of resource allocation with great frequency - and whatever new policies they think ought to be implemented, the wealth of this country today that they have to use to implement their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other policies was created under the climate of Liberal-Country Party governments which were in power, as the House knows, for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could be given a greater degree of flexibility, not only in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments but also in other developmental projects in which the State governments are unable to participate because they are beyond their capacity, and greater capacity to finance projects to which private enterprise cannot or will not commit itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is too serious a matter, but I will not see imperilled to the least extent the name of this nation, its integrity, or indeed the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its people because of the posturing of any State Premier or, indeed, the  president  of any political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are dealing not merely with the future of the lives of the people and their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and happiness; we are dealing with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of generations to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How ridiculous it is to suggest, as some of them have done, that States’ rights and the people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will be threatened if this Bill is passed by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are much more concerned with pre-schools and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, providing sufficient public open spaces and sports ground and community recreation facilities generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has a policy concerning the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped children but it is not always able to implement it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliamentarians, State and Federal, cannot jeopardise the public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by undermining each other’s efforts and duties for cheap political gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point, I would like to interpose and say that I am anxious to have all cash social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments made by the Commonwealth in an effort to reduce anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further discussions will take place at a meeting of Commonwealth and State <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ministers expected to be held in June next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the subject of the floor price, I believe that there ought to be, in settling this floor price, two separate components, namely, a commercial component which is the responsibility of the new Wool Corporation and based on commercial decisions and expectations alone and, if necessary, a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> component which should be the responsibility of this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">welfare</span> component in a commercial operation is a matter of political judgment which should be made in the political environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, all that has come out of this debate from the Opposition side is a clear certainty that what is really worrying Opposition members is not the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the rural industry and the people engaged in it, but the fact that the Government by its well planned, sympathetic and realistic policy on rural matters will further weaken the chances of the Opposition Parties of holding the seats that they now hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern has also been expressed by local <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers and a host of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the redistribution can contribute to social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> progress in municipal areas in terms of halls, libraries, swimming pools, community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres, the community nurse nursing service, the family planning centre and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A range of community and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services is now expected to be provided by local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has now entered the wider role of providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which is urgently needed in the Australain community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  made, in his ministerial capacity, direct subsidies available to his own local government area in the form of a subsidy to a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Warringah Shire Council was able to attract from the Commonwealth Government a part subsidy towards the salary of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My Department has been in correspondence with  Dr LeClair,  the  Deputy  Minister for Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in Canada, about this quotation which, incidentally, has been used by those bodies in Australia in reference to the Canadian health insurance program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a firm policy of the Government that the major aspects of expenditure in its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program must benefit people of relatively low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its efforts to help such groups, the Labor Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, as revealed to us so far, is getting to a stage where it is placing impossible burdens on the traditional base of society, the single income family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important also that we take steps to ensure that the standard of a living of a 2 parent family where, the mother, iu the interests of her children, stays at home to care for them, compares favourably with such a family where the mother, due to the age of her children, feels that she can go out to work without prejudice to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation recognises that we must reappraise many of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures to ensure that inherent in them are no side effects which will put impossible burdens upon the normal families in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we should direct attention to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My children would not have been taken to infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres, they would not have been able to find places in pre-school centres, there would have been no open space in which they could roam, no playing fields on which they could participate in team games, no libraries from which they could borrow books, no social workers to advise them and no youth clubs to enrich their recreation, if it had not been for local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measuring the criteria of particular municipalities against that bench mark will establish how much those municipalities have available for services and facilities such as libraries, road construction, pre-school education and infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and what advantage those municipalities are taking of the revenue sources available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government undertakes an impressive range of activities in the fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and cultural activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comparatively, the western suburbs are deprived in that they lack a great number of community services such as roads, libraries, child care centres, recreational centres and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the responsibilities for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work fall more heavily on the shoulders of local government, so the equity of rate collection becomes more distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The benefit principle of taxation is more appropriate for most local government services but is most inequitable for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which should be provided from community revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the grants recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission would he p to equalise the facilities available in richer and poorer, or highly or sparsely populated, local government areas and would provide a financial topping up for the expanding ro’e of local government into the non-traditional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This objective could well be realised as many local councils already co-operate on a regional basis for many services such as regional libraries, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and fire protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s foreign policy rests upon the belief that Australia, given her resources, her geographical position, her historical and cultural background and the character and aspirations of her people, is well placed to make a serious contribution to the preservation of peace and the promotion of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our neighbours, while at the same time and by the same path, promoting her own interests and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their efforts are principally directed towards generating more rapid economic growth, creating wider employment activities, maintaining and accelerating expansion of the agricultural sector, achieving more balanced regional development and greater diversification of the economic structure, and providing improved social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I share with him his concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Housing Agreement Bill is designed to obtain parliamentary approval for the Commonwealth to enter into agreement with each State so that the Commonwealth, for the next 5 years from 1 July 1973, will be able to make advances at low rates of interest for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is my intention to send a proposal to the National Commission on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and to ask it for a complete review of the basis on which the programs so far operated have been established and asking it to consider whether there are in fact better ways of providing such a program of accommodation for the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has also said that to relate assistance more closely to needs the annual determination of the amount to be allocated to the Housing Commission for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing could no longer be left entirely to the individual States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the purposes of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing or subsidised housing surely must be to provide housing for persons who have great difficulty in purchasing a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After consultation with the State Ministers on the requirements of the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, during which regard shall be taken, among other relevant matters, of the numbers seeking assistance, the cost of land and of dwelling construction and the capacity of the State to use advances, the Minister shall determine the amount to be advanced to the State in respect to the financial year as Housing Authority advances and as Home Builders’ Account advances in accordance with clause 9. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very structure of modern society with giant firms on the one hand and, on the other, big unions (and if the Government’s legislation fostering union amalgamation goes through, there will be still bigger unions) and with neither side necessarily or primarily concerned with the public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - this very structure of modern society makes government oversight of the economy and government intervention in the economy in some measure essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my statement to the press on 11 March 1973 I said that my Department would be seeking approval (from the Public Service Board) to appoint 48 multi lingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, some of whom it was proposed would work with migrant children in schools and between the schools and migrants’ homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention to make such appointments was first discussed however at a meeting with State education authorities on 12 January 1970, and there is reference to my Department’s intention to assess the need to extend its normal integration services, through the provision of interpreters and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to meet the requirements of the child migrant education program, in the Ministerial Statement made to Parliament on 23 April 1970 by the then Minister for Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the extraordinary situation that on the one hand the Government, by means of this measure, is spending money in providing these benefits- I do not know how much; the Minister did not put any cost on the proposals- but, on the other hand, in the interests of economy and in order to find money to finance the vast <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals which this Government has it is ruthlessly cutting back on defence expenditure as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We propose, in addition, to double the Australian Government’s present contribution towards the capital cost of senior citizens centres to $2 for every $ 1 contributed by a State Government or local governing body, and we will increase from one-half to two-thirds the Australian Government’s contribution towards the salaries of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers employed at such centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the finish it is the aggregate that is important and what this Budget does deliberately is to shift the balance in the direction of more public spending which will go on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health, housing and other sorts of things, and less on private spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I explained at the outset, in the context of the Government’s comprehensive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plans this Bill represents only a small interim measure, designed to maintain the value, in terms of purchasing power, of the assistance being given to aged persons hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, at the Premiers Conference Loan Council meeting new arrangements for financing the construction of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing were agreed upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ohe of the greatest difficulties in improving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments has been what was described in the Budget speech as the erosion of the tax base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This involves striking a proper balance between the demands of the public sector, which distributes social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, against the health of the private sector, which creates the means of financing public spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The competition can be between government and private expenditure, between wages and profits, between <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and productive resources or maybe between governments themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is dedicated to increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, but it does not realise that increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and better provision for the disadvantaged can come only from increased productive resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible merely to transfer resources from the productive sector to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> without destroying our capacity to meet national aspirations for the disadvantaged in the areas where compassion must be shown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe that growth is essential to quality of life in Australia, quality in the environment, quality in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and quality in compassion for those who need assistance and those who need help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth in fact results from policies that improve <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because if we want a better life we need greater resources in order to provide for that better life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget gives great emphasis to the areas of education, health, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing and community amenities, culture and recreation, Aboriginal advancement, sport, tourism, aid for States, transport and communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that although this would become a ghastly situation in the economy and although the dose of medicine would be very intense, it would be absolutely vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the economy that the medicine be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major increases in expenditure have been in the field of education and in the field of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether one examines the fields of health, housing, education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, conservation, urban development or repatriation, one will have little trouble detecting evidence of our ambition and aim to improve the lot of our people not just in material terms but in every way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the name of human <span class="highlight">welfare</span> this Budget contributes towards fundamental disequilibrium within the economy and not towards reformist or redistributive objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its range and size of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits fall far short of its election promises and the increased benefits do not keep pace with the erosion of real money values caused by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it quite clear that the Opposition welcomes the emphasis placed on education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and Aboriginal advancement but it is unfortunate that these concessions are acknowledged in the context of the erosion in the purchasing power of disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major requirement of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs this time is to protect those who suffer most from high rates of inflation and it is always the recipients of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> who suffer the most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients have not been the major beneficiaries of the huge increases in expenditure, the major quality of life issues have been neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  for an excellent document and an excellent program of social reform in a wide sphere of activity including health, education, urban transport, other urban problems, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and many other fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With those community health services, with heavy emphasis on preventive medicine and with rehabilitation we will make an important break with traditional medical practice in this country and I believe it will be a great breakthrough for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget will create a greatly increased demand for buildings particularly <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and school buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It found that of all levels of government, local government was least able to hit back so it thrust upon local government all sorts of social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, things for which local government is geared neither to administer nor to provide in terms of finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is next, and then there is health with an increase of $196m or 25 per cent more than was provided in 1972-73, followed by transport and communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government which really believes in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia is distributing the income of the nation in the places where it should be distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite know that pensioners and people who depend upon social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes in the country and the city and everywhere else today are receiving the benefits they were denied for so long by those who sit opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it is wrong to imagine that the community’s needs for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are simply met by providing better benefit payments to the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The community collectively and the people in it individually equally need a comprehensive and adequate system of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange and disappointing to find though that Australia, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has one of the most undeveloped systems of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gauging the performances of past Australian governments it is clear the promotion of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs was guided by a philosophy that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was for the deserving poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services should be available for all and the worth of those services should not be stigmatised by such class prejudiced and antiquated values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conveniently sited health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres providing a range of integrated services relevant to the community needs in which the centres are set up are as keenly sought by the middle class as the working class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our aim is the provision of a comprehensive range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services designed according to the carefully established needs of communities, developed in response to priorities largely set by local decision making procedures which involve the community served as well as agencies both official and unofficial and free of any taint of last century poor house <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assert firmly that the availability of adequate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems which can be brought into operation quickly in response to the needs of individuals or of whole communities, must be seen as a public right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we have appointed a Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission with  Mrs Marie  Coleman as  Chairman,  whose eminence in this field is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Commission is charged with the responsibility of assisting the Australian Government in setting long range objectives in the planning, development and operation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I have tabled the first report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the first discussion paper prepared by the Commission on the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the Australian Government aims at developing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services according to a new philosophy appropriate to the expectations and needs of contemporary Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system is to produce, through a range of social policies, a social environment in which every individual has the opportunity to develop his unique potential and in which various supports are offered to those individuals who, through some inherited or acquired disadvantage or handicap, need special assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, housing and education policies, policies concerning minimum acceptable income and taxation systems all have social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years the Australian Government’s policy towards personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services has been to treat them as worthy charitable ventures to be given some assistance by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has not been any recognition that personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, as well as income support, should be treated as a right or as social utilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this does not mean that the Australian Government will take over the provision of personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services may be provided by a range of organisations, including local government and State government authorities and the traditional nongovernment <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies, or by new groups such as groups of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service users. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has appointed a Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to advise on the development of integrated social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, and the first report of this Commission, I repeat, has been tabled today, together with the first discussion paper on the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the Australian Government have noted with interest the recent changes in personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service systems in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has committed itself to the concept of forward planning - planning of our cities, our health policies, our education policies and our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission has been allocated funds to carry out a program of careful evaluation of some demonstration programs before recommending on the final legislative form of the Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way it is hoped to produce some co-ordination of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs of State and Federal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission has appointed to its staff an officer widely experienced in community development programs in Canada and Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission plans to use a number of techniques such as film and video tape to make the details of the various demonstration programs available to groups of interested citizens across the entire world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is making arrangements with a number of academic institutions to carry out evaluations of the demonstration projects which will be established in the initial phase of the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will arrange for special training programs for staff to work in the regional councils for social development, as well as training in community development techniques for other personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the initial phase of the Australian Assistance Plan, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will itself determine, after consultation with the various State government authorities, State councils of social service and other appropriate bodies, which areas of Australia will be used for demonstration projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission has indicated that the final program could cost in the order of $30m a year once established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> commission is hoping, with the support of the members of this Parliament and the ordinary citizens of Australia, to find some innovative solutions to meet social needs which will involve the community in the meeting of those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 reports I have tabled in this Parliament today - the first annual report of the Australian Government Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and Discussion Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 on the Australian Assistance Plan prepared by that Commission - represent a major step forward in the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, reviewing the history of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in this country, I believe it can be fairly said that to date nothing as important, nothing that can equal the progress which this represents, has occurred in this country before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look forward to a fruitful response from the Australian community and from our fellow parliamentarians and this response will allow us to improve on the very valuable contribution that has already been made and will continue to be made by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Report of the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission - Ministerial Statement, 30 August 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system is to produce, through a range of social policies, a social environment in which every individual has the opportunity to develop his unique potential, and in which various supports are offered to those individuals who, through some inherited or acquired disadvantage or handicap, need special assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point is that the Commission is advocating a new look at social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer does the Government propose to look at social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> only in the context of dispensing charity to somebody who happens to be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They then will not participate in any social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and the whole thing is self defeating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is refreshing for a Labor Government and a Labor Minister to be saying that it is not the intention of the Government to take over all social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities and that they want to encourage voluntary community involvement, which, if I can be excused for having a small tilt of my own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a plea to the Minister and through him to the Commission that in involving voluntary organisations, there is an enormous number of amateurs who could be involved in assisting in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in most activities of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> there are great opportunities for the recruitment of such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Commission will give detailed attention to the development in other areas of social policy of an appreciation of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications of such matters as incomes policy, the taxation system, recreation, housing and immigration policy, urban development . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also believe, as the Commission believes, that it is desirable in the long term to establish a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system in which the services are planned and provided at the most decentralised level consistent with efficient administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can think of nothing worse than, in a certain region of a State the Commission not going into the matter thoroughly enough to determine whether the administration in the area is competent to administer this terribly complex and highly sensitive area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and the administration in that region collapsing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be bad for government, bad for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and, I am sure, is a responsibility which neither the Minister nor his Department wishes to undertake, that is, to have to organise and administer centrally every social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program in every region of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What makes it vital for this Commission to look at social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - this is why I find its whole philosophy, attitude and recommendations so refreshing and why I compliment the Minister for embracing them - is that we do live in a period of change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister referred to the social costs of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an approach based on economic rationality and the need for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The premises for such a policy also include: That get big or get out is inadequate as a policy for all farmers; that there is no once and for all size of farm business likely to ensure all time viability; that drought, flood and other natural disasters should attract realistic, not confused, financial assistance; that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of rural communities and towns must be accurately perceived in social terms separate from handouts; that society, through government, has the responsibility to ensure employment opportunities for every man to earn or to have a minimum income but not to guarantee every man security in the occupation of his choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the surface, the bounty had only marginally improved the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the small dairy man, when it is considered that the bounty has been a factor pushing up the price of land and other inputs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget provides for an increase of $340m in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits but it is not in fact a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget because its specific benefits will be largely offset by the effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lashes out wildly in all directions, making savage attacks on the industries that produce the financial resources on which all advances in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people must be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government must understand, and what the Australian people must understand, is that if this nation’s free enterprise foundations are weakened too much the whole structure of the community and all the Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other programs will be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one questions the good intentions of the Treasurer in rapidly expanding Government spending on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, education, health care and similar matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the way this Government is heading, in scrapping defence and putting emphasis on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, we will see the day when we will be as ill-prepared to defend ourselves or to honour our commitments as we were in 1939. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program of this Government is based largely on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly this is money which can be well spent because Aboriginal people in many areas have a need for advancement with respect to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget, $2 19m is made available to assist the States to provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to those people in  receipt of  social  security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>  benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous Government - and I take the figures from Hansard of 21 August 1973 - the amount actually spent on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits rose by $503.5m over the amount provided in the previous year whereas the estimated increase this year over the amount provided last year is only $339.5m - a very serious drop of some $64m or 33 per cent less than the increase provided last year over the preceding year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, through responsibly looking at the needs of the economy and the terrible neglect in the areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education by successive Liberal Party governments, wehave been able to provide for the Australian people and at the same time introduce a Budget that will allow the business of Australia to move along, that will allow our factories to run at peak production, with people at a peak level of employment, with the number of unfilled jobs as high as they ever have been and, at the same time, we have tried to do something creditable about the appalling 13 per cent level of inflation created by the former Government 12 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be adequate to enable our physically and mentally retarded, our aged, invalid, sick or widowed people to live in dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget dealing with the quality of life and with a great deal of public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, in one city in America, by using a computer in its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agency it was found that a woman who had been receiving social security payments for 15 years had never had a medical examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, I commend decisions on Aboriginal advancement, road safety, the increased subsidy to senior citizens centres and Meals on Wheels organisation and assistance to handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the previous Government would have liked to introduce such a grandiose budget - a budget to advance the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, standard of living, education and quality of life of the average Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are once more assuming our proper role as a leader in the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and as a responsible and forward looking member of the world economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Australian Capital Territory and to a lesser extent in the Northern Territory, the Australian Government has the power to act directly for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be increased expenditure on social, cultural and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will rise by 30 per cent from $518,000 last financial year to $649,000 this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and culture expenditure is up $166,9 15 or 15 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have budgeted for a record expenditure of more than $l92m this year - clear evidence of our concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and development of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improvements in social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, if not always parsimonious, under the previous Government often had a tinge of reluctance about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, we are doubling the contribution towards the capital cost of senior citizen centres and increasing by one-third the subsidy towards Meals on Wheels, back dated to the beginning of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another Bill in the series being introduced in this session to improve <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for elderly people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In broad terms the Principal Act provides three forms of assistance: Firstly, for home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance for aged people in their own homes; secondly, for the building of senior citizens’ centres; and thirdly, for the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers employed by, or in association with, senior citizens’ centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in accordance with one of the recommendations made in the First Annual Report of the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which I tabled in the House recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third provision of the Bill concerns assistance towards the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 10 of the principal Act provides that where a person is employed as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer of a senior citizens centre wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services by or in association with the centre, the Australian Government may pay an amount equal to one-half of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order further to encourage and assist the provision of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to which I have previously referred, the amending Bill increases the Australian Government’s subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of the salary paid to appropriate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could interpolate one final comment,  Mr Speaker,  I would like to acknowledge the representations 1 have received regarding the fact that this subsidy for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers is restricted under the terms of the Act to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers engaged wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unhappy about the fragmented arrangement where several departments each sponsor <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer to see the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which are at present being provided exclusively for elderly people expanded and made available for everybody in need of advice or assistance, irrespective of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This calls for the development of an integrated program of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, complementary to income support programs and the welfarerelated aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly a generously improved program compared to what has gone before but is only a stopgap measure pending the development of more comprehensive integrated and adequately planned measures to ensure that the aged and indeed every other section in the community have easy access to a comprehensive range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat, this is the purpose of the Australian assistance plan which is undeniably the most significant step taken in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the honourable member for the Northern Territory on his obvious concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Darwin and the very soundly based thoughts that he brought to bear on this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that country people do not share in the benefits of improved social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or the benefits flowing from our contributions to housing and health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the few moments left to me 1 want to look at the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a doubling of the amount provided for senior citizens’ and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds are available under the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance plan and it is possible to get a grant of $20,000 for a regional director and planning staff to draw together the myriad social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health activities which are now run by so many different government agencies without any over all planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, a balance is always needed and advances must continue to be made in fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education but if the source of these advances, the growth and wealth producing areas of our economy, are restricted or hamstrung and if the scourge of inflation is allowed to race on unimpeded, the Government will end up robbing the very people it makes a sham and a pretence of representing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> have been given top priority in the Budget, as they should be in any Budget, and while this is not the place to debate fully these 2 vital areas of government responsibility, I commend the government for many of the measures undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the first objective is rapidly to expand the public sector both by direct spending and transfer payments, increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social service benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I stress again that the Government wants to enlarge the public sector by spending up on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, city development and the rest, and  Mr Clyde  Cameron, together with, the broad mass of the electorate in a perfectly legitimate way, wants higher incomes and more money for the goods and services they choose to acquire; in short, they want more real private spending power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the numerous advances in the field of health care and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provided for is the amount of $7,675,000 in grants for the school dental scheme in 1973-74. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reject any suggestion that less could be spent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who rely on pensions and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments would not survive if their payments were reduced or were not increased with increased living costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the provision, adequacy and viability of pregnancy support services, adoption services, counselling and other forms of assistance for families, mothers and mothers-to-be, given the social, economic, medical and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems in which they may find themselves involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are faced by a rising tide of human misery for which our present social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and law enforcement agencies can provide no remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the present Government came into office on 2 December it has provided grants of $225,000 for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, $125,000 for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, $200,000 for the Family Planning Association of Australia and $100,000 for the National Catholic <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee of Australia which will be repeated as an annual commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This inquiry like the royal commission for which I moved in May is not concerned with abortion in particular but with responsible sexual behaviour, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children and their parents and the shortcomings in fertility control of which abortion is one aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The problems of working mothers, of single parent families and the need for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> support are all highly relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these women need help, we should give it to them; if the babies require medical, social or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance, they are entitled to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The membership should consist of three - a mother experienced in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, a medical practitioner and a criminologist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioners should have access to the records of all Federal authorities, including health, social security, matrimonial causes and income tax authorities, and should have power to seek the cooperation of the respective State authorities in these jurisdictions, including the State law enforcement and child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies; as far as practicable, the commissioners should comprise a mother who is experienced in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work, a medical practitioner and a criminologist; and the commissioners should be assisted by senior counsel and have power to sit in camera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps one day the principle will be extended to repatriation so that no longer from a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> point of view will there be the costly and sometimes unfair situation which now prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a respect for the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  for what he has done in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commission on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> headed by that distinguished social worker,  Mrs Marie  Coleman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pensions and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are relative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly pension figure tells only half the story of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without meaning in any way to be argumentative but simply putting it as a fact as I see it, I think it is true to say that the last Government would have divided the provisions contained in this single Bill into at least six or seven separate Bills so as to squeeze out the last drop of public approval and political advantage to which social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures lend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, it is recognised that a responsible <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system cannot be based on some simple view that more of everything for everybody will solve all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have in my hand, to illustrate that it is no dis covery at all, a paper presented to the very first meeting of the Health and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee of the Labor Caucus held after the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view a proper order of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities should give greater emphasis to pension levels than to means test abolition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime let me simply say that this Bill is to be welcomed as a further step in the direction of a decent and comprehensive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pension increases continue to depend upon political and financial factors rather than on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also in the Bill the extension of benefits to members of the regular forces, and there is an indication of the interlocking of repatriation benefits with general health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only assume that this matter of interlocking repatriation services with other health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services gave rise to that rumour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is considerable expertise in the Repatriation Department which has much to add to community health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, and I do not .think those with that expertise should be prevented from giving that assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very fact of having an artificial limb enabled this man to carry out his normal everyday occupation and therefore he was not claiming any social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The RSL is concerned at a spate of rumours drifting round the corridors of power that the Repatriation Department may be absorbed into a Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> complex, and Repatriation hospitals transferred to either Commonwealth or State control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand the Government is being berated for being a spendthrift government and for causing inflation by the mammoth amount of money it is spending on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - <span class="highlight">welfare</span> includes ex-servicemen in particular - and on the other hand the Opposition is asking the Government why it does not spend more still. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are castigated often as not being interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one fell swoop the Federal Treasurer cleared the decks, as he put it, to initiate Labor’s great <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and at the same time he put the kiss of death on every Union journal in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is in the registered publications section, which affects newspapers and periodicals, that the biggest slug will come because the abolition of the various categories over 3 years will seriously affect all publications from charitable, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and religious organisations as well as from scientific, educational and technical organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let it not forget that it is profit that will finance all its geat schemes for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because it is the private sector which generates the wealth on which the public sector relies for its growth and the funding of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aged, sick and infirm who rely on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are being denied the right to eat the food of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that prices have been allowed to set the pace has created great hardship for those who rely on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and fixed incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its attitude on this occasion indicates that its words have had but a hollow ring, that me quality of life as judged by the Labor Party is something that is measured more by the capacity of a particular area to produce votes and win seats in this House than by a concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) As the honourable gentleman will be aware, the Government has determined that new <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives should be sponsored under the umbrella of the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The multi-purpose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres originally proposed for Sydney and Melbourne were envisaged as being of a pilot nature, and would have provided one means of experimenting with ways of rationalising local services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will be examining a great number of proposals for assistance under the Plan and will carefully consider the need for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres in relation to other proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House should proceed to discuss what is after all the first consideration of any Government - the security and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 3 April 1973 I announced that Cabinet had that day approved the establishment of a Commission on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> to make recommendations to the Government on the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need  for setting up the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is based on the new emphasis we have given to the recognition of adequate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems as being a public right which contributes to the well-being of the total Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new philosophy demands a change of emphasis in government policy and in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the new dignity which such a philosophy gives to the recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, it is the role of the Commission to evolve strategies which will enable those people in the problem - situation to take part in the planning of immediate objective and long-term goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover it is the role of the Commission to monitor existing programs, institute research projects, conduct public consultations and to ensure that those who use the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are involved in the evaluation of the relevance of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs to their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In developing new goals, implementing long term planning and setting priorities in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, the Commission is charged with the task of taking an overall view of social policy, which encompasses such areas as education, housing, health services, emplovment policies and other matters, as well as the more specific issues of income-security payments and personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept and role of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is a most exciting one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future there will be a rational development of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Assistance Plan is fully operational - the Commission is drafting the plan and will test pilot programs and evaluate the need for alternative and supplemental measures - the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of Australia will be released from the heavy hand of centralism which defined programs in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would assert quite firmly that the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in this country to date has been blighted by the way in which past governments as a matter of centralised decision-making determined priorities^ - and not many priorites at that either - and then by implication indicated to the community that if areas were either unsuitable or had no need for these particular programs that was tough luck; they missed out altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly the response to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of these regions has been inadequate and often irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also mention that when the Australian Assistance Plan - now being developed by the Government - is fully operational, community based voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services will be fostered and stimulated with generous sup- port so that the services provided and the organisations providing them are related to, and are identified with, the community in which they operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only display of centralism in this exercise is the display of responsible decision-making by the Australian Government which has established the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and which in turn directed the Commission to develop the Australian Assistance Plan according to guidelines set down by the Government in order that the administration and operation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and key decisionmaking affecting their direction are very much a local community concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such other functions in connection with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs as the Minister approves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the Australian Assistance Plan is to assist in the development at a regional level, within a nationally co-ordinated framework, of integrated patterns of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, complementary to income support programs and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 prepared by the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which I tabled in the House on- 30 August 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These public reports will serve as a standard by which the Australian people will be able to judge the Government’s performance in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area having regard to the information provided and the recommendations made to it in the Commission’s reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is a further demonstration of the Government’s commitment to introduce democratic participation into national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are confident that the work of the Commission - which will facilitate informed public discussion of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs and priorities - will be invaluable in devising new policies and the establishment of a better social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer  -(Mr Crean)  to make advances not exceeding $327.975m to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing during 1973-74 and the first 6 months of 1974-75, in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>65m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing by the States for 1973-74, to be distributed among the States as shown in the first column of the schedule to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>65m to be advanced to the States in 1973-74 represents an increase of 26 per cent on the amount spent by the States on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because advances to a State for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing cannot be made until the Agreement is ratified by the State Parliament, funds for this purpose are being provided by way of advances supplementary to the advances made for works purposes under the approved Loan Council program, until such time as the authorising legislation has become effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, therefore, contains a provision authorising the Treasurer, with the concurrence of the State, to deem any such advances made against a State’s loan program for 1973-74 to have been advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let the Opposition’s mates, the people like the friends of the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner),  be put aside because what counts here is the people of Australia, not Woodside Burmah, not a particular company, not interstate rivalries, not inter-party rivalries, but the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with the problem of trying to promote their own ideas against the views of a population which is so centralised in the south-eastern portion of the nation, the States must naturally be most careful not to give away any of the powers that they hold that affect the promotion of their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can see, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child is of paramount importance but we must make sure that this sort of thing does not happen again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the honourable member said: Let the rest of the community look after them; fix it up with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments or let them go without; do not worry about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed in the honourable member’s speech on the second reading he has shown the reasons why, in broad outline, the Opposition is opposing various measures where it is felt that these will inhibit the role of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its conciliation and arbitration functions and inhibit the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of individual unionists and the employer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have long been aware of the valuable contributions of ICEM to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of thousands of persons who have been displaced over the years, and I wish to thank Member Governments for their active support for the important humanitarian contributions of ICEM. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for Immigration inform the House what measures are being taken by the Government to overcome the drastic shortage of interpreters to assist migrants with little or no English in such matters as contracts, court cases and government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is my own view: First of all, the child’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said: ‘First of all, the child’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is paramount, but I cannot possibly be asked to solve that sort of question in this sort of situation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own position is such that I will take every possible step to ensure Nola’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human rights and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people themselves will be mv first concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such issues as fostering were left to the Northern Territory Administration and the Director of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such cases the Director of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> operated within the bounds of the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ordinance and in particular, part V of the Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proper course had been followed in regard to Nola’s case a children’s court would have granted an order under section 36 (1) (b) of the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ordinance, which would have placed the child under the care of the Director as in paragraph (i), or in the hands of the foster parents as in paragraph (ii). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the parents and indeed the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service which advises them could always apply to the same court to revoke an order under the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, was Nola Brown a child in respect of whom an order had been made under section 36 (1) (b) of the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ordinance committing her to the care of either the Director of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the Northern Territory or foster parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our real concern should be for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child and the right of the court to make a decision in such a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I query its capability to speak on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, seeing that virtually all of this committee was nominated by the Minister and drawn from the ranks of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, except for a few other reputable people, who, in the opinion of a number of people, were appointed for window dressing purposes only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that in order to avoid any queries regarding the Minister’s administration of his important office he should deal more openly with the public and advise them fully of his intentions and plans for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our Australian coloured people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable P. Howson, as the then Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, in a debate in Parliament on 14 September 1972 set out the number of organisations which had been set up to care for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when the investigation is carried out it will be found that the health situation of the child and the actual feelings of the parents for the child at the time were discussed between the foster parents and the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch as it then was, of the Northern Territory Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the committee which works with him are most anxious that the regional presence of the Australian Government should be established as quickly as possible in centres throughout Australia, that we should co-operate with those State agencies which are able to fulfil their function as an agent for the Commonwealth in a particular State, and so that we might be able to gain value from the expertise of the people who have served the States in the role of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers so that these people might be incorporated into the Australian Government organisations in order that we might benefit from the wealth of knowledge that they have available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other areas of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> about which the Government is gravely concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be very difficult to convince them that probably the best thing for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is for them to be located where we can provide these opportunities for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expenditure for this year for Aboriginal advancement is: Education, $4,600,000; health $9,il 34,000; social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, $3,230,000; housing and amenities, $14,786,000 - a total of $31,750,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisational structure of meals on wheels services may well be a particularly fine example of government and voluntary aid combining to provide an effective and extensive social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third provision in the State Grants Home Care Bill concerns assistance towards the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 10 of the principal Act provides that where a person is employed as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer of a senior citizens centre wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services by or in association with the centre, the Australian Government may pay an amount equal to one-half of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order further to encourage and assist the provision of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to which I have previously referred the amending Bill increases the Australian Government’s subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of the salary paid to appropriate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition thoroughly supports this legislation but as I said in my speech in response to his statement on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission I do invite the Minister’s Department to look at the employment of amateurs in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government realised that there were not enough paid social workers or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to cope with delinquent children and it handpicked with meticulous care adult citizens to act in a capacity of honorary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have someone fairly close to me who is an cutstanding <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, the Minister says that he is unhappy about the fragmented arrangement whereby several departments each sponsor <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Owing to the fragmented nature of our health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities, people needing assistance are often unable to locate the source and they wander through a bureaucratic maze of government, semigovernment and voluntary agencies, becoming more and more distressed as they fail to overcome their emotional or financial problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think many people outside those who are working in this field realise just how fragmented our society <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were to sell their homes for$15,000 or $20,000 and make a contribution by way of outright gift to an aged persons homes organisation to enable that organisation to build further accommodation, it would give them security in retirement, it would give them comfort in small modern self-contained accommodation; it would give them, as an increasing number of these orgainsations do, ongoing care in the event of their frailty or in the event of their sickness, and current care in the event of their immediate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard the organisational and administrative responsibilities accepted by these committees as being a most important contribution that they make to the scheme and to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the aged people who are residents under it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in his second reading speech, stated that a reassessment of the aged persons homes program is being undertaken at the moment by the National Commission on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and pending the receipt of the Commission’s report no major changes are contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with previous speakers that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers should accompany these voluntary workers and that the needs of these people should be catered for in other areas additional to the need for a meal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that since the beginning of this session he has introduced 3 most important social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 Bills before the House tonight are all concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that the increasing of the share of the salary subsidy for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had experience in my electorate of finding that because, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers are appointed by many departments, their communications are not as good as they should be and there has not been the support and the service given to the community which could result if we had great co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service and if the aged are in need in one area, surely that need is reflected in all other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may be the reason for the scarcity of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was appalled to find that the subsidy claimed by local government Authorities in Western Australia for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers was only S5.475 for the period from 1 July 1969 to 30 June 1973 and for home care aid for the same period $26,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to local voluntary and service bodies such as Apex, Lions, Rotary, the Country Women’s Association and many other such organisations which contribute manifestly to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the citizens within their sphere of influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Social Security seen a report of a statement by  Mr Justin  Fleming, the  President  of the Australian Association of Surgeons, in which he associated himself or expressed agreement of his association with the Liberal Party spokesman on health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the honourable member for Hotham, who had accused doctors’ organisations of deplorable taste in their attacks on the Federal Government’s proposed national health scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member referred to comments by the honourable member for Hotham, the spokesman for the Opposition on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the community will achieve superior health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services as a result of this sort of approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that all people who believe in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of every citizen in this country should vote for this proposal that is coming before the Parliament to deal with this matter urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a chance for honourable members opposite to be statesmen, to stand up and debate this issue today and to allow this Government to implement policies that will affect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all the people of this country and will safeguard their interests in every possible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the employment of more than 120 bi-lingual or multi-lingual officers; the recent appointment of 48 specially qualified multi- ‘ lingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, including 16 to work in the education field, and the provision of a telephone interpreter service in no fewer than 42 languages in Sydney and Melbourne and soon to be extended to other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would pay tribute to those non-governmental organisations and enterprises - in particular Good Neighbour Councils, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations throughout the community, national groups, and bank migrant information services - which do provide interpreter services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would like to comment on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer has been appointed under this legislation for the Darling Downs and there are none at present in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the Minister can make the necessary arrangements to overcome this situation and to allow the number of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore request the Minister to have consultations with the colleges of advanced education to make sure that there are plenty of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers available not only for attachment to senior citizens clubs but also to move out into the general public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite a weak and ineffective attempt to discredit the Budget, they have found it difficult, if not impossible, to launch an assault upon this Government’s imaginative and comprehensive range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All 3 Bills should be seen against the backdrop of the work at present being carried out by the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the proposed Australian assistance plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inclusion of home care services, the building of senior citizens centres and the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers in association with these centres could only be applauded as one of the more enlightened concepts of the previous Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be tragically observed by all who concern themselves in community <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do, however, share the Minister’s concern regarding the restrictive use of such centres and would earnestly hope that practical <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and paramedical services could increasingly become a major factor in their development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I should like to comment on the amending legislation regarding the Federal Government’s subsidy increase from one-half to two-thirds of the salaries paid io <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am, however, far from satisfied with the piecemeal manner in which social workers or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers are subsidised within the range of the related subjects of immigration, repatriation, social security and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To obtain a subsidy this municipality must, like all others similarly placed, meet the requirements and restrictions which are appropriate to the various departments sponsoring <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am, of course, aware that other municipalities have, notwithstanding the difficulties I have mentioned, appointed social workers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to work in the general field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must, however, concede that a more integrated program of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, such as that outlined in the Australian Assistance Plan prepared by the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission recently tabled in the House, is likely to be much more beneficial to the municipality I have instanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Government brought these measures down because, with inflation raging as it is, it is essential that some assistance be given immediately in the 3 fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which these 3 Bills cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should say that there would not be a shire councillor or alderman who would not desire to participate in this field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this extra sitting load is imposed upon members, some consideration must be given to the staffing situation of members in their home electorates, so that persons are available to handle the many problems which occur, whether they concern social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, post offices or any of the other general matters that crop up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am requesting that this Government appoint a joint CommonwealthState Committee to ensure we are fully qualified and informed so that eventually we will be able to set up this industry which today I can visualise as being of vital necessity to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Or are we going to be entertained by the same performance as we have had when Ministers of the Federal Government in the areas of housing, transport and health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> have taken proposals to the State Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The residents of the mainland Territories are just as much entitled to be represented in Houses of Parliament where laws affecting their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or levying taxes on them can be made as were the people of the United States of America at the time of their War of Independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In supporting it I personally hope that a continuing review is maintained so that the scheme can be further improved with the objective of assisting not only the migrants in Australia in a personal sense but also improving the whole <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent to all that the program has been controlled by the motive of securing an affluent economy for the nation and virtually nothing has been done towards securing the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrant families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years, previous governments treated the education of migrant children like so many other aspects of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - it was ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, for almost 20 years the Liberals stuck to this balance, ignoring the fact that gradually over the years the circumstances that originally warranted a target of one per cent had changed drastically and, consequently, in the minds of many economists and others actively concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants and their assimilation into the Australian way of life, the target became economically unjustifiable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indication of the attitude that has been adopted generally by this Government in regard to migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At this time, when so much is being done to give a degree of independence to school communities and so much is being done to involve the parents in school councils or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> clubs, assistance needs to be given in those deprived schools where there is this cultural gap to enable the school council, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> club or parent group to ensure that people do not stay away because of a nervousness or fear that they will expose their lack of appreciation and understanding of the education process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am firmly of the view that the best possible service is given and the best outlook obtained by a marriage between government and voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, if this situation could be improved, then it would mean, not only a reduction in the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commitment, but greater production and higher productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures given to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, dealing with retardation, in 1971 put the number of mentally retarded Victorians at between 70,000 and 71,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made what I called an excellent statement to this House on 30 August when he tabled the report of the Interim Commission on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> together with the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is to establish a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is working, people are being paid salaries, letterheads are printed and letters are being written for an institution which purports to be a statutory corporation when the Parliament has not yet authorised its establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Interim Committee of the National Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was appointed on 3 April 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time a specific number of matters has been referred to it by the Minister, including the Australian Assistance Plan, the Aged Persons Homes Act, the home care program, the Senate Standing Committee’s report on mentally and physically handicapped persons in Australia, emergency relief and multi-purpose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan has as its stated aim ‘to assist in the development, at a regional level within a nationally co-ordinated framework, of integrated patterns of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, complementary to income support programs and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also recognised that the suggested composition of these councils - involving representatives of the Australian, State and local governments, trade unions, employer groups, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> consumer groups and non-government bodies concerned with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - rests on an untried assumption, and more needs to be known about what might be a desirable composition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluation of the appropriate population level for the planning and provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services will be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing a recent <span class="highlight">welfare</span> conference in Melbourne the Minister made the following observations: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do we want to see a situation in which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies proliferate and are nationally organised in such a way that there are too many incentives for empire building, demarcation and territorial disputes, and, amongst the personnel, for self-maintenance and career improvement at the possible expense of the rights of the people the system is supposed to be helping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theoretically, a council will have to work in liaison with the Australian Department of Social Security or the State offices of it and up to 13 other Australian Government departments, such as Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-Generals’, Capital Territory, Education, Environment and Conservation, Health, Housing, Immigration, Labour, Northern Territory, Repatriation, Tourism and Recreation and Urban and Regional Development; the State Government in its various departments concerned with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services; local governments - there are 900 of them; the Australian Council of Social Services and the State Council of Social Services; various planning boards in existence and to be set up; and local bodies and charities concerned with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The involvement of the local community and local government bodies in the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services is not entirely a new concept or one exclusive to the proposed assistance plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria the State Government has for a number of years, since 1969, provided a subsidy through the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Department to pay the salary costs of a full time social worker to promote local government involvement in community services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such pilot programs and the proposed action research the hope can be expressed that heed is paid to the experience, pitfalls and insights gained from similar research conducted in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, of which I am sure the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Bill was introduced the Minister has indicated that the Australian Government has decided to emphasise support for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> pro jects proposed by local communities under the assistance plan rather than to proceed with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres operated by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume the reason for it was specifically to cover the position of  Mr Tom  .Roper, who was a member of the Interim Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and who after joining the Interim Committee was elected as a member of the Victorian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to establish formally the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and to set out its powers and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reports referred to the preparations for a comprehensive Australian social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in this very important area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for the nation, particularly the provision of assistance at the local level - a concept which is a new and exciting one - it is imperative that this Parliament should give of its time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can work in conjunction with these organisations in regionally planned councils and gain the very best in a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of Australia will be released from the heavy hand of centralism that for too long characterised the programs of the past Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of my outer suburban electorate are vastly different from the needs of the electorate of, say, the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis),  which is an inner suburban area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members know, the Bill is designed officially to establish the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Labor Party’s policy speech there was no mention of this new instrumentality, to be known as the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, being set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  was vague, as was the first annual report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which, incidentally, this Bill seeks to establish although it has already produced an annual report, and also the booklet entitled ‘The Australian Assistance Plan’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s second reading speech, the booklet entitled ‘The Australian Assistance Plan’ and the annual report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission are full of references to links between the Commonwealth and regional areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security, who is obviously a strong disciple of Parkinson’s law, the first annual report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, the Australian Assistance Plan compiled by members of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the transcript of the comments made by  Mrs Coleman  on the television program ‘Monday Conference’ a few weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  ‘Mrs Coleman’  to whom I have referred will be the full time  Chairman  of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission - at least, I presume she will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, which has been operating for 6 months or so without any authority from this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in front of me the first annual report of the Australian Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>setting up of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I know the position of  Chairman  of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, which carries with it the status of Permanent Head of a Government department and a salary of $25,000 a year plus allowances, including a $34 a day travelling allowance, was not advertised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has just spent more than Sim of the taxpayers’ money on putting out a pamphlet supporting his health scheme but he would not spend a couple of hundred dollars advertising the position of  Chairman  of such a far reaching and important body as the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is there some much bigger, granted social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan quite unlike anything we’ve even known before, that the Government has in mind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, whether it’s in the mind or whether it’s a gleam in somebody’s eye at the moment I guess is the operative question, but we certainly do not want to try to completely restructure the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if one is talking there about the network of cash benefits that are paid as income supports for various people, and the range of personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services that are provided  f -  various people for particular purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in addition to that I think the  function of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is very much broader than to think in terms of even an amended system which will catch the casualties, so to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It looks as if every government department is going to have a member of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission within its organisation - that is, if they are not all swallowed up by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 and the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Annual Report consist of cliches, vague statements, no expenditure estimates - which is typical of many of the pieces of legislation which recently have been brought into this Parliament - and hard to define technical jargon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be a desire and an aim to encourage more people to involve themselves in a much wider range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that there will be an increasing feeling of community involvement in areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which previously has been lacking in many communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that an improved quality of life can result only from more people involving themselves with and assisting local <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I pose the question: Do we need a huge new national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission to achieve these aims? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be conceded that the objective and concept of improved provision and awareness of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will assist many Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my time is almost up I remind the House that I moved the amendment to put on record some of the concerns of members of this Parliament towards the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was set up without parliamentary approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the Australian Assistance Plan is to assist in the development, at a regional level within a nationally co-ordinated framework, of integrated patterns of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, complementary to income support programs and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>-related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies, having regard to the following matters: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That local residents and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> consumer groups are encouraged to participate in the planning and provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was Minister for Social Services I wrote to him repeatedly and asked for information and statistics about the depth and the amount of poverty that existed, the lack of housing and the lack of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my State of New South Wales the State departments operating in this field include the Department of Housing, which administers the State Housing Commission, the Department of Youth and Community Services, which was formerly the Department responsible for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the Police Department and, to name one other State office, chamber magistrates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what is wrong with the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that his Party believed in voluntary involvement in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sight of voluntary workers being forced to beg in the streets to provide basic health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> amenities I find intolerable as, I am sure, do most sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not depend on voluntary helpers to provide all needs including the massive finance that is essential to make our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no co-ordination throughout the whole community to analyse and to dissect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health problems and what is required in a total community program to bring them to fruition over a period to meet the requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the Australian Assistance Plan as the beginning of a program to create a proper integrated <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do see in this a possible danger - I do not say that it is an actual danger; it is a danger against which we have to guard - that the proposed Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission will cut into the field of the voluntary bodies and to some extent impair their successful operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>… for avoiding the duplication of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advance of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program depends on experiment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be worried that in the interpretation of the recommendations for avoiding the duplication of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs there might not be inherent some kind of brake and construction upon voluntary bodies and we might even find the position where worthwhile experiments are not being pursued because they may not commend themselves to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - I should like to commend the Opposition spokesmen on health, the honourable members for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  and Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  and the honourable members for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  and Holt  (Mr Oldmeadow)  from this side of the House for their thoughtful contributions to the debate on the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Bill which is now before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there will be an effort to tie together comprehensively the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which exist and which should and will be developed in the Australian community as a result of the work of this Commission in order to meet the requirements of the people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition spokesman on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  raised questions about clauses 7 (4) and 17 (4) of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very vital aspect in any consideration of what educational programs can contribute in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this is much more broad than merely the concept of poverty; it covers generally the requirements of people who call upon <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services where there is some sort of attendant educational requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concur with his assertions about the valuable role of voluntary agencies in the maintenance of any community based <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a program, as was suggested unkindly by the honourable member for Indi, to centralise <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs at Canberra but rather it is a program for the Australian Government to take up responsibility to fund adequately the development of these programs out in the community - out in the regions where people live - but more importantly to have those people, as much as this is possible, identify what are the priorities in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words we are aiming at a very flexible approach to the development of this program in the community - an approach which will encourage people rather than push them towards achieving the objectives which will best serve the needs of the community in the provision of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said himself that it is the responsibility of the Australian Government to fund adequately the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this Act, there is hereby established a Commission by the name of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the people of Australia should have been informed that a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission would be established if the Australian Labor Party was elected, because this would have indicated that another government department would be established entailing the appointment of the head of the department,  deputy  heads and various other personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made no mention of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission in his policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that an Australian assistance plan would be introduced but he made no mention at all of the fact that it would be necessary to establish a commission by the name of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is going to be a function of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has sent out loose leaf notices telling people to write to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission if they want further reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is actually asking people to write to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, which has not yet been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I scarcely think it is worth delaying the Committee further by repeating the things which have been said by me not only today in this Parliament but also on previous occasions when I have discussed the subject, or the statements of members on the Government side and members of the Opposition, including its spokesman on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ascertain, and report to the Minister on, the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the community and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of those needs; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to make recommendations to the Minister for furthering the achievement of a nationally integrated social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have searched the Bill to see whether there is a requirement for this Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission - that is a rather awe inspiring concept - to report to the Parliament and not only to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-paragraph (vi) of paragraph (b) states: recommendations for avoiding the duplication of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to me to indicate the elimination or abolition of some of the existing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-paragraph (iv) of the same paragraph refers to recommendations for the co-ordination of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities of organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again there is no mention of Parliament on, the likely cost of proposed social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and to advise the Minister on the relative priorities to be given to the implementation of those programs; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Housing has officers well equipped and well served wim advice on proposed social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been able to advise the respective Ministers and the governments of the day with great expertise on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and problems, aided of course by information obtained from interdepartmental committees comprising its own representatives and those from other departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems extraordinary to me to have a provision in a Bill to give a blank cheque to an organisation such as the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to set up a committee on any matter and the committee can have any number of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel it my duty to point out some flashing red lights and register warnings about what could happen under this particular provision concerning the establishment of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the imposition of any excises or any indirect taxes is a distasteful action for any government to take, the fact of the matter is that additional amounts cannot be spent on education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and in other areas without making an additional collection to see that there is not any more net amount of money moving into the economy to aggravate the inflationary situation and by that factor in fact very much diminishing the value of money going into the pockets of working people throughout the length and breadth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could not chop back expenditure on education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and all those other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the massive additional expenditure on health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing and all these other things, I think that for the man in the street the increased fuel charges, which probably could be absorbed by the petrol companies anyway, and the increase on spirits and cigarettes is only a very small price to pay for the additional services given to him through health services, to his children through better education and all the other facets of Government expenditure in the way that they affect people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, however, local government is involved in many other activities, such as those of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, they should be financed out of the same revenue as other governments use to pay for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, that is, local councils must have access to Commonwealth revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 9 months that this Government has been in office its record in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, administration, world affairs and presentation to the Australian people stands unequalled in the annals of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we reduce the allocation for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or social security?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have had considerable disagreement with him in the past on certain subjects, I am firmly convinced that he - like the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who also struck stormy times - is a man who was sincerely motivated in his interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the merger takes place - it will not happen next week, of course, but it will happen as quickly as possible because there is a need to take into account the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the employees - it is likely that the amalgamated department will be called the Department of Construction and Housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know how long it will be before we take the most positive step and employ at least one male and one female Aborigine on the staff of this Parliament and let overseas visitors who come here see that some positive step has been taken to train them in the Parliament that purports to be so concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these indigenous people of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that people can gain information as to what the Government is doing in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for the coloured people is by reading the newspapers, and one reads that so much money has been allocated for this purpose and so much for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their efforts are directed towards communal activities, with special emphasis on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their children and their aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary aim of any government is to assist these people, but in my opinion the methods employed to do so must be clearly denned in every area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area which could be explored to assist the coloured people is the establishment of community centres, complete with trained <span class="highlight">welfare</span> staff, again comprising coloured people, who would run these centres and be available for advice on matters dealing with health, hygiene, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this body, an academic body, has a world importance outside Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has also a tremendous amount to contribute to making a successful policy on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because, without understanding, whatever money we spend will be wastefully spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, again, I think is related very much to a successful approach to these problems of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I wish to take up some of the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who spoke about the subject of Aboriginal affairs in general and about how in many areas and in many ways one would hope - this is as I understood him - that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, Aboriginal advancement and Aboriginal affairs will be treated as non-party issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never at any time questioned his sincerity or his intense interest in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is true that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is taking over the control of and the responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people, lt will be through that channel that most of the administration will be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a government spends money on pensions, on industry, on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or on Aborigines, the department concerned should program its expenditure so that it accounts for its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is proof that all parties in this Parliament are co-operating for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The churches are also heavily committed to assisting Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guilt feeling which had been building up for some time found its expression in the referendum of 1967 when nearly 90 per cent of voters supported the proposition that Aboriginals should be counted as Australians and that the Federal Government should have power to make laws for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy that he will not be able to follow these through, but I am sure that the honourable member will never lose his intense interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the legal advice centres begin operating they are expected to be staffed by salaried lawyers working in close co-operation with community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, established legal aid schemes, referral centres and the private legal profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happens that this is the first place on which the previous Director of <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the Northern Territory Administration,  Mr Harry  Giese, established a wet canteen for the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased with the attitude that has been adopted by the Government to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not been prepared to show that he is concerned for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not look very much for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the handicapped children in our community because they are still running chocolate wheels to raise funds to maintain their own schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he remember what the previous Government did not do about the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> which was tabled in May 1971 in respect of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the mentally and physically handicapped children in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at the legislation on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result many of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals which were put up in 1969 never got off the ground because the States said: ‘You will not give us the money to enable us to provide the matching grants to go on with proposals and build senior citizen centres or to pay <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and so on.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here the overwhelming part of the gross product is comprised of wages and salaries paid to government employees in such areas as education, health, law, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of this, I notice that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and now the Opposition spokesman on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters are trying to beat up an angle on this action of mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no opposition to this Bill going through the House because there is a definite need for finance for the States to proceed with their plans for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, the Opposition does not want to inconvenience the States any further with their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing problem, and we support the Bill before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill, as stated by the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson),  is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to make advances not exceeding $327,975,000 to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing during 1973-74 and the first 6 months of 1974-75 in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Housing and Minister for Works  (Mr Les Johnson)  said in his second reading speech, the purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to make advances to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing during 1973-74 and the first 6 months of 1974-75 in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each of the 5 years commencing 1973-74 the Commonwealth would make advances at low interest rates to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill represents the first real breakthrough in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an enormous increase in the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, and it signifies tha great priority which the Federal Labor Government puis on providing housing for families with a limited income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government, because of its prime commitment to the less privileged, has increased its expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The $10.4m allocated to the State Housing Commission of Western Australia will enable <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing activity to proceed at about the same level as in 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member is interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Melbourne Centre will employ- 1 Sessional Psychiatrist 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Social Worker (number of positions will be dependent on the size of the case-load) 1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 Foremen 4 Instructors 1 Storeman 1 Liaison Officer 1 Clerical Assistant 2 Typists 1 Labourer <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed staffing for the Sydney Centre includes - 1 Sessional Medical Consultant 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Case Work Coordinator (Psychologist)  1 Social Worker (Number of positions will be dependent on the size of the case-load)  1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 Foremen 4 Instructors 1 Storeman 2 Clerical Assistants 1 Typist 1 Labourer <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-38-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that negotiations for the transfer were initiated as a result of repeated representation from the pupils, teachers and others interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the school children in this district? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Cabinet <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee report came before my predecessors in 1970 suggesting that it be phased out in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever he is tackled about it, he bleats in an injured way about how much he has done for the material <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the servicemen - most of it, I might add in passing, initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it must allow Australia to satisfy other national objectives such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and quantitative advancement of our national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has major responsibilities demanding its attention in the traditional areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, defence, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such bodies as the proposed Minerals and Energy Authority, the National Pipeline Authority, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the Australian Industries Development Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enormous increase in expenditure shown in the trust accounts is equal to one-third of the amount made available as grants to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe that a royal commission should be established to inquire into the whole area of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the next few years, further increasing local integration with community health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services will remove more of the old stigma attaching to those need-, ing help which is not just physical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter which, in the ultimate, is what this Parliament is all about because every action we take, however important in the national field, has one ultimate justification - the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the individual citizen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the face of it and on the face of the criteria which are proposed, there clearly would have been no justification for assistance, except perhaps <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance and vast reconstruction and dismantling of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not getting the return we ought to be getting, a return which can be ploughed back into the community in many ways such as investment, as better <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision and as better consumption standards for people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No assessment had ever been made to establish whether these payments should be provided, whether they should be continued or whether the taxpayer should be required to continue paying to surrender some of his living standards so that in some cases a particular powerful supporter could continue to get what can be fairly termed as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment at the expense of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally the advocacy of protection was closely related to the view that national independence and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of wage earners in this country would be promoted by the effect of tariffs in redistributing income from the owners of land to industrial labour and capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that investment is taking place in the wrong parts - that is, if unwise decisions are being made not according to rational economic criteria but according to the pay-off that can be achieved in the back room deals between the Country Party and the people, who are its backers, or it hopes will be its backers - we will not achieve the sort of growth we should achieve; we will not achieve the sort of progress and prosperity we should achieve; and we will not achieve the living standards that should be provided in the community and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services that should be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That just shows the deplorable ignorance of the Minister for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> of the procedures now available, yet he aspires to the Treasury portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the fact that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  has acknowledged my representations to him on this matter and has pointed out that a report from his Department on the current maximum subsidy limits has been referred to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May 1971 the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> recommended that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I thought a more pointed comment was made by the Opposition spokesman on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the honourable member for Hotham, on 21 September in Melbourne at a meeting of the Australian Dental Association when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem is worrying many people, including anthropologists, sociologists and people generally who are concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you take the view that the Country Party style of politics, of using political muscle for a narrow band of special interests, is counterproductive to the cause of optimising resource allocation and maximising economic growth consistent with economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, this new institution might offer an attractive alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be essential for the development of the economy and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians that it should do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 October I announced jointly with the Minister for Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> of Western Aus tralia, the honourable Ronald Thompson, a major social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> co-ordinating project in the south-west and southern agricultural region of Western Australia, as part of the development stage of the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds will be provided for the establishment and operation of a Regional Council for Social Development, which will also be able to recommend financial assistance for a wide range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities, as listed in the schedule in chapter four of Discussion Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This project involves close co-operation between the Western Australian Department for Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government merely continues along its bumbling and arrogant way, caring nothing for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people who elected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make promises and plans for national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and growth while neglecting national security is an absurdity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real issues are what this Government has done on education, cities, health, consumer protection, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and foreign investment, and it is this last subject which is the nub of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me concentrate for a moment on what I consider to be our most serious immediate economic problem - a problem reaching disastrous proportions - intiation, increasing costs and prices undermining the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of ordinary Australians, families, young and old; inflation with its crippling costs bearing down on industry and services; inflation undermining the morals of the people and leading to inevitable restlessness and industrial troubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is about time we measured our achievements in terms of people and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and not money and statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take up one matter raised by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  and to compliment him on one portion of his speech in which he said it is time - to use his words I think - that we should measure the effectiveness of aid as it relates to people and their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and not merely by statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He remains, I understand, as Minister for Science and will be looking after Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How has this Government conducted its affairs in relation to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the honourable member for Grey for his diligence and close attention to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of his constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I agree that the construction of the Monduran Dam and the associated works and weirs on the Kolan and Burnett Rivers are essential for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the sugar industry in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it is no coincidence that the Minister for Environment Control,  Mr Beale,  was sacked from that office because of his ineptitude in looking after conservation matters as they affect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the New South Wales people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my judgment, whilst there is an attraction of a deadly sort to such a sinister plan, one can more readily assume that what Australia should be doing is proceeding with its proper work of looking into exploration, encouraging it to go forward, inviting people to speculate, taking the risks, and doing a proper job in the hope that when Australia does produce oil and gas fields it will be able to play its part in providing these minerals as needed for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our own country and the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that to oppose this Bill at this time and to frustrate the introduction of this Bill is to consolidate further the position of monopolies and cartels within our community at a time when it has long since become apparent that they militate against the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr BOURCHIER (Bendigo) &lt;8.&gt;10)- In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Health, the Repatriation Department and the Department of Social Security I would like to mention firstly the community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres that were introduced this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Department of Health has received some 500 applications for these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres and that now, unless there has been some alteration, something like 120 applications have been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that 100 per cent of the funding of these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres is to be provided by the Government in the first year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until recently I was unaware that it had even appointed a spokesman on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Government for plugging two of the gaps in areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> injustice in providing for the single or no-parent families with dependent children, the supporting mother’s benefit, which clarified one area, and the double orphan’s pension for the parentless or orphan child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I am speaking on the same subject as did the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  but I am quite happy to do that because I believe that there is one area still outstanding which is the single most serious area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> injustice in Australia, and that is the single male parent with dependent children, the widower, the divorced or the deserted father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We shall certainly follow up the work that has already been done by the CSIRO and by the Government Analyst in another part of the Department of Science in ensuring that the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Tasmania are fully safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that Australia has been very well served by the dual system of broadcast ing, and it is my belief that this newly established Department of the Media will serve as the agency that will ensure that broadcasters of this country, whether they be national or commercial, will be encouraged to look forward to another SO years of successful broadcasting in the interests and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The priorities which must be given to other Government programs affecting social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, and urban development, as well as the heavy demands for Post Office, services, especially in and near the metropolitan areas of the capital cities, are such that there must be a substantial redistribution of and increase in both the income and expenditure of the Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has always held the view that the administration of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes has been too fragmented and that their operation should be controlled by the one department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Warilla-Shellharbour the objective is to provide facilities for a rapidly expanding area with sparse health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has excelled all others, in my view, in this respect in relation not only to local government but also <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, industrial groups and just about every kind of community organisation one could think of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our predecessors here and the centralist Government of New South Wales loaded local government with all sorts of new responsibilities in respect of a whole lot of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> duties but it gave local government very little money with which to carry out those tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to detect need in children we must face the fact that families most at risk are least likely to go voluntarily to infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> clinics, least likely to use child care centres, least likely to have the services of competent medical practitioners, social workers or phychological advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Councils are expected - I believe rightly - to concern themselves increasingly in cultural and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and recreational activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we expect local councils to provide facilities over a wide new field, such as infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres, pre-school centres, libraries, a multiplicity of sporting facilities, meals-on-wheels, family guidance clinics, open space, home-help services, social workers, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and youth workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Job vacancies filled by migrant workers with little regard for vocational qualifications, language disabilities, housing and accommodation, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions and adequate eduational facilities for their families, is to create such additional problems as would far outweigh the temporary stopgap policy of manning the assembly lines and filling the less-popular and often lower income vacancies available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates under consideration are not merely those of the Department of Immigration because our Department covers not only immigration but also emigration, settlement and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, citizenship and population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the reason for this is the new emphasis on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and settlement services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is also an increased expenditure on migrant education, a considerably increased expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and in addition to that we have appointed 48 multilingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers as another part of the new effort to ensure happier and more successful settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned before that the Government’s policy on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is a piecemeal affair, with no apparent direction or control and I think, the report tabled by the former Minister proves my contention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 December 1972, the Government established the Department of Aboriginal Affairs incorporating the former Office of Aboriginal Affairs with a large part of the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Division of the Northern Territory Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee decided to press the urgent need for an integrated approach to the planning of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in Albury-Wodonga; to bring to the notice of the Ministerial Council the acute shortage of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers in the area, particularly those experienced in youth work; to ask the Cities Commission for a study of the effect of the growth centre on the ecology; to press for the regular release of planning information so that Albury-Wodonga businessmen can plan for the future; and to ask that the Development Corporation consider the need for infant and child care facilities in commercial development and community facilities, as well as providing for the disabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is always quick to criticise the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system Labor has developed and the few so-called bludgers who receive unemployment or sickness benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole problem must be related to the Government’s proposals to take account of the fact that invention is a very important contributing factor to overall <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree that this mythology that is now common in folklore in Australia that Aboriginals are receiving up to ‘$200 a week merely by going down to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments and putting out their hands is injurious to the race relations that we hope to improve in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We increased government spending by about 3 per cent to accommodate more people and in addition we greatly extended the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, including pensions, education and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Together with the anomaly relating to the single male parent, I think these are 2 basic weaknesses in our present social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr and Mrs King have made representations to me and, as a result of investigations made by my Department, I wrote to the then Minister for Youth and Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in New South Wales, the Honourable J. L. Waddy, seeking his assistance in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-54-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we have to understand that the worth of the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs is being largely negated by the inflation they intensify. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little point in spending heavily on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> if that spending is simply going to generate inflation that takes away the increased benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been increasing public expenditure on education, housing and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cover low income earners and people in the community who have special need for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and income supplements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the whole purpose of the survey was to identify these people and the sorts of profiles that they represent for the development of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program as conceived by the poverty inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government health scheme would benefit only pensioners, migrants, indolents, no-hopers and alcoholics, the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spokesman,  Mr Chipp,  said yesterday’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These deficiences need progressive reforms, which have been under intensive examination by the Liberal Party’s committee on social security, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> over the past several months, and I know also by the Country Party’s health and social security committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the major guidelines submitted to working parties by my committee on social security, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are as follows: We believe as a committee that health care reasonably available is a right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, excessive attention to the doctor-patient relationship has led, I believe, to treatment of problems which may be psycho-social rather than medical, such treatment being by completely inappropriate means by doctors who do not have training in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is just a little late on that because we have put that up, and this is part of our proposals which the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) and others have acclaimed as one of the good features of our scheme - more than I can say, unfortunately, for the Federal  President  of the Australian Medical Association who informed us at a meeting of the Caucus <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee in Canberra some months ago that he could see no good thing in the scheme and there was no point in discussing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would support a proposal of temporary insurance for those who are unavoidably uninsured, justified on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government pushed that resolution through on the grounds that it would be inimical to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the citizens of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst other things it added some S340m in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are sorry that Opposition members have so little real interest in health insurance and health care that they have been unable to do more in this debate than to reiterate unproven - and unproveable - assertions that health care will suffer if the means of financing it is rationalised and to demonstrate that they are more concerned about the material self-interest and the private ambitions of a small clique of people than they are about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electors have inflicted stinging rebuffs at the ballot box to those politicians who have sought to push the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state so far that it has become an intolerable tax burden to the people and so that all the other spending in the public sector is constrained by what is going on there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome this Commission, as I welcomed the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, because it brings the operations of government out into the open but, as the honourable member for Hotham has pointed out, we do have some reservation about the way in which this particular Bill is going to achieve these ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Bill passed by this House a little time ago, section 16, referring to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, provides: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and a number of education commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it was clearly of a psychosocial origin, I believe that in only 2 cases did a doctor refer the patient for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we get in to the health centre context in which there is a more ready availability of paramedical services and other supportive services, such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> counselling, I think we will find that there will be far less recourse to drugs with the consequent problem of drug induced disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the large amount of public money that is being diverted to these types of ventures, it appears as though there is not really very much return from them by way of the increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or health of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr CHIPP (Hotham)- by leave - When the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  is replying will he also answer the question asked by the honourable member for Isaacs  (Mr Hamer)  as to whether between now and the passage of this Bill through the Senate he will give consideration to amending the Bill to allow for reports under this Bill to be treated in the same way as are reports that are submitted to the Minister under the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the amendments mentioned tonight - those that have been moved and those that have been discussed with me but not moved - were never mentioned in relation to the Bill which led to the setting up of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission suggests to me that this is a rather late, panic reaction in the hope that something will be done by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, nobody seemed very much afraid that it would happen with the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Com mission although, essentially, the functions of the 2 Commissions will run parallel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He quoted from the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Bill which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is a little more than ironic for members of the Opposition to start lecturing this Government about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill sets out in detail to cover the various aspects of petroleum and minerals and assures the Australian people that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this nation will not be neglected and that we will not sell out our resources to foreign powers merely for a mess of pottage to meet a current situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the organisations have been given permanent statutory form, such as the Schools Commission, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, the Hospitals and Health Services Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Pipeline Authority; others have had their statutory charter utterly transformed, such as the Grants Commission, the Cities Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was something about which civilised men - Australians who have the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia at heart - could sit down and say: ‘Here is something we can give to you because it is proper and correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prime Minister McMahon’s high opinion of  Dr Coombs  was shown by the fact that under him there was the first considerable increase in the appropriations for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have spent more of my time, since coming to this Parliament, concerning myself with the problems of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than with any other specific issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has established the Australian Commission on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and through it, the Australian assistance plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inflation, in essence, reduces the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The increased social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and other expanded forms of public assistance undertaken this year will, in large measure, be illusory money increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>However, I would like to assure the House, as well as those interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian tourist industry, that these examples may be handicaps but they are not absolute deterrents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (8.21)- At the opening of the second session of the 28th Parliament  Her  Majesty the Queen referred to many measures that her Government intended to introduce for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness to the Aboriginal population, I do not think that I would have to go outside my own electorate to see things which would make any Aboriginal want to protest if he was genuinely interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of his own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seem to indicate to me that the elected parliamentarians, in the discharge of their duties, should have regard to the people of Australia as a whole and at all times endeavour to secure the advancement of the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, including that of our Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote the Speech of the Queen in regard to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>: It stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The betterment of Australia’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system remains a major objective of my Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having in mind the establishment of a Government insurance office and the extended terms of reference of the Woodhouse Committee, especially the words ‘together with the application of the scheme where death results from such sickness or defect’, one wonders how open-ended the Government’s intentions are in this area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would commend anything that is humanitarian but I would remind the Government that it is not a bottomless pit from which one funds social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state might be all very well in theory but someone has to pay for these benefits and someone has to fund this so-called Australian Government insurance office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia increased by only 14 per cent during the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer used the argument that if we are to have this payment system we should have it on a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one time that this Government has put this policy of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> into play in agriculture it has been disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was with one of its fruit compensation schemes because of currency revaluation whereby it paid $12 a ton up to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cutoff point on the one hand, and on the other hand took away $10 a ton right across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody in the fruit industry wants a repeat of that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to reorganise the administration of our economic aid programs is based on the view that improvements in aid must be affected in almost all aspects of our aid endeavours - in the machinery for formulating policy, in ensuring greater attention to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various schemes, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that people are now back at work, rural incomes have trebled, profits are going through the roof, our trade surpluses are embarrassingly high and look like going higher, tariffs have been reduced, the dollar is sound and more realistically valued, we are out of Vietnam, conscription has been abolished and our relations with Asia and Africa have now been brought out of the colonial era, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is now taking its rightful place in our order of priorities, the 2 Jeremiahs of  Her  Majesty’s Opposition daily pronounce imminent disaster and chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two further areas where the Government has taken new initiatives are in the road safety and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amount of $20,000 has been provided for reflectorised markings on the Pacific Highway and for special turning lanes at the Tuggerah turn-off, and $5,000 has been provided for the Central Coast Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Co-ordinating Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very real concern in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field was expressed and translated in the actions of the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has taken a number of new initiatives in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector, involving payments to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By its action the Australian Government prevented the closure of this vital industry on 30 September last and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of hundreds of people was sustained and maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I “believe that the Aboriginal community ought to be consulted much more than is being done on matters affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I resume my seat, I would like to bring some <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters to the notice of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, as then, the honourable member and those who sit behind him show a complete disinterest in the reports on conditions in government and Catholic schools which have been prepared by bodies such as the Inner Suburban Education Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, various organisations of teachers and parents, the migrant education task force and the Interim Schools Commission itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everywhere I go I find local government people speaking with excitement and enthusiasm about the functions such as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health care, conservation and the development of leisure facilities, which they can perform so much better than either the Australian Government or the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, a significant number of people in Australia today live on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments rather than choose to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that very shortly the 48 multi-lingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers will complete their training and be in the field, bringing to the migrant settlers, particularly those with language problems, therange of help and guidance that is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But speaking generally, I hope that the extension of the emergency interpreter services, telephone services, the appointment of the 48 multi-lingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers who will shortly be in the field, and steps like these will put the shysters out of business and give the newcomers a better deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate the importance of this matter because many of the policy initiatives which the Minister for Immigration claims to have introduced in relation to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants in Australia were policy initiatives formerly announced by my colleagues the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  or the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such policy initiatives, which the Minister claims to have introduced, as the development of new and expanded <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, the schools program, the examination of the problems of over 60 inner city schools in Melbourne, the emergency telephone service, expanded facilities for teaching English, the policy of re-union of families - which was announced in 1968  -  and expanded migrant counselling services were all announced before the Minister came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s opponents say that if the Government wants to have a decent <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state it will have to encourage increased productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People need to be paid a wage and a return commensurate with the contribution they make to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the wellbeing of the community of which they are a part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On pensions, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or defence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly, the productive sector has to be encouraged if any government is to be able to implement its social educational <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use the Labor Party saying: ‘We can withdraw all those now and leave the rural industry to look after itself, thinking that by so doing if things again fall into a state of decline it will be able to introduce <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies and thereby re-establish prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly important because there has been an insufficient output of social workers in this country and as a result of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies we will need more of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it involves community involvement in determining and planning <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies at the local level, with everybody, including the recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, being involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened to the appealing pre-election Utopian economic and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies of this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speech also mentioned the setting up of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission which will develop the Australian assistance plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program has some desirable aims, but it will clearly take a sharp rise in national output to make these objectives feasible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is making greatly increased sums available to Western Australia for education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the cities and other areas in line with its national policies in these fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of several Bills which must necessarily be passed through Parliament each year, and that is normal in the sense that funds are required and are authorised by Parliament in a series of Bills for the payment of government services such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, grants to the States, administration, defence and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also claimed that the Australian Labor Government’s plans, its intentions, much of its thinking and its history require it to redistribute resources away from areas of lesser importance towards areas of great national need - areas that include social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the relief of poverty, education, health and the solution of quality of life problems in the cities - and that this will have an adverse effect on business in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong and growing business sector is one of the keys to achievement of Labor’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the practices of reactionary people in the community who resent any efforts to liberalise social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable members that the evidence there shows that these sorts of assertions are grossly over-blown and I do not believe that the Liberal Party does itself any credit, if it claims to be a liberal party, by jumping on the bandwaggon of reaction where social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and services are concerned and where peoples’ fundamental rights to self respect and dignity are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These concerned <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, school programs, a special telephone service and expanded facilities for English language teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have found that they are in the main - there are probably exceptions to the general rule - completely dedicated to trying to promote the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of primary industry and that they do not spare themselves when there is need for a special effort in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these points have been detailed in that sample survey which has been submitted to the poverty inquiry and I repeat that I hope that very soon I can release that report so that we can kill some of this most obnoxious, unfair and in too many cases thoroughly dishonest misrepresentation which has been broadcast in the community in an effort to discredit the development of a comprehensive system of social security benefits and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which are based on a truly liberal philosophy in which the dignity of the individual is respected and his right to self-realisation and achievement in society is fostered in every reasonable sort of way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its achievements in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and benefits to date, in really such a short time, are so significant and are such an advance on what has gone before that the public confidence and respect in identifying the Labor Party in this way is clearly well placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to continuing and unfounded rumours, the Bill confirms the Government’s continuing and vital interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those who have served their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More money is now being given to more charities because people carrying out the obligation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work or working with Lifeline do not work within the definition of relief of the poor or afflicted and therefore in the past did not receive the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the Willoughby Community Aid and Information Centre, which provides counselling service on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of my speaking tonight is to assist the people of the Kilcoy area and that shire in their appeal to anybody who will help and to Brisbane’s Lord Mayor to consider their safety and their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and to open, certainly under control, the flood gates to get the water level down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because these dams supply water to Brisbane and because they are for flood mitigation for Brisbane, it is no wonder that my people are disturbed, alarmed and incensed at the manner in which their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has been disregarded and their property damaged and put at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst this may have meant a few weeks delay, and whilst we have been getting a second opinion on the matter and also asking the Fry Committee to discuss this question with the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to see what can be done to accelerate the whole program, the whole intention of the Government is to accelerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It occurs to me that the way to demonstrate real concern for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients is not by advancing the implementation of a single increase by a fortnight, hut by ensuring that increases are in fact adequate to the need and directed as quickly and effectively as can be done to areas of maximum need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It began in February of last year when the Minister for Social Security said that he had told his Department to adopt a new philosophy towards social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and gave the direction to his Department that merely because an employer did not find a registered applicant’s appearance acceptable, it was not sufficient reason to debar him from unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> approach, whether it was in the form of unemployment benefits or a relief program such as the one I instanced, combined or separately, assumed major influence in the local economy and I would suggest that this was rather an unhealthy sort of situation to have occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They need support from health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services at the community level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to help many of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That shows that the Labor Government is concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of exservicemen and their dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to continuing and unfounded rumours, the Bill confirms the Government’s continuing and vital interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those who have served their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering this matter I am reminded of the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> concerning repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member quoted at great length from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> which investigated the Repatriation Act, in particular the provisions of the Repatriation Act relating to the payment of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through our related policies on roads, on making up the sewerage backlog, on urban public transport investment, on the environment, on education, on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programmes and on health we are also seeking to bring an end to the isolated and incomplete development of new urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its thin veneer of concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people has been readily exposed by the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  who is the shadow Minister for Housing, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to look at the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the total community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All reports which the Government has commissioned have been tabled; for example, the Coombs Task Force report; the Priorities Review Committee report; the Green and White Papers on Health Insurance; the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission - First Report; the Protection Commission Inquiry; a report from the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission concerning Aged Person’s Housing; the First Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Land Tenures; the Re-organisation of the Defence Group of Departments; the Care and Education of Young Children - a report of the Australian Pre-schools Committee; report of the Advisory Committee on CES Employment Statistics, and many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that this document of Professor Henderson’s will be seminal in its influence and valuable in the contribution which it will make to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in Australia and to the relief of relative poverty in the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr CHIPP (Hotham) &lt;8.38)- The report which the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  has tabled is one for which all honourable members and all parties who are interested in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> have been waiting a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Parliament spends hundreds of millions of dollars on all sorts of subsidies and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That rapid growth in terms of orthodox Western theory does not necessarily produce, and has so far not produced, increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or justice is by now widely recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He suggested that the proposed agency would ensure that greater attention would be given to the way in which our aid program would be administered in the countries to which it was given - that it would be examined to make sure that the effect of our aid was to promote the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have clearly indicated that I believe people should be encouraged to use small motor cars and that motor vehicle manufacturers should be required to build into small cars safety features that are necessary to protect the life and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people who travel in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to reorganise the administration of our economic aid programs is based on the view that improvements in aid must be effected in almost all aspects of our aid endeavours - in the machinery for formulating policy,, in ensuring greater attention to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various schemes, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that meeting the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  stated quite specifically that when a Labor government came to power in this country donations to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies of this sort would be tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is any room for doubt that the Government sees aid as a contribution by the Australian people to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our less fortunate neighbours and that this is the way in which the people of this country want to see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the speech gave some very important guide lines as to the objectives of the new Agency, such as ensuring greater attention to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and distributive effects of our aid, in improved evaluation of our aid programs, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Schooling for Aboriginal children at Yirrkala, or at any of the schools formerly administered by the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Branch of the Department of the Interior, was not compulsory until December 1973, when by amendment to the Northern Territory Education Ordinance, compulsory education was extended to all Northern Territory children between the ages of 6 and 15, subject to accessibility to school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there is the circumstance that fishing is really part and parcel of the sustenance of very many people around the coastline of Papua New Guinea, and in particular it is of great importance to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and their future stability in terms not only of sustenance but also of the gradual development of commercial fishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the $70m-odd could be well used in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments because the needs are great, but the concept does not bear close study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I mention a debate it reminds me of the fact that the honourable member for Hotham, who is the Opposition spokesman on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters and who has followed these matters so closely in the last 18 months, would be well enough versed to enter into a debate of this subject without having a copy of what I might happen to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will create chaos in the industry in the name of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because it was in the name of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - or so-called social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> - that the Government changed these dairying industry policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as the people are well aware, the relic Opposition majority in the Senate has continually blocked major items of our mandate - our policies on health, education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, urban living, land acquisition- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After 23 years of Liberal rule, during which time the Minister for Civil Aviation was a Queenslander and so much neglect was apparent in Brisbane, it is astounding to hear these people suddenly take an interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Brisbane and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Opposition seemed to become terribly upset, irate and indignant when a document containing the policy recommendations of the Liberal Party’s Committee on Social Security, Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, which they regard as confidential, was produced in the House today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very often Australian industry has been accorded too much attention in the changes that have to take place in a world where we have a responsibility to have regard to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our own people and also to make our contribution to the development of peoples in other countries, especially the lesser developed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Conference of Australasian Ministers for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, in endorsing that conclusion, considered there was a need for a conference of the Australian State adoption officers and interested Australian Government Departments to discuss, inter alia, such an agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the decrease in unemployment figures since the election of the Labor Government indicates an improvement in the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the country, does the Minister have any figures indicating whether the reduction in the unemployment figures is the total measure of the buoyancy of the economy and the benefits that flow to those seeking work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the right honourable member’s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I have no record of having received a letter from  Mr Thompson,  former Minister for Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to families based on the number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His period as Minister for Health and Social Services was of particular importance to the Labor Government of the time and of particular significance for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the intention of my Department and, in fact, of the Government to ensure that money made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing produces the best possible result and is used effectively to provide housing for low income people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing is certain, namely, that there is prima facie evidence which enables me to say that some of the land acquired from these companies is to be used for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Built in to that system is a second tier which is <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before I proceed to that point, I might mention that it is interesting that the honourable member for Hotham is basing his opposition to our scheme not so much on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of patients but on the interests of private hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that, if the position were to be reversed and the Opposition were to be in government again, it would be equally as austere in what it did in any area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services as it was austere in those areas as a government up to 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are consistent with the very generous approach which we have adopted to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While they represent an energetic breakthrough, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services have been neglected for far too long for us to rest on our laurels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see that this Government is determined to provide adequate finance for the expansion of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis running through the Governor-General’s Speech was on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and care and consideration for people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a nation rich enough to provide for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of these recommendations one would expect that a government which for the time being was custodian of the great social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> powers of this Commonwealth and which was formed by a Party which has claimed to be the traditional guardian of the poor would have committed itself immediately and irrevocably to a program to rescue them from their worsening plight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program which the Government has unfolded is one that gives to the haves - albeit in part - at the expense of those who now have more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government has adorned the Governor-General’s Speech with the old familiar phrases - ‘protection for the weaker section of the community’, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing will be provided ‘as soon as circumstances permit’, the next Budget will make further increases in social security, and it will also provide for increased assistance for the handicapped and disabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the people are to be taxed to an inordinate extent the community just cannot afford the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, however attractive it may seem to some, which the Government urges upon us and at the same time adopt an effective program against poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is not a satisfactory vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another broad aspect of the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program to which I would like to refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me however make it quite clear that I am not talking about cities, housing, education, nor am I criticising the abolition of the means test or suggesting that there is no need for reform in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not so much the areas in which the Government’s program seeks to give assistance - such as health, pensions, general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and amenities - about which I speak, but the extent to which it would embrace the life of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I ask sincerely: What does the average Australian who is not poor require in times of economic stability by way of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of his Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that these are basic and perennial questions, but I believe we have to answer them now in this Parliament because of the nature of the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the Government’s projected social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program offends not only because it affords our poor nothing like effective social justice but also because it threatens to turn us into a dependent people coddled and propped up by the state at every turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not be deluded into thinking that all the Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program is humanism at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable gentlemen on the other side of this House to reconsider their social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program not only because in substance it ignores the poor for the affluent, but because it threatens to set us on a path which, if followed to its logical conclusion, will significantly dehumanise our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  concern for poverty is gratifying and T am sure that we can look forward to his support for our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and low income housing policies which have been outlined in the Governor-General’s Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good the Minister for Social Security being so half smart about the Australian wool industry in its hour of need as he was this morning at question time because he is going to require thousands of millions of dollars to carry out the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ambitions of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Regular Defence Forces <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association is establishing a fighting fund to brief senior counsel and obtain a legal opinion on the recovery of the surplus for the benefit of the people to whom it rightfully belongs - pre- 1 959 contributors, retirees and widows as at 30 June 1969? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated yesterday during the debate on a matter of public importance, we are concerned that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is not receiving the attention that it should receive and we are hopeful this year that we will be able also to remedy that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must be integrated with related economic and social policies in the areas of industry development, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave no direct answer to that very great problem which confronts a large number of the elderly sick in our community, and the families who have a concern for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Assistance Plan, which is a program for community based regional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs administered at the local level, retains a high priority with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I resent and reject strongly the efforts of the spokesman for the Opposition on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, the honourable member for Hotham, to denigrate this very important initiative- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to warn the people in those local areas of what they could expect, in the light of the statement by the spokesman for the Opposition on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, if the Opposition were to become the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the Opposition has now changed its attitude towards this very worthwhile community based program of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, and if the Opposition were to be the government it would cut back that program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to this point of time I have taken the view that it is far better to centralise the Federal Government’s support for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the words I used were that it was one of the most exciting and memorable advances in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ever tabled in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also given further .consideration to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those who will be leaving the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also had to take account of our commitments to other programs of high priority such as education, health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and above all of the general state of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need for the national Government to involve itself, not by directly overseeing urban development projects and becoming a giant landlord and developer, but by providing additional funds to local government for capital works programs such as day and child care centres, recreational and care centres for children both after school and during holiday periods; parks, gardens and flora and fauna reserves; family and community counselling facilities, particularly among migrant communities; library and recreational facilities; health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres, including family planning and infant health centres; sewerage and drainage schemes; and road, street and bridge works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the greater community awareness of social issues and rising expectations of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, local government has been required to provide many of the facilities and services I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Urban and Regional Development has acquired a reputation of being concerned for individuals and their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and I pay him tribute for his concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is supposed to be one of those social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs about which honourable members opposite skite that they wish to take some action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these actions by the conservationists have been taken with a disregard for the immediate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a representative of a large number of wool growers, I am very deeply concerned about the claim that was made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  that 3 members of the Australian Wool Corporation had stooped to the level of completelydisregarding their responsibilities as members of the Corporation by conspiring with the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Sinclair),  and thereby placing in jeopardy the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people engaged in the wool industry, in order to promote an attitude within the Corporation in regard to price levels for wool that was designed only to embarrass the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission’s report on the matter will be tabled in due course and we would expect a good deal of public discussion thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general rule, the free market forces may be effective in generating an adequate degree of economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a proper action to take to reduce the demand for housing in the private sector back to the level where supply was able to “cope with demand - for building resources - and also to try to divert resources in into the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field and through the housing money made available through the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I abhor the fact that in doing this in the public interest, at the cost of their own <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, members of the Builders Labourers Federation found that their organisation was deregistered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would go so far as to say that people would be sleeping in the open, in parks and the like, if it were not for the magnificent work that is being done at present by the voluntary social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies such as St Vincent de Paul even by professional social workers working after hours and by the churches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need is clearly established when we look at the figures supplied by the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups in my electorate, again using the definition of emergency housing that I used before - meaning a need for housing for the immediate night or the immediate week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investigation that was carried out by social workers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations in the municipalities of Springvale, Dandenong and Berwick showed that the groups most affected were, as one might imagine, the one parent families, particularly deserted wives; families who were evicted from their houses; the elderly; and also, in areas like those centred in Dandenong, quite a large group of young people and families who come to those areas in the expectation of easy employment because cities such as Dandenong are reputed to be boom cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I am well aware that, he as the Minister has been responsible for negotiation with, the States whereby allocations for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing have been higher than ever before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has embarked upon what is a most ambitious social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the right honourable member’s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) In my Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> policy speech on behalf of the Australian Government at Melbourne on 1 May 1974, I said ‘the actual time of the introduction of this program will be a policy decision and accordingly will be announced once that decision has taken place.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is constantly re-assessing its priorities in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> services catering for the aged could be put out of business because of Federal Government financial restrictions, the director of aged services at Melbourne’s Brotherhood of St Laurence,  Mr N.  Brooke, said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It promised to set up under a particular Act in 1969 a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system that would help to keep these kinds of patients in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is required is a clear statement of the extent to which the Government sees these services as being instruments of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and decentralisation and to what extent it sees them as being business undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Labor Treasurer - cleared the decks, as he put it, to initiate Labor’s great <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and at the same time he put the kiss of death on every union journal in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case, there would have to be a cutback on the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interwoven into the economy is the need for organisations like the Post Office to pay their own way in order that we may be able to assist in avenues of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> those who are needy instead of subsidising a service that should pay its own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed increases are an endeavour to make up this leeway and to make available money for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes, pensions and other things of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not have to take from the taxpayers moneys which can be devoted to education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of interest now, caused by this Government which is allegedly concerned with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and has a social conscience, is the highest on record in Australia’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Labor Government has also broken another promise it made in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, that is, the promise to remove the means test for persons 70 years of age and over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister see any justice in a man who has been deserted by his wife and who has been left with 4 children to care for receiving no assistance under the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program of the Labor Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling it the Department of Repatriation and Compensation could be the thin edge of the wedge that will eventually mean the disappearance of the Repatriation Department and those 800,000 surviving ex-servicemen and women will see the disappearance of their specialised department which devotes itself entirely to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and treatment of these ex-servicemen and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure the ex-servicemen and women of Australia that we in the Country Party and the Liberal Party will continue to show a vital interest in the future <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the exservicemen and women of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As powers in respect of adoption and related child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters are retained by the State governments under the Constitution, consultation with State governments is necessary and a national conference has been arranged for 24 and 25 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable gentlemen were to read the report of the committee of inquiry into preschool education by Miss Fry which was tabled about 8 months ago, the report by the Australian Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which was tabled yesterday and the report by the Priorities Review Staff which also was tabled yesterday, they would see that this is a very complex matter; that in fact there are very great difficulties in carrying out a program of care and education of children before they go to primary school, particularly in the light of the varied circumstances in the different States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are rapidly approaching the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is Orwell’s ‘1984’; that is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister not disturbed about the way costs of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are already rising in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister envisaged a time when the total hand-outs or pay-outs for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would represent 12 per cent of gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these days it has become more important than ever for there to be both public involvement - certainly significant public involvement - and private involvement in this area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to assist their vested interests by obtaining and maintaining for the Australian people the best <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service available by way of a scheme whose application is practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has education proposals and proposals for pre-school and child care, a superannuation scheme, a compensation scheme and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister should concern himself not with the amalgamation of unions but with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1; that is the first report to which the honourable gentleman referred - the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet just recently the honourable gentleman, referring to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission’s report, said that it was tabled yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable gentleman also say that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report which was tabled on Tuesday is different from the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report of last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister announced on 18 February that the Government had asked the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to examine the Fry Committee report he made this announcement in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst this may have meant a few weeks’ delay, and whilst we have been getting a second opinion on the matter and also asking the Fry Committee to discuss this question with the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to see what can be done to accelerate the whole program the whole intention of the Government is to accelerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a demurrer from the Priorities Review Committee and one from the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman wishes to quote from the speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  let us go on from the part where he refers to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the Priorities Review staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report which the Prime Minister had long before I did, and which I call the Coleman report or the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report, refers to the need to spend $130m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report speaks about the areas where it considers priority would be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had the Fry report, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report and now, of course, the Priorities Review Staff has recommended that the commencement of the program be postponed so that the Government and the community would have time to prepare for its implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only this week have we received the report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission - the Coleman report - and also the report of the Priorities Review Staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it takes time to arouse interest in the community and some local government organisations are very tentative at the present time in relation to the support that should be given to embarking  upon any further projects in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian dairy farmer is a quite competent farmer and has contributed in a most meaningful way to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be detrimental to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people engaged in the industry and to the industry itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish each level of government to be in a position to perform better its assigned functions for the better <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all our citizens wherever they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the primary causes of the domestic inflation in Australia has not only been the Government’s misjudgment but its failure to encourage further investment in the productive sector at a time when the Government’s budgetary and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies are injecting excess liquidity into the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not need a cradle-to-the-grave society in which the Government will dictate all aspects of our daily lives, and expect those of us who still want to work to pay dearly for the ultimate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state in which the individual will lose all freedom of choice and the capacity to plan his destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Health Bills are designed to bring about the nationalisation of medicine in Australia - to bring about a more expensive and less efficient system of looking after the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments have increased social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, they have become more heavily committed to education, and they have provided services in those areas where free enterprise showed no interest or have taken over those services where free enterprise was unable to make a profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is a real and pressing case for decentralisation of authority and that local governments will best perform many governmental functions in such critical areas as <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, culture and the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each State has a public and professional education program, a research program and several States have a patient <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>National cancer control has been seriously inhibited by lack of funds for basic research, for the application of research knowledge to the practical management of cancer, for public education and for patient <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that the Australian Assistance Plan or some other agency of this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Government would look into this problem which by no means is confined to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political party like the Country Party which rarely receives more than about 10 per cent of the votes of the Australian people has a disproportionate influence on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon),  made some very hurtful references to my colleague, the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  and implied that he had no interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of country people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This health scheme would drag away all of that expenditure on those items of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Doctors are losing the goodwill of the patients- the goodwill that used to exist between them- because, so far as the patients can see, the doctors or, to give them their due, the doctors represented by these associations are much more concerned with their own position and how much money they can earn than with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The experiment of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state was something new and its consequences were not appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin my contribution to this very important debate on the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill by acknowledging the work of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  and of  Mr T.  M. Fitzgerald who prepared a report on the contribution of the mineral industry to Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fitzgerald  pointed out that the first economic task of any government is to raise the standards and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people, and particularly those sections of the people who have been most disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, many of the needs for a better quality of life cannot be charged for at all, and resistance to the further use of these methods- the paying for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the wellbeing of the people- as  Mr Fitzgerald  points out, have become as strong as the public desire for social improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Australia an exceptional opportunity for improving standards of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and wellbeing of our people did open out in the 1960s with this great unsurge of mineral discoveries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the foundations laid in the formative years of the mineral revival would have effects on Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span> lasting for decades or (as it turned out) for generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>small in relation to the big values of high quality mineral resources being extracted and exported, the mineral industry is not contributing to the supreme task of raising <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Petroleum and Minerals Authority will not be operating in some declining and unprofitable field, into which public enterprise is normally allowed to function, but it will take a leading part in safeguarding and developing the vast mineral wealth of Australia, as the heritage of the people, and as one of the main sources of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people for many generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only Labor can ensure that our national Wealth is used for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people and not for the enrichment of just a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That report is neither a full nor accurate assessment of the contribution made by the mining industry to Australia’s economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This report upon which the Minister for Overseas Trade places such importance takes a narrow, myopic view of the industry’s contribution to Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that all told it looks as if the mining industry may have made a contribution to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> during the 5-year period referred to of something to the order of $700m and not, as the Minister has claimed, as if a contribution has been made to the mining industry of $55m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike the traditional concept of a post-secondary or graduate institution providing training of an educational and professional nature towards the granting of degrees to persons of a certain age group, the United Nations University is visualised as an inter-connected world-wide system of academic institutions devoted to advanced research and training, through an interdisciplinary approach, on problems of human survival, development and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the intended role of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission as at 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The answer to the right honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2), (3) and (4) While no specific mention of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee was made in 1972, its principles are implicit in the Government’s pre- 1972 election statements on the need for a total community approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The creation of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission in 1 973 is one pan of the Government’s program to achieve these aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>member’s question about the role of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and any changes planned for that role, I would refer him to Section 14 of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-57">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>

    <p>The Government’s overriding objective is to get on with our various initiatives in the fields of education, health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and urban improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not prepared to vary its previous decision and allocate more from the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the expense of our priority programmes in the fields of education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And expressions of the sort that it is reported the Prime Minister used in the Caucus yesterday in relation to artists are quite surprising for people who thought that they could trust his interest in their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beyond the substantial improvements to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services many areas of expenditure are specifically geared to maximise benefits for low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the principle for the allocation of funds for schools under the Schools Commission program, for child care, for local government under the Grants Commission, for community health centres and hospitals, for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, for area improvement programs, for the Australian assistance plan and for Aboriginal advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No self respecting government can tolerate the delaying of the business of Parliament by frivolous motions moved for political purposes, in an endeavour to hold up the business of this Government in this Parliament where we legislate for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill enables State and Territory child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to be used as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers for the purpose of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-23-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also enables other persons, including <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers employed in the Australian Public Service, to be used or appointed as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-23-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it will be necessary as a matter of good administration to use <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers other than State and Territory <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers remains, of course, to be seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-23-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst we are aware of the fact that the trade union control within the Department is very profound and very significant, whilst we are aware of the fact that that great Department is absolutely vital to the economy and to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian nation, and whilst we are absolutely sure that we know that this great Department can be strangled by industrial action, we must admit that over these next 9 months the most likely scene in Australia will be that of further disruption and further effects of the inflationary process upon the Postmaster-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday the Family <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Bureau in New South Wales had its annual meeting and closed its doors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard the closing down of the Bureau, a voluntary social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation in New <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Family <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Bureau in fact did receive grants from numbers of Government departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sum which in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field I believe we cannot afford to lose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know from my own involvement in the Provisional Committee in Parramatta that the social worker from the Family <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Bureau was endeavouring to assist in the promotion of that plan in the Parramatta district with a view to participation in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the late  Mrs Henry,  who I understand was one of the senior officers in the department in Sydney, discussed these matters at length with the senior officers of the Family <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Bureau, no means could be found whereby money could be made available for social workers to be maintained in their present positions and for this valuable organisation to be able to continue to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be in the plan of this Government that voluntary organisations should be done away with and should be seen as being no longer important in the plan of things for providing and meeting <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer announced in the Budget that $25m of the money allocated to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was unused at the end of the 1973-74 period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Last financial year the Government made available $2 18m- I think some 26 per cent more than in the previous year -for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and of that amount $16m was unspent by New South Wales and $9m was unspent by Victoria, making a total of $25m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been very concerned that funds made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing have remained unspent considering that there has been such a large number of outstanding applications for Housing Commission homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that some consideration could be given to this work which is more important than, perhaps, some areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that have been undertaken by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private investment has been falling away rapidly and in the long term, particularly now that a tax has been placed on people who have made an effort in the past to be thrifty, this will cripple our ability as a nation to meet those payments of scale to our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, our health care programs and also to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, it is a Budget which has attempted to purchase a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program at the expense of the economy required to sustain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, within the profession itself there is a feeling towards medical services and the practice of medicine in the community which is preventive and which gives continuing care and makes use of all the ancillary services such as social workers, infant and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, marriage guidance counsellors and the various therapists to whom I could refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No government can meet the great clamour from the people for better services, better education, better <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, better defence, better roads and all the rest of it, while it does so many things to damage the nation’s productive capacity, to discourage people from investing their earnings and their savings in producing industries, and to persuade people that they are wrong, if not stupid, to seek to advance themselves and their families through hard work and thrift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the social justice aspects of this Budget I refer to the great strides that are being made to overcome very important deficiencies in the educational and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I say that this is a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  has authorised me to make this announcement: A joint meeting of the Caucus Economic and Trade Committee and the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee, of which I am the Secretary, was held today with the concurrence of the Treasurer and with his agreement has recommended to Cabinet variations in the proposed legislation which would ensure that retired people and sick and infirm people earning a moderate income from property will not suffer any hardship whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inherent in that proposition that the individual’s success is the community’s success is that it is only through the creation of community wealth by the efforts of individuals in the community that it is possible for governments to undertake social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and to fund their operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Snedden  is on record from the last election as giving an assurance that growth of spending would be maintained in key areas such as health, education, urban improvement and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way he can cut back on the growth of public spending without hacking into education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, allocations to the States, urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has provided in the Budget for a significant increase of funds for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are so heartrendingly attached to the gospel of State rightism and so viciously opposed to this Federal Government that they put party politics before the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation and refuse to give us the powers we need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He won because the people of his electorate recognised that he was a strong man, a man who had a lot to give and a man who would represent his electorate and build for himself a career in the national Parliament where he could contribute to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is remembered by the people of his electorate for his independence of spirit, his devotion to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the great kindliness and friendliness with which he performed his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  has authorised me to make this announcement: A joint meeting of the Caucus Economic and Trade Committee and the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee, of which I am the Secretary, was held today with the concurrence of the Treasurer and with his agreement has recommended - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an important initiative which has been welcomed by those who have a genuine interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that with this most generous increase in subsidy the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of tenants is safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If inflation hits people receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, the Government says: ‘Increase those payments but do nothing about the basic rate of inflation which erodes those same payments and makes them worth less than the lesser amount a year or two earlier’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the year by year ad hoc-ery of Liberal-Country Party attempts, the Budget is drawn up around carefully framed programs- education programs, health programs, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, urban improvement programs and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances does the Acting Prime Minister believe that the superphosphate bounty to which he referred in Tasmania yesterday might well be seen as a measure by which production and productivity could be encouraged rather than as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the description of the superphosphate bounty as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision is a new one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, it has been a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision for a long time for quite a number of people who did not need it, especially the wealthy farmers who got most of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was very largely as a result of this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision by which previous governments were willing to make the assistance available to primary industry that we decided to bring an end to the existing arrangement and refer the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission, albeit on a narrow basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  contained a great many items concerned with this country’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxpayer gains through increased social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, education, roads, sewerage, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where can we find anywhere in this document at all a comprehensive, internally consistent and effective series of remedies which are likely over the whole field of activities- that is the Budget, exchange rates, monetary and interest rate policies, wages policy and a psychology that can be designed to ensure that all the ingredients are there and are brought together consistently- to ensure the better <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget introduced by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  on 17 September was a reaffirmation of this Government’s determination to continue its program of social reform, that is, to maintain the momentum and the thrust in the fields of education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To return to matters of substance, I want to relate most of my comments to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commitment in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field the Government has responded to the needs and the very legitimate aspirations of all pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision by the Government to recognise the plight of parents with handicapped children is one of the most pleasing features of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude with the same sentiment with which I began: The Budget is a document that maintains the thrust and momentum in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and educational fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we have also been determined -  they showed great courage-  to find room for measures having merit on broader grounds of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment expresses the concern of the Australian people for our future and our <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not our responsibility but I would be prepared, as an individual, to suggest and be responsible for a cut right across the board- in expenditure on health, education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, culture and urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is proposed in the Budget for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, urban and regional development, culture and recreation are, in the main, worth while and they bring little criticism from me other than in the broad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is from the free enterprise system that the Government obtains the tax revenue to pay for the very desirable social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs that we all support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and hospitalisation are all top priorities in any country similarly situated to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear them talk about the Budget being a social justice and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has shown a consistency of purpose in its adherence to stated and published <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy no matter what the opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all the Government has demonstrated to those who had any doubts about what was said to be its lavish <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program that such program would be implemented despite the desperate methods used within and without the Parliament to prevent its implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise the issue here, for the disgrace is that the funds for the dilapidated buildings, the branch maintenance funds, originally were allocated by the Parliament to the State on the trust that it would look after the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the State citizens- all Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the State is not performing the functions entrusted to it the Australian Government should take a closer interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of neglected people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am, therefore, pleased that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing will be a priority of the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all areas of maintenance work- painting, structural repairs and plumbing- there is sufficient work to ensure a continuity of employment for some time not in the provision of new homes but in making existing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> homes comparable to the homes supplied by private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, members of the Labor Party go home and say that they have increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and that the people should be happy about that The people will realise, as the months roll on, just what a disaster this Budget has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Areas like the Central Coast where building booms had taken off were already years behind in basic amenities, such as water, sewerage, roads, drainage, kerbing and guttering, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, recreational, sporting, health and educational facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will bring the people, the community, into the planning stages for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the system depends upon the decisions of individuals to invest or not to invest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mean that the much larger public sector can maintain planned and ongoing investment and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditures, and thereby reducing the vulnerability of the economy as a whole to the stops and starts of international capitalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a huge increase in outlays on education, a large outlay on public hospitals, and more funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of the Budget is directed to continuing the programs in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health, urban and regional development and many other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly on the expenditure side we welcome the significantly increased outlays, for instance, upon education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conference believes that the fundamental prerequisite of the co-operation envisaged in this Resolution is full and continuing consultation between the Government and the trade union movement on all matters affecting the level and direction of economic activity and the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there was an increase of 78 per cent in expenditure on education; $7Sm was provided for pre-school and child care programs; $28m was made available to commence the construction of new hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane; provision was made for home dialysis appliances free of charge; additional funds were provided for nursing homes and for the national drug education program; a further step has been taken in the abolition of the means test for pensioners; increased rent assistance has been given to pensioners; there has been a doubling of the capital subsidy available under the Aged Persons Homes Act; a new handicapped childs allowance of $ 10 a week is to be paid to parents and guardians in respect of a child under 16 years of age who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention; a 34 per cent increase, which is $67m, is to be made available in grants to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and there is the possibility of further grants should circumstances warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be largely concentrating on the impact of this Budget and of other Government decisions on agriculture, on country towns, and on the economic and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of rural people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to touch on the social and economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people living in rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France and Canada are countries which paid more in terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments than Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions should ensure that he never will be threatened with poverty or insecurity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 10 of the Reserve Bank Act states that the Board has the duty within its powers to operate its own policies- I will not go through this in detail- and to operate them in such a way that they contribute to 3 matters, the first of which is the stability of the currency of Australia and the third of which is the economic prosperity and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have offered them money for a variety of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes and again some States, particularly New South Wales and Queensland and to a lesser extent, I think, Victoria, have not taken up these offers and the people go without. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a result could be achieved only by slashing into existing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it cut down on education, on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, on health and on urban and regional policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances it is reasonable for the Government to expand programs in this way, particularly programs with a strong <span class="highlight">welfare</span> element which are so difficult for those conservative and affluent representatives on the Opposition side to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast, the Opposition would cut back sharply on health, education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ignores the dependence of individual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have cut taxation by a commonsense $430m, consistent with our economic and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that nearly all families will benefit in areas of education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labour and materials that would have gone into erecting city office blocks later to be only half tenanted can be diverted into public programs such as schools, hospitals, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, local government and regional development, community building and sewerage works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this we could not hope to achieve our program for housing, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, health services and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again in this Budget the Australian people have been asked to believe that, provided the Government spends record amounts, in the short term the quality of life must improve, that opportunities for education must be greater and that better social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will result, while all the time the potential recipients of this mythical Government generosity are being asked to pay a greater and greater share of their income in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone wants a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state provided they do not have to pay for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was elected on a grand design for income redistribution combined with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies to help the low income earners within our community, but it has ignored the fact that inflation is reducing the real purchasing power of income, that there is a rapidly falling value of money, that prices for goods and services are rising and that there is a lower net income as taxes increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The growth of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and community advancement programs are desirable- but they must ultimately depend upon our economic prosperity and upon our willingness and ability to pay for additional services through higher taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is impossible for any government to continue to spend record amounts on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community services and at the same time seriously attempt to restrain rises in costs and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, if honourable members will reflect back on the report on homeless men I think they will acknowledge it was one of the better reports that has come out of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field in recent .times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More importantly with a conservative government in the past, spending on education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the public infrastructure was inadequate and this was at a time when we were supposed to be able to afford to spend in such areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Care.fully reading through the last one one gathers that the Liberals if they were in government would wipe the Department of Urban and Regional Development, restore a few subsidies and throw aU <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs into reverse or hold except in those areas where there might be a few votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do you want to remain an individualist not only for yourself but also for your children and your children’s children or do you want a giant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state where initiative is taken away from you, incentives are abolished and the people of this nation fade into a murky oblivion?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be compared with what the honourable member for Parramatta says about  Mr Eric  Butler whom he invited to address the Young Liberal Movement in Parramatta and whom he said would inform it on all matters affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of young people in the western area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new allowance should be seen in the context of the broad program of education, training and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for handicapped children being developed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Parents or guardians who care for a handicapped child at home will be encouraged to take full advantage of the facilities that are being made available under the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and the child’s attendance at a day school or training centre will not affect eligibility for payment of the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask them: Which of these priorities that we have so far chosen in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area would they argue should not have been chosen so that some other action could have replaced what we did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee of the Government under the distinguished and inspiring leadership of the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  has a working party thoroughly researching a system of guaranteed income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, to establish beyond any doubt the credentials of this Government, I point out that in the 1 972-73 Budget the previous Liberal-Country Party Government increased expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by 15.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy making and the administration of child care and family <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Darling Downs has read closely the 3 reports that the Government has commissioned on this matter- the report of the Interim Committee for the Pre-school Education Commission, the report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the report of the Priorities Review Staff- he will know that the maintenance of standards has been a matter of very great concern to the Government and its advisers and that very properly provision has been made to see that standards are maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are now involved in providing a huge range of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services on a very closely integrated basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Reading the publications of the Australian Government Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles laid down in the Karmel report and the principles laid down in the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission’s report on the ways in which these things ought to be done are the means by which the present Government will stay in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it cannot be either virtually social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is to these people that we owe a special concern which lamentably has not been forthcoming from the Victorian Department of Aboriginal Affairs to which so far their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has been entrusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise the question of their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> tonight because the takeover of the affairs of Aborigines in Victoria by the Australian Government is now so imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will allow a very big advance in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in all the fields in which it has been assisted in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of these funds will permit more assistance to be given to the States to provide housing, health, education, employment, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community services for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) and (2) Grants under the Australian Assistance Plan are not made available to local government bodies to the exclusion of all other community bodies nor to a series of separate community bodies including local government Such an arrangement would aggravate the fragmentation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, weaken the capacity for co-operation in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, and defeat the objective of community involvement in regional decision making on such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-56-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-There should, of course, be preference for programs in the fields of health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and urban improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 people in charge of implementing this idea, from the local Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Consultative Council- Gerry Govier and Arthur Mortimer- were able to entertain these 300 people from Port Adelaide, who came from an area which, as I said, has no library, to have a look at the most up-to-date facilities that can be provided for the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What evidence exists that States have so restricted their social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budgets that in order to obtain revenue they have to rob children who have been deprived of their parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world is well on the way to the acceptance of this profound truth, that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all the people in all lands depends primarily on full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can well remember that in the first couple of weeks of holding the post of Minister for Repatriation I raised with senior officers of the Department this matter of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who had been prisoners of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is finding that it is caught with these promises and will have to make huge increases in repatriation and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> votes in order to meet those promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, those people have an eligibility for pension at 60 years of age rather than the normal age for eligibility for a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> pension of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister mentioned that in the past his Government has increased social service benefits only to see the State governments reduce their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits by an equal amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must look at social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in a wider context than that of dispensing charity to the disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told by every responsible social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation in the country that this is an area of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, instead of smirking or smiling, should note that action in the area of child endowment has been recommended by the Henderson Committee and by all responsible social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Maybe the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations could be deputed as agents to pay the money out in trust and then substantiate their claims with the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1973-74 Budget the increase in social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments was 18.4 per cent; the overall expenditure in all of the other items was 20.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how much the Minister comes into this House and says: ‘Look what we are doing in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’, what he got for his Department in Cabinet in the Budget was less than the Minister for Tourism and Recreation got. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be fair, in the 1974-75 Budget the increase in social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments was 38 per cent, but nevertheless it was less than the increase for education, for urban and regional development, for culture- whatever that means, and we know that there have been massive increases in expenditure in the name of culture in recent times- and indeed for recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that his association with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and with people in this area has most likely awakened him to the needs, but I do not believe that it has awakened the leadership of his Party to those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assume that if what the honourable member for Hotham says is the policy of the Liberal-Country Party coalition were to be carried out, as he said, immediately upon its assumption of office, we can add another $ 1,000m to the expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because that is the sort of money he was talking about this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I had time I should like to deal with the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> philosophy and the achievements of this Government, the sorts of things we still have to do and so forth, but I shall concentrate on two or three specific things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  said in his second reading speech, the allowance should be seen in the context of our broad program of education, training and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for handicapped children being developed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At times when I approach a debate on Bills such as the legislation before us I regret that so many divisions in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact the Government’s policies as they affect the social and economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of persons on new land farms make a laughing stock of the Green Paper recommendations that the aim of policy should be to reduce disparities in public services and amenities as between rural and urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I do not think breeding herds would be sacrificed, farmers would not get any cash flow and assistance would have to be made directly on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds unless in the meantime some form of credit can be instituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that now it has been shown by the Opposition that the Bill is not a compensation Bill but a new social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Bill the Government will consider the consequences of that and consider how a proper compensation scheme could be developed in this country so as to take away the anomalies and inadequacies of the present approaches to compensation throughout this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who do not need compensation very often would be afforded assistance that would in fact be to their detriment, not to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see in this bypassing, as I see in other legislation, evidence of another example of what I think is a disturbing trend in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation and something about which I intend to speak in this House on the estimates for the Department of Social Security, that is, the tendency to institutionalise our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Chifley amendment to the Constitutionsection 51 placitum(xxiii) and placitum (xxiiiA)- there is no doubt that responsibility lies with this Government to initiate this type of legislation which is one of the greatest <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals that has ever been introduced by this or any government for the people for which it is responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis,  Mr Justice  Woodhouse met IS members of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is one of those fundamental changes in the structure of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system which cannot be lightly accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first and most important is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and wellbeing of the men, women and children of Australia in the future who are going to be entitled to the benefits which this Bill is designed to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 3 October departmental officers and 2 statisticians briefed the Opposition <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Flat accommodation was freely available at competitive and relatively low rentals and housing commissions were able to make a positive contribution in the so-called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The integration of all housing policies with urban, regional and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies in such a way as to ensure that every family can secure accommodation of its own choosing, appropriate to its own needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we need this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and we need it desperately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the restraint comes to housing I guess it will be in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing because this is the area which those opposite have consistently neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an absolute and urgent necessity for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from the States not spending their allocations under <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing provisions as happened last year when they returned to the Treasury an amount of $25m, I am pleased to see that the builders are now co-operating and tendering for the construction of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are: <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing, changes in the Defence Service Homes scheme, housing for the aged, indicative planning, the Australian Housing Corporation, the Australian Housing Research Council, the housing information and advisory service, modern housing techniques, uniform housing standards and housing tax relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures are designed to bring to fruition our aims in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to bring to fruition policies in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters include such aspects as economic affairs, health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and whatever a member’s interests may be, particularly in dealing with certain aspects of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is made here for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and community activities of $1.5m to provide for the maintenance of State wards and other children, assistance to missions for the care of children, maintenance of mental patients and the care of those people in necessitous circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is symptomatic of the state of debate in this chamber and the community at large that there has been little intelligent analysis of the Fitzgerald report on the contribution of the minerals industry to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the Government determined to identify national interest in this whole area it was necessary to examine the real contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia- hence the Fitzgerald report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have failed completely to realise that the private business sector, particularly the manufacturing group, involves the people who produce the goods, the wealth, the employment and the revenue which pays for the non-productive spheres of our society such as education, health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, industrial amenities and funds for Government housing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition then went on to say that health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure would be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in fact, the policy of the Opposition in regard to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> represents a very severe cutback in the wideranging programs administered by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he is the spokesman for the Opposition on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, although one can never quite detect who is really the spokesman for the Opposition on such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to pay the States this year the sum of $3 10m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This authority will enable the Treasurer to continue payment to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the period from 1 July 1975 until an appropriation measure for 1 975-76 is passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the June Premiers’ Conference we agreed to advance $235m to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, however, the Prime Minister stated that the Government stood  ready to consult with the States on the provision of additional advances this financial year in the light of developments in the housing industry, the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to productive use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that I have since had discussions with the States about progress on their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs in the current year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a conference in Canberra on 1 1 October, I announced to State Ministers that the Australian Government would provide an additional $75m to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These additional funds will enable the States to take advantage of the present situation in the housing industry to increase their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing activities in a substantial degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can do all that is required for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of the Communist countries, ourselves and other democratic countries by promoting trade which is an important aspect of our relationship with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legitimacy of the proposition that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is a right for everyone is, in my opinion, a theme of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the previous Federal election the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  outlined the policy in respect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both of these areas I have realised the importance of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I recall aright, in the Budget Speech the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  said that Australia must be restored to a position of leadership in the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, and I do not think that anyone would deny assistance to people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget is something like $3,44 lm of a total budget of $ 16,274m, which is 21 per cent of the total budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  endeavoured to make out a case that this Government in its 2 years in office has been the only government that has ever done anything in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and his predecessors did have a very humane approach to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our standard of living improves, so obviously we must improve our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, no one can seriously suggest that since Federation the parties to which honourable members opposite belong, irrespective of what they have called themselves, have given the depth of thought to the people in receipt of social security payments or social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments that the Australian Labor Party has given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suggest that honourable members opposite were only using social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as a hobby because they had to accept it as part of their responsibility when they formed a national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to confine my remarks to one small section of the estimates for the Department of Social Securityindeed, it accounts for only about 0.2 per cent of the Government’s proposed expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this current financial year- and I refer to the Australian assistance plan which, in my opinion, is one of this Government ‘s most constructive and exciting initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian assistance plan was formulated by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic objective of the plan is to involve people in regional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities and to assist them in the development of integrated patterns of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services within their community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this aim, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, in its Discussion Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regional council was expected to involve representatives of the Australian, State and local governments, trade unions and employer groups, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> consumer groups and non-government bodies associated with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this represented a very substantial break from previous government involvement with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because here it was being recommended that residents within a region would determine their own social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities rather than have those priorities determined for them by a remote government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would also be handling and allocating Australian Government funds to meet these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs in their community and this was probably an even bigger break with the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission recognised these difficulties and recommended that a pilot program be undertaken with one regional council in each State being given administrative finance and also funds for allocation for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> purposes; the amount of these funds for allocation to be determined on the basis of $2 per person living in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government which was not genuinely interested in community involvement or in overcoming the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> deficiencies most acutely concerning the people would not have taken the chances that this plan clearly involves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this with some feeling because my electorate is in the western suburbs of Melbourne and this region of Melbourne was chosen by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission as the area in which to have a full scale trial of the plan within Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons for choosing this region presumably were that it is a lower income region with pressing needs in all areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that in recent years an active group of concerned people had come together within the region to assess the needs of the area, to draw attention to the deprived nature of the region and to press for action to overcome these social deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time the Australian Assistance Plan was first mooted in August last year there was therefore already in existence in this region a body which included many persons interested in or working in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area who had already done a lot of work on assessing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs in the region and who were willing and eager to become involved in such a plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the general committee covered a wide spectrum of occupations and interests in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the Council was formed it had then to set about the process of allocating the $700,000 of capitation money to various social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been used to extend and initiate Meals on Wheels services, to provide a full-time co-ordinator of social planning for the regional committee on the ageing, to establish community centres, to conduct social research and to assist a variety of migrant, youth and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups to maintain and extend their services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, it has provided a tremendous fillip to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the region and, importantly, has raised enormously the level of community interest and activity in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention also that under the Australian Assistance Plan there is provision for community development officers who will have the principal task of stimulating involvement of people in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities and assisting <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view he has very little interest in their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and is merely using them as a means of attracting attention to himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the commission which has been announced is indicative of the interest that we have taken in this matter because its administration in both the education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fields will be undertaken by representatives of all the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because the Victorian Attorney-General has claimed that the activities of the Australian Government contravened the law, will the Minister tell this House in what areas the Australian Government’s initiatives are contrary to the Constitution and whether he expects a High Court challenge by the Victorian Government to Australian Government policies relating to education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, legal aid and/or financial assistance for municipalities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government seeks to give effect to its policies of greater social justice, more expenditure of money on education and increased spending on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social services, within the constitutional framework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister inform the House what measures have been taken to stimulate the expansion of the Australian assistance plan so that more people have the chance to be involved in developing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities in their own community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather curious that the spokesman for the Opposition on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, the honourable member for Hotham, seems to have been selected for this role not because of what he can contribute constructively on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters but for what he can do for the Opposition in either containing commitments in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field or destroying worthwhile programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only this week I received a letter from a person who is a constituent of the honourable member for Hotham, and is involved in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, bemoaning the fact that, as he put it, ‘Don Chipp has changed from being a reason-  able small ‘1’ liberal to becoming a quite reactionary and repressive person where the issues of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are concerned’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I sincerely regret that the policy of the Opposition as articulated by the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, seems to be one of destruction where community development is concerned in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee of the parliamentary Labor Party in September 1972- again before the Labor Party was in government- made certain proposals on schools commissions, for which we had agitated for some years, to provide equality of opportunity, to investigate inequalities, to recommend programs, to advise the Government, to be the organ of intelligence and insight, to sponsor and conduct research into all aspects of education, and indeed into all aspects of child care and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, including the economic, mental and moral well being of children, to sponsor experimental schools and programs, to educate teachers, assist student teachers, foster in-service and continuing education, to consult pre-school authorities, town planners, pediatricians, child psychiatrists, to provide for child minding and pre-school centres and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provides for a <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Payment to the ITF which is used by the ITF to support <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities for seafarers throughout the world and which replaces the contributions made by National Flag carriers either by donation or taxation to maintain such centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures, however, are only an interim step pending receipt of the report of a Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, which was set up by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission about twelve months ago at my direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That means there will be a slashing of expenditure on education and on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘Let us spend it on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and cut down defence expenditure’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current rather difficult financial situation, with a Labor Government keen to develop its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, I would have hoped that the Cabinet would be a little more sympathetic to the claims of the defence forces in this year and in the years ahead, because we all accept that there is a need for a long lead time in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out also that, as in the case of that other area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the Australian Assistance Plan, the Minister’s policy almost falls upon barren ground because of disputes that have arisen over the boundaries that are being forced upon local committees under this plan for regions that was put before the Parliament last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided that improvements must be effected in all aspects of our aid endeavours- in the machinery for formulating policy, in ensuring greater attention to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various programs, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the Government’s aid efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, service clubs, local government, health, religion and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is his attitude to the view of the interim committee that a regional structure for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be combined with the already established regional structure for the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> responsibilities involve all levels of Government and a large variety of voluntary organisations, the development of the pilot stage of the programme has sought to involve representation from all of these sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frequently, the major initiative in preparing a submission for funding under the Australian Assistance Plan has come from municipal social workers or from social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> advisory committees attached to municipal bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regional councils for Social Development are expected to relate to other regional planning bodies but will require the capacity to undertake independent examination of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals and to make recommendations on such proposals for the allocation of funds under the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that we can plan and we can organise systematically to ensure that Australia, at least in respect of coal exports and within the limits of its known reserves, can make a very notable contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the prosperity of Japan and quite a number of countries in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only yesterday I was discussing this proposed measure with a local association of school <span class="highlight">welfare</span> clubs of various primary schools in my electorate and the neighbouring electorate of Barker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in response to a letter I arranged to meet the school <span class="highlight">welfare</span> clubs for a discussion and an exchange of views on the question of children’s television, particularly in regard to the advertising that takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told the women representing the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> clubs not to underestimate the power of commercial television operators to put pressure on certain people to prevent teeth being put into this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention that the Government has already approved no less than $3 10m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing purposes in 1974-75 and, after carefully reviewing the situation in Queensland, we have now agreed to provide a further $8m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, they say, will be brought about by the present Government, particularly with assistance to local government for such services as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures, including child care and those sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners primarily a Commonwealth responsibilty <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) It is considered that there is a responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners at all levels of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has a decision been made on assistance for improvements to be made to the Murray Music and Drama Club submitted by the Murray Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to the Australia Council for the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill, which repeals the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act, consolidates and extends the Australian Government’s programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad details of the new measures were contained in an announcement I made earlier this year, when I outlined a 1 5-point program for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Australian Government provides for the general economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the disabled, it is the voluntary organisations that are able to help, in a way not always possible for a Government department, in the personal day-to-day care of many mentally or physically handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now becoming obvious to anyone with half a brain that with a rising long-term bond rate the pegged concessional rate of interest is producing serious inequities and the benefits of those obtaining <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing compared to the rest of the community, especially including those without any house at all, are staggering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Agreement has also created serious social problems because of its discriminatory effect upon those persons in the community unfortunate enough to have to pay the market rate of interest, which may be perhaps 11% per cent or 12 per cent It seems to me to be totally unfair that the action of this Government has forced the majority of home buyers and home builders to pay 4 per cent or 5 per cent more in interest than the select few who will be able to purchase a home as a result of this so-called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party ‘s housing policy states: … the integration of all housing policies with urban, regional and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies in such a way to ensure that every family can secure accommodation of its own choosing appropriate to its own needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill involves advances by the Australian Government of $3 10m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1974-75, almost double the amount spent by the States in the last year of the Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, the result was that part of the record amounts made available by this government were left unspent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government had not taken responsible action, if it had not introduced restraints, there would have been little hope of stepping up activities in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing area and as well most homeseekers in the private housing market would have been permanently excluded by rising costs from ever purchasing their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion the argument was, and I believe that the argument remains now, that money spent through these sources is spent more efficiently than money spent through the other sources of funds that are available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Housing and Construction pointed out in his second reading speech that the purpose of these 2 Bills is, firstly, to enable the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to appropriate $3 10m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1974-75 and, secondly, to make certain amendments to the 1973 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet even now the Liberals still want to return to the days when <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was accorded a low priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition had its way the States this year would receive $102m less for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing than they will in fact receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjustments of this type have already occurred as a result of the Commonwealth taking over the responsibility for financing tertiary education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and, at the recent Premiers’ Conference, the Prime Minister announced that the Financial Assistance Grants would be further reduced as a result of Commonwealth initiatives in the fields of Aboriginal Affairs and assistance to deserted wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These local government bodies are becoming heavily involved in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, conservation, child care and the provision of pre-school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a separate Bill a record amount of money is being provided to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, a tax originally introduced to finance a particular <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure has simply become a further element of a complex revenue raising system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that the Opposition spokesman for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and related matters is at the table because I believe he would agree wholeheartedly with this view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that every possible consideration has been extended to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the residents there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, local government is playing an increasing role in the provision of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, recreational and cultural amenities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If local government is to provide an increasing measure of our community’s physical amenities and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, as opposed to the more traditional forms of basic economic assistance clearly it requires greater recourse to the nation’s general revenue resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regional organisations of Councils were set up exclusively for the purposes of the Grants Commission Act, but it now appears that the Australian Government favours these organisations accepting at least some degree of responsibility in relation to other programmes in the field of Urban and Regional Development and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> (Australian Assistance Plan). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land purchase for recreation, erection of community buildings and several much needed <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and youth programmes that would involve the appointment of staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hope that this sort of attitude is gone forever because it should be obvious to anyone interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of local government, which is related to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of disadvantaged citizens and_ areas, that the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government and its counterparts in the State governments had no intention of giving any real assistance to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For all this time the city has waited for an answer because it is in dire need of the funds so that it can maintain its program and continue its employment of its employees, let alone provide all those <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for which the people of Stirling are clamouring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the Seaman Committee of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission estimated that the cost of building an aged persons home in Rockhampton- my friend from Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  might support me in this- is 40 per cent higher than the cost of building an aged persons home in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appointment of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers under the Aus.tralian assistance scheme will no doubt overcome the problem eventually <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the 1973 Housing Agreement the Australian Government provides substantial financial assistance to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and the Agreement specifically provides that the advances may be used for the purpose of providing accommodation for couples of which the main breadwinner is an invalid, and for single invalid persons as well as for families in receipt of low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer himself, who did not have the good grace to come into the chamber and listen to his colleague this morning, has had to admit that he does not believe in the typical type of Budget, that he does not believe in a Budget setting out the program for the future and in giving the guidelines and the limits within which business, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other kinds of operations can work in the fiscal year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did say- I admit this- that there would be an across the board cut but he went on to say as well- I believe that this must be stated as a matter of accuracy and truth- that priority would be given in the fields of education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The findings showed an overall desire to double education expenditure, health and foreign aid, increase social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> outlays by one-quarter and slash- by two-thirds- defence spending and spending on economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This kind of luxurious waste of Government funds to prove a touch of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sophistication, sits sadly atop a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system which barely provides adequately for the financial day-to-day needs of the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That obviously means that there will need to be a cutback on the present increase which this Government has budgeted for and, if necessary, of course that will mean a cutback of 8 per cent across the board, but necessarily there will be very high preference and priority given to programmes in the fields of health, education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By contrast, the Children’s Bureau under the LiberalCountry Party Government will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers who will retain the responsibility for the administration of programs within their specific portfolios- e.g., health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my personal hope that the States will be generous in allocating amounts to that purpose in clause 14 which is concerned with the provision of staff to promote safety, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in individual colleges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From my experience in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> I am bound to say that there is such a diversity in the level of advancement of Aborigines and in the levels of their living conditions that there is no simple common answer to the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is true to say that most of the blame- if ‘blame’ is the right word- for that rests with his colleagues rather than my own because one can look at the record of the Tonkin Labor Government in Western Australia and see that long before there was a massive provision of federal funds in the field of Aboriginal affairs the Tonkin Labor Government had managed to make great strides in terms of Aboriginal policy and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how much one tries to get the Leader of the Opposition into a corner he cannot deny that his policy would result in cuts not only in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> but also in education, health and all the other essentials that make up the greater part of government expenditure in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reality of the situation is that the Government is expected to provide certain services for its citizens- things like education, health services, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, payments to the States, cash transfer payment to citizens and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission, in turn, set up on 12 November 1973, a Working Party on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Manpower under Section 1 4 (f) of its Act- to consider and report to the Minister on measures designed to provide skilled staff for the successful implementation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the Commission’s approach will leave the Government free to deal with questions of long term assistance in a way which promotes the long term <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present, therefore, is not a suitable time for implementing significant structural changes- however necessary such changes may be to improve the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australiansbecause the immediate cost would be further temporary disruption to employment and a resulting increase in deprivation for employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will leave the Government free to deal with questions of long term assistance in a way which promotes the long term <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community as a whole and in accordance with the industry assistance policy expressed in the Commission’s statutory guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will provide the Government with advice on the availability of general measures to support the complementary policies being developed to facilitate structural changes, to ease their private adjustment costs, and to develop those low cost industries which contribute most to efficient use of the community’s resources and, thus, its general <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having in mind the balance which the Government must hold between the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the effect of changes on individual <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, I should like more attention to be directed to this general approach which appears to provide a sound base upon which to encourage at a. manageable rate the greater efficiency, and with this the greater prosperity, of Australian industry in the interests of the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the  Deputy  Prime Minister now give the House an unequivocal assurance- as his predecessor, I understand, did- that when he does become the Treasurer he will not recommend the withdrawal of taxation deductibility of donations to voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals contained in this Bill are a further indication of the Government’s concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of nursing home patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be well aware of the emphasis placed by the present Australian Government on all aspects of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, especially those involving the more socially disadvantaged people in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In delivering the Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy speech on 1 May 1 974, 1 gave further details of the policy the Government had endorsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill offers a subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the salary of a suitably qualified or experienced social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker employed at a homeless persons centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker’ includes a social worker, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer, psychologist, occupational therapist or other person providing a service or treatment for homeless people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The funds for these subsidies will be provided from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund and provision has been made for expenditure of up to $550,000 for the remainder of the year 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s belief in social justice, which has been demonstrated by massive inputs to our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, opens up the possibility of programs such as this leading to a diminution of the problem through the rehabilitation of this group of the socially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my intention to establish these committees as quickly as possible, ensuring that all involved in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the homeless participate in the work of the committees.This then is the substance of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, however, an understandable reluctance on the part of many firms- and also of employees- to leave areas of activity with which they are familiar, even if those activities may be costly to the community or may not be contributing fully to national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence of this need for increased assistance is obvious to anybody who has some involvement with voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is indisputable that the States have both the historical and practical background in broad social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> functions which is simply not going to be utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AAP, to my knowledge, does not provide financial assistance to State government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bodies and this Bill specifically excludes it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be most incongruous that States should be able to receive financial assistance for education and health programs for handicapped people but not for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want their services delivered by local <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is vital to increase the effectiveness of voluntary organisations, it is also important to increase the effectiveness and build on the experience and practical wisdom of the State <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the limitations of State <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt that local government bodies in Australia have the historical or the practical background or framework upon which to build hastily complex <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, as I understand it, it is departmental policy to insist that programs for handicapped people be funded by the handicapped persons <span class="highlight">welfare</span> section of the Department of Social Security and not through AAP funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 previously mentioned Acts recognised that to establish health and education <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services is a major undertaking and too great for some communities to initiate at all or to initiate within a reasonable period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister spoke in most glowing terms about the relationships between the statutory and the private and voluntary sectors in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider this Bill to be another step forward in the Government’s 15 point program for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with great regret that I look back on the years that this scheme has been operating and that an overall plan for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people was not one of the prime objectives of this Parliament when it first sat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program for all kinds of handicapped people has been like Topsy; it has just grown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It consolidates and expands the programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Australian Government provides for the general economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the disabled, it is the voluntary organisations that are able to help, in a way not possible for a government department, in the personal day-to-day care of many mentally or physically handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that there is not a member on either side of this House who would not desire to assist in providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It aims to consolidate and to extend the help which is given to voluntary organisations which undertake the task of looking after the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many spheres of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> the States have said that they have had to fill in the gap which, in the past, has been left by Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read articles by the Sub-Normal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association which state that it is all very well to subsidise the establishment of buildings but it is another matter to keep up with the running costs of those institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw that happen last week in the debate on the concessional rate for what is called the ‘low income earner’ in relation to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to challenge the Opposition to state exactly what is its pension policy and exactly what areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would be savagely cut back under its proposals consistent with its statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specific documented cases can be produced by local general practitioners, church organisations, community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups, the Royal District Nursing Service and the East Bentleigh police concerning emotional difficulties, suicide, chronic illness, psychiatric disorders, mental retardation, alcoholism, drug abuse, marital disruption, one-parent families, physical handicap, school drop-outs, juvenile delinquency, preventable criminal behaviour and multiple psycho-social economic and family problems associated with many common physical ailments, whose needs are not being met by the existing general practitioner service or by the public or voluntary community agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will get 6 doctors on a feeforservice basis and they will share the functions of family counselling, emergency treatment, immunisation and infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs, through its Northern Territory Division, inherited overall responsibility for the self-help housing scheme from the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> division of the former Northern Territory Administration which as we know was part of the Department of the Interior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence shows that suitable arrangements had not been made by the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Division of the Northern Territory Administration for the delivery and storage of these houses at the settlements and that damage and deterioration had resulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation of at least $3 18m to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing- an increase of $ 1 50m over the amount actually spent in 1973-74- will have a great stimulatory effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, in its own way this is a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is appropriate because in many cases these are <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds and they are designed to go to the area where they are needed most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the methods we have before us, whilst they go part of the way, will not relieve this situation that resulted from the Government’s own actions, which were designed to bring to fruition in the Treasurer’s words the Government’s aims in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing- that is, by stifling private building in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there is no reason why we should discriminate against it especially as, as has been pointed out by many of my colleagues, we are dealing with a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> question- the right of every Australian citizen, regardless of his income, or whether married or single, to have a decent house and to make decisions which are to their advantage and therefore to the advantage of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it was the experience and expertise in the areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and family law possessed by the persons - and bodies that have expressed support for the proposed ground of divorce, as well as the strength of their numbers, that convinced the Attorney-General of the desirability of this reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To protect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the children, who are the real victims of broken marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be attached to the court a specialist staff, notably marriage counsellors and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, to assist the parties at any stage- and even independently of any proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parties will not be driven to the court by their own despair as a last resort; they will be encouraged to come to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and counselling staff of the court whenever they have a matrimonial problem, even if they are not contemplating proceedings of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be a director of counselling and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and such other counsellors and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers attached to the court as are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The director of counselling and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will be required to make the counselling services of the court available to any persons who request it, whether or not they have instituted any proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The counselling and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities of the Australian Family Court would be available to State Family Courts thus created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He or she will merely file a notice in the Family Court, which will bring in the director of counselling and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to turn now to the provisions of the Bill concerning the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children who, as I said before, are the real victims in family disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most significant innovation in the Bill is the provision for a compulsory conference with a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer between the parties to custody or divorce proceedings to discuss the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a child of the marriage, with a view to resolving any points of difference between the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court will also have the power to order supersivion of custody and access orders by <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and where necessary, it will have the power to enforce compliance with such orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a public institution or public fund established and maintained for the comfort, recreation or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of members of the armed forces of any part of His Majesty’s dominions, or of any allied or other foreign force serving in association with His Majesty’s armed forces; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was education, the second was social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the third was health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it has been a serious defect, which persisted until this Government came into office, that there has been a total absence of monitoring the evaluation of the progress of various types of programs in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable members would recognise from what I have said in this House from time to time that this Government has been developing systems of monitoring an evaluation of many of its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and intends to expand this activity to a comprehensive stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commended the Bill because it sought to allow voluntary organisations, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations and people interested in philanthropy to transfer their entitlements and to receive money or assistance from the Government if they had an entitlement under the Aged Persons Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It increased the subsidy or the grant to which these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations were entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation with which I have spoken has supported the stand on this matter by the Opposition in asking for an extension of the Act for another 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill transfers entitlements to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations running aged persons hostels as distinct from aged persons’ homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody in any of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations with whom I have spoken says that it can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister just said, and put doubt into the minds of all <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, that perhaps this working committee of inquiry will recommend against the extension of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is an extension of the policy propounded by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and an extension of the policy outlined by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon),  in his well known Australia Day address on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The importance of these 2 Bills should be looked at in relationship to the Government’s total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program- schemes such as the Australian Assistance Plan, community health centres, child care, recreation and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s method was to combine in one Bill these measures related to voluntary health insurance with certain <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures which have a strong emotive content, including provisions for benefits for handicapped children and for the sufferers of kidney disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the manner in which government is conducted Australia faces a parting of the ways between those who believe that one can go on and on expanding the public sector and those who believe that the constant emphasis upon the use of general taxation revenues and the expansion of the public sector will lead to a collapse of public service such as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree that domestic matters, inflation and unemployment, have a greater priority in our thinking and are more important to the nation ‘s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than any of the matters with which I had to deal overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that unrestricted growth could eventually result in a situation where a union’s officials cease to have rapport with the union’s members and lose awareness of their needs and aspirations, where the energy and devotion of union officials could become absorbed in the material advancement of their union as an institution to the detriment of its members ‘ <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here I must pause and single out for special mention the Royal Australian Air Force aircrews and maintenance staff who kept their planes flying continuously; the RAAF medical teams who did not falter in their duties; the Navy disaster force which hurriedly assembled for duty, brought needed supplies and swung immediately into action bringing urgently needed assistance and undertaking unpleasant tasks often during times of supplementary volunteered duty; the Army which currently is undertaking a similar task as that of the Navy in the same spirit of commitment; the journalists who reported objectively the situation that Darwin faced; the churches which organised relief efforts through their own social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies; the people who organised funds for those financially wanting to help the people of Darwin; the personnel of Qantas Airways Ltd, Ansett Airlines of Australia, Trans-Australia Airlines, Connair Pty Ltd and SAATAS Pty Ltd, as well as members of the general aviation industry who collected together to make the great evacuation program a success; the men and women of the Royal Air Force, the United States Air Force and the Indonesian Air Force who contributed magnificently; the people down the track from Darwin who gave food and shelter to road evacuees; the personnel of the Commonwealth and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, in certain quarters, will be aware of those objections and I would suggest respectfully to the Minister, who has the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Northen Territory at heart, that upon reflection the validity of the points made by the Opposition in this debate, as well as the objections put forward, should meet with Government acceptance and would make this a better Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, I am convinced from the experience of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers that it is far better for children to a broken marriage to be reasonably content with one parent and to see the other occasionally than to be tormented by the strain of living with 2 parents who find that they are not compatible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the separation of Family Court matters from those courts which necessarily deal with criminal offences; the provision for divorce proceedings to be conducted in closed court; the emphasis on the paramountcy of the child’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in custody proceedings; the attempts to improve counselling and reconciliation faculties; the proposals for a continuing study of matters affecting family stability, the working of divorce law and legal aid- provided, of course, this study is conducted in a genuinely representative way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I challenge it to state unequivocally whether abolition of the means test is or is not one of the casualties of the rather massive public expenditure cuts which it is proposing as part of its economic administration of this country in which major <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fields, such as education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, urban and regional development, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, hospitals and community health services will all be cut back substantially according to a secret document circulating among a small number of senior members of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if one looks at past policy one will see a curious policy lack; because our predecessors praised home ownership, they entirely neglected any positive rental policy in the non-<span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, leaving private enterprise to struggle on as best it can in the provision of rental dwellings as a despised second best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this, that subject to proper and satisfactory arrangements being made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children, and particularly if there are no children, what adult people do is primarily a matter for themselves as long as they do not break the criminal law, do not offend their neighbours and are not guilty of breaking the law of torts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Social Security, in answer to a question a little while ago about pensions, referred to what was obviously a report in the ‘Australian Financial Review’ last week of an interview with me concerning social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These conciliation and arbitration measures are vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That’s because Medibank, like other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, will be financed by money from tax revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, appropriations amounting to $225,260,000 are sought to give effect to the arrangements agreed upon at the Premier’s Conference on 14 February for the provision of additional funds to the States to assist employment and to meet certain other commitments for financial assistance to the States, particularly in respect of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, the Tasman Bridge and other disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An additional $65m is being provided for payment to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing activities under the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the additional $6 5m now provided, the total allocation to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1974-75 will reach $375m, an increase of $156m over the 1973-74 allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he receive advice from the former Minister for Immigration that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of Immigration to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, information, education and the issue of passports <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time, despite the absence of an office of the former Department of Immigration a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> team comprising social workers and bi-lingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers speaking the languages of the major migrant groups operates in the Parramatta area as the need arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a company’s shares stand at close at their par value on the marketshareholders, like investors, are loath to pay 50c for an item if they can get it for 45c- both the company’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and even possibly the directors job may require that shares stand at a healthy premium on the market if the new issue of capital is to be raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their role is properly in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing has been built by the housing commission but there has not been this particular type of low rental housing that the legislation before us provides for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in the need area, that of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, the Minister, in his speeches but certainly not in the Bill, is abdicating responsibility for providing that form of housing- except in the sense that the Commonwealth will make moneys available to the State housing authorities, and those funds are welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The low income earner has been protected by the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and by schemes such as that instituted in my own State of Western Australia by the State Liberal-Country Party Government to provide support in hardship cases and of course there is limited financial capacity on the part of State governments to provide for all hardship cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The low income earners, the people who need <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing- hardship cases- have been provided for in these hard times of high interest rate policy but it is the middle income earner who has been caught in the squeeze and there is nothing in this legislation that the Corporation can do to assist those middle income earners who are already buying their home and who are caught by the continuing high interest rate policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That agreement has led, I believe, to the construction of about 280 000 homes, mainly for those in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indictment of the previous Government that no national policy such as this was introduced earlier, but now those income groups above a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> level but not in a high enough income bracket to be able to fend easily for themselves are offered a new opportunity to protect their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill has been denounced as unchristian, a marriage breaker, a nation destroyer, one which neglects the rights and obligations of women and men and the rights and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have completely ignored clause 114 which allows an appeal to a court before proceedings commence so that she may bring about an injunction for physical protection, mental protection or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> protection for herself or the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Likewise, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the family depends on that relationship and not simply on the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The future of the children of a broken marriage needs consideration by the best possible tribunal assisted by the skills of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers and other counselling staff wherever needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fault should rightly be removed from the basis of divorce proceedings, but it is impossible for the court not to consider needs and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> without it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill outlines the principles of the family court- not the old court which was highly legalistic and argumentativebased on reasonableness, discussion and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principles, and takes into consideration the needs of each member of the family and their capacity to contribute to continuing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> outside that existing marital relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when we consider the needs of people rather than the legalistic rights of people, and base those rights on needs and contribution, that we can say we are preserving marriage, not as an outmoded institution but as a family unit of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which will lead to a better and stronger nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are provisions for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children and a requirement that proper arrangements are to be made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children before divorce becomes absolute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This brings me to the next 2 fundamental provisions of the proposed legislation- Parts VII and VIII relating to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children and to maintenance and property, which are the 2 areas where so much litigation now takes place and Part IV relating to family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passage of time and the Standing Orders for debate prevent me from expressing my opinions on each of these matters, but I do want to say something about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children, the family court and the proposed amendment to Parts VII and VIII of the Bill which should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proceedings with respect to the custody or guardianship or access to a child of a marriage the Family Court shall, under clause 64, have regard to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child as of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court will take a more active part than under the present law in supervising arrangements for the custody and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a child, and a support staff of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers will be provided and will be available to the court to assist both the court and the children who are subject to custody orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My continuing worry in relation to the power and operation of the Family Court is to ensure that its decrees and orders, particularly with regard to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children and maintenance of property, are observed and that responsibility for compliance with and observation of the court’s decrees remain a function of the court itself, or one of its agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> workers have their place, but there is no substitute anywhere for parents, home and the love and affection which may come from a well adjusted and well organised home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that the Family Court, which I concede may need looking at from time to time, shall have regard to the need to protect the institution of marriage and family life generally, the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and the means available to assist parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation and the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis placed on the paramountcy of a child’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in custody proceedings is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member listens to what the benevolent organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and many others which have an orientation towards social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters have to say, he wil come to understand that there is a need to provide this faculty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been called for especially by the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> oriented bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1970 the South Australian Council of Social Services conducted a survey through the various social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies on what was termed ‘emergency housing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result a priority housing assistance scheme was established and a referral system devised in agreement with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said in my second reading speech, there are a number of people outside the scope of the present <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing assistance programs run by the States who are unable to make satisfactory financial arrangements to purchase a dwelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Second there is a tendency for even the most representative organisation to become inward-looking and to get out of touch with the people whose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> it is supposed to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But to return to this Appropriation Bill, this is a very clear and tangible expression by this Australian Government of its concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of thousands of my own electors, some 45 per cent of them, who have been so severely hit by this bridge disaster and the consequences that followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twenty-three of his friends, a newspaper announced, had persuaded him to do this so he could devote more time to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of NSW, a task of dedication that was already placing a great strain on him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As passed by the Senate, the major provisions of the Family Law Bill provide for the establishment of a family court in Australia for the first time; the establishment of State family courts for the first time; the ability to seek matrimonial relief in the family courts, the State supreme courts or the magistrates courts without first proceeding for divorce; the abolition of all fault grounds for divorce; joint custody of children and joint responsibility for their maintenance; widely increased use of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to help in custody disputes and in the ongoing relationship between parents; the financial responsibility of each party to a marriage and to maintain the other; criteria for the provision of maintenance for spouses and children based on the applicant’s need; the establishment of a family law council and an institute of family studies; and greatly increased counselling opportunities relating not merely to divorce and reconciliaton but also to the on-going problems of divorced persons, particularly in relation to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the BUI governing the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, maintenance and custody of children are important because the protection of children is probably the strongest justification for intervention by the state to regulate the dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existing law prevents a divorce decree from becoming final until the court is satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the children so does the BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to continuing these measures and introducing uniformity where the existing law is State or Territory law, the Bill contains some additional provisions such as those for separate legal representation of children in proceedings, enforcement of custody and access orders and greater use of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But much of this increase, like that on pensions and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education- much more than half of the total- was essential if the poorer members of the community were to be kept up with inflationinflation, I remind honourable members, with which the present Government had nothing to do- and if real standards in education were to be maintained, let alone advanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before we look at what assistance they need and what the Opposition is now saying about them, let us look at some of the hopes to which honourable members opposite have referred that the Government has raised and consider whether it is a legitimate exercise to raise the hopes of people in Australia and to attract a greater community participation in government enterprises, in government initiatives and in being able to see that government moneys are spent in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is relevant to what the Opposition is saying about Government expenditure in the fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education to bear in mind what the Australian Country Party, with the support of the Liberal Party of Australia, is saying about primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sphere, the present Government has carried on many of the policies which were instituted by us when we were in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat: Which proposition would the electorate choose: Selling $4 billion of Australian assets or printing $ 1,700m in order to make sure that the economy is maintained at a reasonably productive level in order to ensure that the facilities so long denied education, child <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- one can go on- are supplied to the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept, for instance, that pensioners or people dependent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services should be those who should bear an unreasonable burden in the economic management of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it is true that in any system of 1 social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- the honourable member for Hotham is aware of this- there will be a percentage of people who will abuse that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is not so obvious- but what should be clearly understood- is that this is a continuation of the record of the Whitlam Government, to seek out constantly new ways of making a life of dignity for those who receive any form of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then not only has the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system been rationalised; benefits and pensions have increased at a far greater rate than increases in prices and wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I could go on citing these striking examples of the Whitlam Government’s continued progress in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and how this contrasts with the inactivity of the Liberal-Country Party governments when they were in office for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know full well that the philosophy of this Government is founded on a floor of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that our every effort is towards guaranteeing them the right to a living income that has regard to the cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make the point constructively and sincerely that much of the administration of areas of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, be it unemployment benefits, NEAT applications or other forms of pensions, is in a mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the average person feels that damage is being done in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas particularly in a time of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally people in country areas are of a higher average age than elsewhere and it has been pointed out that unemployment and other problems in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are generally greater in the country than in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major argument against the Government, its attitude to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and its so-called concern with the ordinary Australian is none of the points that I have made, valid though they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what this Government does by this Bill or any other piece of legislation, the overall result of the Government’s actions to ordinary Australians is a dangerous reduction in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963 the total cost of all expenditures under the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Act was $590m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the increases in this Bill, for all practical purposes, equal the entire cost of the pension program as recently as 7 years ago and the entire cost of all Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Act benefits as recently as 12 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly and more uncomfortably, the sheer scale of the finance involved again serves to remind us that social security accounts for such a large proportion of Commonwealth expenditure and the growth of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure represents such a large proportion of growth overall that it is impossible to ignore social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as an aspect of the more general economic debate in which the Parliament is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> debate provides a useful and appropriate occasion to take the matter at least one small stage further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should ask ourselves, for a start, whether social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs have any role to play as part of the general case for wage restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In company with my friend from Lilley I hold the view that the problems which are coming up and which must be dealt with in the Budget for 1975-76 are problems which will affect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians, and in their direct capacities they must be able to withstand the impact of the policies that will be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission in its report entitled ‘Project Care- Children Parents Community’ put greater emphasis on the urgent need for good quality custodial care and other childhood services, especially for those in greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As pointed out by the paper on family <span class="highlight">welfare</span> published by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, Australia lacks a coherent family policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt my area already has similar <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This situation, for that matter, applies to any area of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Use could be made of a police and citizens <span class="highlight">welfare</span> club which stands idle all day or of a disused community building such as a shire office, a fire station or like buildings of a semi-industrial or office nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face it, in the past the State housing commissions, particularly in Western Australia, have been prone to erect homes over large areas without providing for community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In October 1972 the Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Grants Act was passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was followed by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report of July 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reports were directed at trying to overcome the very real problems which were faced both by the Fry committee and by the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 2 years living in Israel I had the opportunity of seeing at first hand the effective operation of a well integrated system of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations under the control of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, this will create a number of major problems as the Prime Minister’s Department to date has had little, if anything, to do with the areas of specific education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which are obviously the 2 major fields related to pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is of the view, and will certainly carry it into effect when we return to the Treasury bench, that there should be established a Children’s Bureau which will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers who will retain responsibility for the administration of programs within their respective portfolios such as those of health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Children’s Bureau will act as a collector of information and a disseminator of trends and information to the Departments of State responsible for various aspects of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer the Government to reject the recommendations of the Priorities Review Staff on administration and adopt those put forward by the expert working party of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important factor which we need to emphasise, however, is that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs at this level must emphasise the need for local participation at the grass roots level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That emphasis was towards the establishment of a government which was representative of the people and which took responsibility for the growth of the people and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was, however, some criticism of the report to the effect that it had concentrated on the educational aspects of pre-school services and had neglected to deal with adequate provision for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or custodial-type day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It depends very heavily on skilled and expert knowledge in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statistics that are uncovered and reported in the report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission for 1972-73 are worth considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters relating to adoptions fall within the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> responsibility of State and Territorial administrations, consequently the answer to the right honourable member’s question has been delayed because of the necessity to obtain the information from those sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>b) Due to the priority that had to be given to the development and implementation of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act and related measures affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of handicapped people, no special procedure has been developed as yet for Government contracts to be awarded to sheltered workshops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s initiative springs from its concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We feel that, under the Constitution, we have the right to make provision for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the present interim committee includes people who are interested in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work, people from every State who are virtually working in close consultation with the various State departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An amount of $185,000 is included for the establishment, development and conduct of an associate diploma course in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> studies at North Brisbane College of Advanced Education, Caulfield Institute of Technology and the South Australian Institute of Technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was talking about the crisis in the building industry and about pumping money into State housing authorities for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Government is maintaining <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing as its top priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postscript is not quite so healthy because the Master Builders Association of New South Wales, in the article to which I referred, said that there is a shortfall of $ 18m in loan funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing by the New South Wales Housing Commission and this has meant that the programmed additional 6000 houses will be reduced to 5000, and that is not quite the same way as the Minister put it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Housing is vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and happiness of the individual family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government preens itself on what it terms its dedication to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For them Labor’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dream has become a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> nightmare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become increasingly obvious with the development of modern technology, the changed way and pace of life and the increasing acceptance on all sides of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state that there has been increasing government involvement in the citizens’ daily life and a dramatic expansion of the Executive ‘s power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at the ramifications of the Government’s proposed social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the AMP Society, the largest of the life societies in Australia, is conducting a campaign against the whole social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals, not only of this Government but also of previous governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the insurance industry, through its leaders, is now undertaking a program against the whole of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which the Australian people enjoy or which they expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It presented a case for an expanded chaner to the Senate standing committee on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-During the second reading debate it was unfortunate that the gag had to be applied to someone who knows something about the life assurance industry, someone who has made his living as a salesman in that field and someone who had the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the policy holders of the company for which he worked at heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see it as an intrusion into the rights of the individual who has a right of free choice to protect his life’s savings and his <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in his declining years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, let us dispense with this mockery of the Government’s when it says that it is caring for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the procedure allegedly adopted on environmental matters, on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters and on matters concerning the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Millions of Australians now rely on the life insurance industry for their long-term security and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on offering the Australian people more and more in the way of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and making them more and more dependent upon government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not understand that this strategy has led to the weakening and undermining of the whole private enterprise structure on which our prosperity and all our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs are based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not realise that if we allow the productive base of our society to be damaged by this Government, we are allowing our chances of a better standard of living and real advances in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to be damaged also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Mutual Provident Society’s pre-printed message cards to Federal members urging a ‘modifying of this Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs’ are in reality a campaign urging a reduction in unemployment and sickness benefits, age, invalid and widow pensions, a postponement of the abolition of the means test for age pensions and an attack on all less privileged people who receive any kind of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Social Security seen draft letters circulated by the Australian Mutual Provident Society to its employees urging them to write to members of Parliament attacking what it describes as ‘luxury social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were obliged to admit that those considerations had to be included when one looked at the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children and appropriate amendments to that effect were made during the course of the Senate’s deliberations on the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The amendment to be proposed by the AttorneyGeneral in regard to the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer’ seeks to insert after ‘children’, the words ‘being an organiation that has been approved by the Attorney-General ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would ask honourable gentlemen to take into account as well that there are any number of qualified people in the community who might not satisfy the test of having been a judge, or having been enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court of Australia or of a supreme court of a State or a Territory for not less than 5 years, who would be suitable through experience in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work, counselling work or social work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to ‘the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage’, ‘the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society’, the responsibility for the care and education of dependent children, ‘the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’, and ‘the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not give those concessions to the industry because we liked the insurance companies; we gave them because we wanted to encourage saving and to encourage people to make provision for their own cover and for their own protection in order to relieve the Government of the need to make available some of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions it would otherwise have to make available and to assist in the raising of loan funds for government, commerce and industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there are any members of the Treasury here tonight, particularly, as I said earlier, those who are interested in economic affairs, they would know of the report that was released yesterday by the Australian Institute of Applied Economics and Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, located in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had hoped today that I would have been able to ask the Treasurer  (Dr J. F.

    <p>Public benevolent institutions- and these include many institutions that look to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of blind persons- are entitled to exemption from sales tax on goods purchased for their use and not for resale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a general principle, concessions granted through the taxation system are regarded as being an inefficient and inequitable way of providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that the Australian Government has a mandate for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has been accused of spending too much, particularly on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the simple fact of the matter as everybody knows is that more has been done for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiaries under this Government than was done under any previous government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But at the same time we are getting various calls not only in the matter of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> but also in relation to education, primary producers, secondary industry, the promoting of exports, the building of houses and in the alleviating of problems of those people who suffer from natural disasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest gift that all Australian Labor Party members could give this nation would be to give up their seats, but I do not see them rushing in to make what would be their sole valuable contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It proposes to cut <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education expenditure; it would encourage Australia to be involved in another war in South-East Asia; and it would destroy national government by referring national responsibilities to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter whether this Government is concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of primary industry or not, it should have the courtesy to reply to a telegram sent to one of its Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly one could fairly say that this in itself represents a form of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is now its proposition that there should also be a substantial commitment through the Budget to this sort of financial outlay, which involves a very large amount of money, I repeat the challenge to the Opposition: If that is the sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program it wants, where is it going to get the money and at whose expense in terms of cuts in programs affecting the rest of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that all the initiatives in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field had come in actual fact from the Australian Labor Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So these social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits- pensions to the aged, the disabled, deserted mothers and their dependants, unemployment benefits and sickness benefits- were increased in proportion to what the nation could actually afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to stress this point: The Opposition in government has intentions to provide for those people who are in need not to create a giant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the dangers of the massive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs that are, as I see them, the aims of the Labor Government, is that they will tend to create in this nation people who do not care or who do not have any incentive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Petrie mentioned that there are very many lazy people in our community who are taking advantage of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services that this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are provisions in the Bills for the further funding of the Deakin University at Geelong, for the establishment of a central office of the State College of Victoria, for the establishment of diploma courses in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> studies at one or two colleges of advanced education and for the further expansion of the study centre of the Albury-Wodonga centre of the Riverina College of Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is sour because the Labor Government makes positive decisions and has made more positive decisions for the benefit and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the wool industry in 2 years than the Country Party-dominated coalition government did in 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question earlier this week, the Minister stated that Government support for the reserve price scheme for wool was a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment to wool growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister say which other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes of the Government require repayment of the funds provided and have an interest rate of at least 1 1 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the rather general way in which one talks about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> support programs, that is a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> support program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern- I repeat this because it is an important factor which I want to stress- is that in an endeavour to get a balanced budget, or close to a balanced budget, the Commissions will reduce those services which are not profitable to them without regard to the contribution made by the less densely populated areas; and without regard to the national prosperity through increases in gross domestic product and the increase in national export earnings which, in themselves, are essential to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the prosperity of Australia and, through that, to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I fear for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of my electorate of Stirling because I fear that the coming Budget will be a harsh one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that fruit has now gone bad and the people of Australia at last have woken up to the fact that we cannot buy for example, better education simply by spending more money; we cannot buy all the other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, which of course we want to have and which any government would want to give to the people, unless the people, through their taxation, are able to carry the cost and the economy is able to carry the expenses involved in such policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Australian Automobile Association considers that the proceeds of the 22.3c a gallon tax on petrol should be allocated solely for the use of highways and roads, will he consider an extra tax for motorists to pay for the deaths of 3500 Australians killed on Australian roads and for the costs that some 90 000 Australians injured on our roads each year impose upon public hospitals, workers compensation and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The views of Professor Henderson and of many other worthy people who are involved in and committed to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field and who have expressed their concern about the less well off in our community were vastly influential in the decision-making which resulted in the personal tax measures announced last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Housing and Construction aware of Press reports of the criticism by the New South Wales Minister for Housing of the Budget allocations for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that New South Wales will receive from the Budget this financial year only $90m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, what is the allocation to New South Wales for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the current Budget, and what was the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the last full year of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well appreciate the honourable gentleman’s concern about the reports because I suppose that nobody has illustrated greater concern for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing than he has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New South Wales will receive for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in this financial year an amount of $123,41 1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the criticism of this Government’s provision for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing has come about as a result of an increase of 122 per cent in the amount actually allocated as compared with 1971-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Australian Government advanced amounts to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing that were consistent with their capacity to spend the funds; in other words, every cent that they could spend was allocated to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973-74 the New South Wales Government had to carry over an amount of $ 17m which had been allocated for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing because it did not have the capacity or the ability to spend it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Government has shown over a period of time that it has severely neglected the people in need of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, particularly in respect of community services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become clear that the Arab bloc- the greatest beneficiaries, along with the Third World nations, of UN aid and expertise- is willing to risk destruction of the specialised agencies even if this means depriving millions of people, including its own, of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, educational and other direct assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That also includes the responsibility for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, morale, discipline and personnel under his control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government acknowledges that those who have put forward these views have been motivated by genuine feelings of concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Timorese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition we believe that beef producers, like any other section of the community which has lost its means of livelihood, should be eligible for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, which even this Government denies them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the present Government has not adopted this course of action and we must accept the continuing high growth of government spending at the expense of the real <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $406m of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing or $306m of educational building is engaged in, as is provided for in this Budget, are there no private builders who are employed in these constructions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it enable or induce the private sector to turn its attention once again to growth, development and new horizons, with all that that means in terms of providing jobs for Australians and a higher standard of living and the very capacity the better to meet those aspirations in the education, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, defence and other fields where community demands have outrun the ability to provide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and national development programs presented to the people in 1972 were predicted on the promise of a 6 per cent or 7 per cent growth rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody could criticise the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments which are being made to people who are in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system has evolved and will continue to evolve but it is the one which we have now and it is the one which will provide a larger gross domestic product from which social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs may be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means adopted is that which underlies the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state in Britain and is really a form of outmoded government paternalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state mentality is irrelevant in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old-fashioned <span class="highlight">welfare</span> mentality with its paternalism and centralism has usefully focused public attention upon economic and political philosophies relevant to the last quarter of the twentieth century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing but did not mention the amount of the reduction in expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public housing or so-called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing allocations in the Budget have been reduced by $69m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some time before the Budget the Minister for Housing and Construction announced that there would be no cutback to the States for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cutback in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing therefore will affect very seriously those on low incomes and those presently without accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> advances to the States is to assist in this area, and the reduction in these advances in the Budget has meant that the housing commissions will be unable to continue at the same rate to build housing or rental accommodation for low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing is an area to which the Government attaches high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will also be some 2% times greater than the allocations for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing from State loan funds in the last 2 years of the previous Government which were $16 1.5m in 1971-72 and $ 163.2m in 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the real measure of the importance attached to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing by the present Government in comparison with our predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to limit the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advances for 1975-76 to the 1974-75 level has been a difficult one for the Government to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was appropriate for public housing activity to be stepped up above the original allocations in order to increase the output of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and also to use resources that otherwise may well have remained idle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the allocations for 1975-76 are limited by the budgetary constraints aimed at achieving greater economic stability and the control of inflation, they by no means reflect an intention to divert from a course that will ensure further improvements in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, although it may not be possible to maintain commencement of government dwellings at the same level as in 1974-75, the still substantial advances to be provided in 1975-76 will allow the completion by the State housing authorities of a much higher number of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dwellings than has been the case for many years and this will be occurring along with the recovery in private housing now in train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Treasurerwill be authorised to continue payments to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the period from 1 July 1976 until an appropriation measure for 1976-77 is passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for people who live in Griffith, Leeton, Narrandera, Deniliquin, Hay and West Wyalong as well as in most other towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the difference is that the priorities of the Labor Party and the Government lie in the area of quality of life, in the area of education, in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and in the area of community health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government that it look at some of the articles that have been published dealing with its own social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and the comments of people like Professor Downing on its proposals for compensation schemes and expenditure on a national superannuation scheme and on whether we can justify that sort of expenditure when there are other people in the community with real needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provides a clear indication to young Australians that this Government has a concern for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that it will not put a mortgage on their future opportunities just to solve our present economic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want to be rude, but the speech of the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)  was just crammed full of meaningless generalities, such as the statements that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> must be paid for and that the health scheme is not free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member said that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> must be paid for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They want a fortune to be pumped into companies, they want social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to be improved and they want government spending to be cut, but when we ask them to get down to the kernel of the matter and provide details as to what they would do they are not able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I outlined to the House before, because of the contingencies which arose and because of the shocking neglect of 23 years of ineffectual government before we came to power, the amount of spending in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and urban development areas in particular had to be massive; the expenditure outlays had to be massive to overcome the anomalies that were present in the Aus.tralian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a compromise between competing loyalties- our loyalties to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people and our concern for the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had desired on the one hand to maintain its program to increase social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and on the other hand to meet the urgent need to curb inflation and unemployment and at the same time to stabilise the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lack of response now surely brings into question whether we should continue to subordinate our aims regarding the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people to big business priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s insistence on exploiting inflation to finance its extravagant social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs will lead inevitably to the movement of income earners to high tax brackets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What concerns me is the lack of perspective about the role of public spending in promoting the increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our community as shown in the responses of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year, 1974-75, much of the increase in public spending against the economic cycle was on increased employment benefits, the Regional Employment Development scheme, finance for housing paid through the banks, some $ 150m paid as special advances, an increase in the expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing between 1973-74 and last financial year of $200m, the payment of a loan of more than $400m to the Australian Wool Corporation, and the extra money provided to the States for employment purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition has clearly indicated that the Opposition’s intention if it ever came to government would be to restrict and to reduce <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In hospital and health care in the central coast electorate of Robertson over $6m has been spent in education it has been $3m; in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> $1,650,000; in seen and telecommunications work almost $3m; in sport and recreation facilities $2.3m; in tourism $3.3m, with the acquisition of shares in the Old Sydney Town project; in major drainage works $1.5m; curbing, guttering and footpath paving- a lot of these projects carried out through the Regional Employment Development scheme- in excess of $lm; in water reticulation, $1,124,000; and in recreation, council parks and gardens, nearly $700,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great paradox of socialist governments is that, from the time they assume power, they undermine the foundations of the private enterprise sector and deprive themselves of their capacity to implement their expensive social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its fundamental tenet supposedly is the freedom of the individual, but it is highly noticeable that in its application it would not only preserve but also would greatly extend the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and influence of the most privileged sections of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There can be no denying that the Fraser philosophy is more concerned with corporate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, more concerned with preserving the economic system than with preserving the people it victimises, more concerned with the promotion of selfish acquisitive values than with the humanitarian values such as concern for one’s fellow-man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relatively low incidence of direct taxation in Australia was reflected in government expenditure on such items as education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, or was until this Government came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a scathing attack on Australia ‘s appalling disregard for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the London  Financial Times  of 10 March 1971 showed that the proportion of Australia’s gross domestic product expended on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was appallingly low in comparison with other developed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His program, in order to have any semblance of economic responsibility, would have to tear the heart out of the Government’s education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and urban development and recreation programs that are designed to provide equality of opportunity, income security, good health and a more pleasant environment for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it has been hell bent on centralism and duplicating almost every social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program which exists in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of what he- had to say is very vague, but millions of people who have been aided by Labor’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education programs would, in my view, have a lot to worry about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have also been great increases in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to meet the ravages of poverty that exist in our community and that are inflicted chronically- not just for a time- on one and a quarter million people if we are to believe the survey on poverty which the Opposition, when in government, reluctantly set up at our behest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to public expenditure and is opposed to Government intervention in the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Budget Speech the Treasurer proudly said that since coming to office the Government had taken a great stride forward in the field of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that now it must take stock of its progress and consolidate its gains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suggestion I have made no doubt will conflict with the ambition of the Government to create a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> State where the majority of the people are dependent on handouts from a socialist government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out, there are areas in which we could cut the Budget expenditure further in the non-productive areas without affecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what the people opposite say about our not being interested in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> my Party will introduce a system of automatic increases on a twice-a-year basis fixed on a proper system so that there will be no way that the people will miss out on the amount they are entitled to get as a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We aim to curb it, but we do not aim to throw away the great program of reform and change that this Government introduced into our community starting in 1972- the programs we have been following through steadily since in education, in community health, in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 23 July 1975 the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Government had decided to initiate a special survey of Vietnamese refugees who had settled recently in Australia He announced that the survey would take approximately 5 years, would be conducted by  Dr Jean  Martin of the Australian National University and would encompass such things as the refugees’ reasons for leaving their own country; their social characteristics; their aspirations in their new homeland; what Australian Government assistance in maintenance and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> they requested, or needed and received; the problems they thought they might have to face in settling in Australia and how these compared with the problems actually encountered; the problems of culture and language difference that they had to face; what happened to their cultural identity in the process of resettlement; and to what extent, if at all, they suffered from racism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Kelso plan is completely the reverse because it enables individuals to rely on private <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; that is, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which they can provide for themselves during their working life, and after that in retirement, from the second income they may earn by sharing the ownership of the productive enterprises of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the economy continues its downward trend, there is every expectation that unemployment will increase and, therefore, the requirement for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments in particular will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more in keeping with the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives and programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more important- good roads or the arts, the alleviation of poverty or increasing the bureaucracy, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing or payments of $120 a week to unemployed Regional Employment Development scheme workers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to speak first of all about 3 features of the Budget, namely, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and the taxation proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, so often denigrated by our opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have such a brilliant record in this field that they should be embarrassed even to mention the words ‘social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program in which total direct outlays on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are estimated to increase from $3,703m in 1974-75 to $4,772m in 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Quorum formed)  I thank you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  and I also thank the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier)  for lowering the curtain on Act I. I was referring to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program of the Government and the absence of any statement by the Opposition on what its attitude would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore direct outlays on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in 1975-76 will be equivalent to 21.8 per cent of the estimated total Budget outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members would be fascinated by the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition to pensions and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include an equitable distribution of the nation’s wealth, an optimum rate of growth, a healthy balance of payments and a concern with the quality of life or community <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The alternative Budget proposals of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  show that he has a concern neither for accuracy nor for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> considerations we must ask which measures- the Government’s Budget or the Opposition’s proposals- are more likely to stimulate the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  who has just spoken, talks of poverty and the Henderson inquiry yet will not admit that the roots of that poverty he in the 23 years of Liberal neglect of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One could go on with many examples, but the people would prefer the Opposition to come clean and to own up to where it would make the cuts in government spending which provides the community <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government spending on hospitals, schools and roads, government purchases and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments ends up in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the speech on the 1973 Budget I identified inflation as being the product of deliberate policy by the Government because this was a government which was feeding off inflation, financing its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> out of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have then is a conversion from dependence on public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to individual responsibility for private <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further to that the Government has established offices of the Department of Social Security, offices of the Department of Labor and Immigration, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> offices and community centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is needed in Hobart now are not ferries, terminals, new telephones and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Sherry)  so proudly enumerated, but a bridgeeither a temporary bridge, repairs to the old bridge or a newly constructed bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the work of these men a community health service has been provided, an office of the Department of Social Security has been established, new roads have been put in to service the area- I will deal with the Old Beach Road at a later stage and will tell the House just what did occur in regard to that road- grants have been made to the Clarence Council, an office of the Department of Labor and Immigration has been set up as well as Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is need for a reallocation of the work of parliamentarians, for more committees of the Parliament and less social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and diplomatic work in the community by parliamentarians unless further aid is forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has a long history of public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities and, I believe, of mobilising the nation, often in good causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We feel that there is a need for a stronger and better sustained medical research effort in Australia for economic as well as humanitarian and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, when Opposition members have to debate a specific issue- whether it be medical research, defence, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, education or anything else- they say that we should have given more money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is division 873 and refers to assistance for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing under the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at that advance and at the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  it is quite clear that the Budget Speech indicated that the advances to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing were to be kept at the same level as they were in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind both of those facts, the Advance to the Treasurer and the Budget Speech which reflected the advance for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, an error has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened clearly is that for this year the $ 10.4m has been taken off the advances to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In campaigning in that election, he said that the Queensland Government was assured of a blank cheque for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for all those contracts that it could let. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>8m from the amounts available to the States in respect of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States in terms of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing commitment of this Government What has happened is that well over 2500 fewer homes will be able to be built as a result of the subtraction of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there has been a double subtraction of that amount from the amount due to the States in toto for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no significant upturn in housing activity which would compensate for what is to be done in the public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances which require that there be no reduction even of the money amounts for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, I believe, are rather overwhelming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister will find, if the bookkeeping is analysed, that an error has been made which can have quite grievous consequences for those people on low incomes who require <span class="highlight">welfare</span> homes, housing commission homes, and home builders’ account advances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are things like payments to the States and payments out of the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund which are automatically appropriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been calculated that in 1967 there was one Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker for every 70 Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of us (Lovejoy) has estimated that, if the 1973-74 expenditure on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of $1 1 7.4m had been given directly to Aboriginals (estimated to be 140 000), there would have been about $838.00 for every man, woman and child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the process, it is becoming a lucrative business- for professional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, administrators, researchers and consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During his period in Parliament, the Minister has been active in many areas of social reform including housing, health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it should be stated that there has been criticism that increases in the number of departmental staff have led to a lucrative business for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers and administrators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report tided ‘Rural Poverty in Northern New South Wales’ by the Poverty Commission of Inquiry noted that if the 1973-74 expenditure on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of $1 17.4m had been given directly to Aborigines, then estimated at 140 000, it would have meant $838 for every man, woman and child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs must not be allowed to become a lucrative business either for professional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, researchers or consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the unfortunate aspect of this approach is that it seems to generate a greater resentment towards Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have tended to cut back on the material services but we have maintained and not cut back our priorities for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and projects concerned with physically handicapped people, hostels for young people, women’s refuges and programs of this type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is in connection with the appropriation by the Government for what is erroneously, I think, described as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should not like anybody in this Government to say to anybody in the Australian Capital Territory that this Government is spending more on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or government housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way I work it out is that in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory there will be a loss of 600 dwellings this year in the so-called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He should look at the situation of people on low incomes who are waiting for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the previous Government neglected any social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year, we made available approximately $370m and we have made available a similar amount again this year to try to catch up the backlog of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for those people on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that people in defence service homes are getting a good deal, particularly those who have been on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> homes list for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think I can give his assurance as well as mine that whilever he is Minister he Will see that the people’s interests are protected, in contrast to what people like the honourable member for Lilley- a future Minister for Transport in the far distant timemight do, and that is put profits before the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, when the Opposition was in Government it never faced up to the problem of rural poverty and rural <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact he is on public record in 2 speeches as having guaranteed the States that their allocations for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing would not be cut back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advances by the Australian Government for the States’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs will not be less than in the previous financial year - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think in those short words in this Estimates debate I have shown the vital significance of the policy of interdependence for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia’s overseas trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The speech of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in response to the Budget Speech proposed the lifting of these levies and the payment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to beef producers in critical financial situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition’s system would lead to duplication and waste and to no advance at all in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 18 February 1973 the proposed establishment of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was announced by the then Minister for Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Victorian Government this year will receive the same total amount of funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing as it received last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I contrast that with the $36.5m which was handed over to it in 1 97 1 -72- the last full year of the Lib- - eral Country -Party Government -Y-et-the-.fact_ that  Mr Dickie  has received for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Victoria an increase of $6 1.6m in comparison with 1971-72 apparently eludes him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the official recognition of that view by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which has pleased many concerned members of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was with sincere regret that we heard the recent statement made in the Senate by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Wheeldon)  in which he announced, in response to the recommendations in the Coleman report, that the Government could not afford any significant reforms or developments in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> within the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be watching with great interest when the Opposition’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy is tabled to see whether the matter which the honourable member raised is included in the policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the items of expenditure which the previous Minister, I presume, recommended and which was agreed to referred to John Paterson Urban Systems Pty Ltd, who were asked to study this question- ‘Time as a social indicator-study of time allocation and preference as an indicator of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not be like this mumbo jumbo that we are fed with about preference as an indicator in a study of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In it the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)  has this to say about our aid policy objectives: they are to promote through social and economic development, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people in developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to have realised that over-using the money pump or the printing presses will not cure <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The dispensing of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> under this Government has been centralist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget gives no indication of the stance or direction of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Henderson Report again clearly documents the failure of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies of this Labor Government and clearly documents over pages and pages of its report the dissatisfaction of recipients of those policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was supposed to be an experiment and a pilot scheme they have made a permanent feature of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and possibly have set back this exciting area of human progress a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have the honour in a few weeks to unveil the Opposition’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these policies will correct the mismanagement and the chaos into which this Government has turned this most important area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medibank will gallop away with such a proportion of gross national product that there will not be sufficient funds available for the other important health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services that the people need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is true that no government would be foolish enough to claim that it is not guilty of mistakes, on the other hand it is absolutely true that we are a trading country which for its economic health is interdependent on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been able to maintain payments also to those in receipt of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits at a rate ahead of the cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Department has direct outlays in the field of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for this year estimated at some $4,772m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Direct outlays on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in 1975-76 are equivalent to 21.8 per cent of the estimated total Budget outlay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that huge responsibility to our genuine areas of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and because of the costs involved, it is most desirable that stringent procedures be developed that remove existing anomalies and also remove the abuses that are being perpetuated in the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that only by close scrutiny can we ensure that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas are supported fully and adequately and can be broadened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I just say in closing my remarks that the success of any social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program is dependent not on the Government but upon the ability of taxpayers to fund the necessary schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the end result of this will be a real improvement in human <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the form of better dental health for the next generation of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not just that we have more dental therapists and it is not just that we have more buildings; the benefit is a tangible one in human <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I discussed this problem with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer at the Dandenong and District Hospital and she showed to me a number of case studies which she had carried out on elderly people in the hospital which demonstrated the desperate plight faced by those people who virtually have nowhere to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will be aware of widespread demands from the Opposition and elsewhere in the community for a curb on the rate of increase of social services and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services provided by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we give these matters high priority- higher priority than any previous government ever gave any of the matters in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things have suddenly come forward and the number of applications for assistance under this wide-ranging program of benefits in capital and recurrent services for not only the handicapped but also generally in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has led to a great upsurge in demand for assistance from the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without our interest in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and in the field of need of the handicapped, the psychiatrically disabled or ill dominating our decision making the Minister for Health would not have undertaken a most extensive program of community psychiatric health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think these innovations have been of great benefit not only to the building industry throughout Australia but also in all fields of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not true that a drastic cutback has been made in advances this year to Victoria for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the entire <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advance this year to Victoria is the same as last year- it is $98. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will the smaller States then make up the amounts which they are going to need for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing if the money will have to be raised through extra taxes by the States themselves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hazard a guess that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing will come a pretty bad last if it is to be left in the hands of the States to raise the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the short time available to me I want to refer to the dishonest approach that has been adopted by the Queensland Government in respect of the amount of funds available to it this year for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government on this occasion this year has also complained that it has not received the same amount of money that it requested for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It asked for a sum vastly greater than that allocated by the Australian Government and complained that Queensland’s position in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in comparison with that of South Australia was such that it was being unfairly treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to see the statistics and to compare the effort made by South Australia in the field of low cost <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing over a great number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland in 1972-73 the total number of dwellings in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field that were completed, under the arrangements of the State housing authority and the home builders account, was 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that year South Australia completed almost three times the number of houses in the low income <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing area than Queensland did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I doubt that the Queensland Government could live up to its claim that it will complete in the vicinity of $80m worth of housing in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government has received a very fair deal in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for Queensland per head of population have increased under this Government from $8, when this Government took office, to over $15 in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is this a justifiable proposition from a government purporting to be concerned with family reunions and with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and successful integration of migrant people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is how the total expenditure was broken up:  Major drainage  works, $1,477,220; kerbing, guttering and minor drainage and foot paving, $1,015,510; water reticulation, $1,124,486; council parks, gardens, reserves and public amenities, $656,327; electricity, $39,021; Gosford hospital and ancillary work, $575,869; <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects, $454,794; servicing the RED scheme, $88,869; miscellaneous, $89,600; and sporting and recreational facilities, $2, 1 54,7 1 4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been of serious concern to those interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House views with concern the failure of the Government to take action to restrict the effect of inflation on people with low incomes receiving superannuation or receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and believes the Government should take urgent action to ensure that these people are not adversely prejudiced by its economic mismanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attention of the Government should be directed also to its lack of action in endeavouring to do what this motion suggests, that is, that the Government should take urgent action to ensure that those people who are dependent on superannuation and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are not adversely prejudiced by the economic mismanagement of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government should take action to restrict the effects of inflation on people on low incomes, people on superannuation and people receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are in many instances in an even worse position than those on superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the amounts paid in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits have increased but it is what those dollars buy that really counts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not a matter of just gradually increasing the actual money value of these payments that are being made to people receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and superannuation payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large scale unemployment brings about the need for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is directly related to the number of people who are forced into receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When these people erode their savings, when they use them up, they simply have to go on to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will involve both direct measures to increase the incomes of.poor people and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to prevent poverty, which should be fitted into a long-term policy for the distribution of the growth of national income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this period of very rapidly rising inflation has the Government even considered trying to restore the purchasing power of the pension by adjusting pensions and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments more regularly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If inflation gets up to around 20 per cent adjustments will have to be more frequent in order to make it possible for recipients to come closer to preserving the real level of income required over a long term for them to have some sort of stability in their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and superannuation payments, but particularly <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there should be no real problem in the Australian Government’s obtaining the funds required to finance <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and to meet their high costs due to inflation because in the economy as a whole money incomes tend to rise rapidly in line with the inflation rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let those people on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and superannuation benefits remember that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Griffith has asked the Government to ‘restrict the effect of inflation on people with low incomes receiving superannuation or receiving <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the level of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments made by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is something that the Opposition must squarely and responsibly face in the near future if it is not to cause not only problems affecting <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment recipients but also problems which will cause the widespread unemployment of people who are employed by government or who are dependent on government purchases and contracts for their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances one would expect that the Opposition Parties would have a better <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy to put in the place of our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would briefly like to cover some ground in respect of the relative performances in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas the increases have been even greater than 80 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that here the Leader of the Opposition has let the cat out of the bag by making repeated statements which clearly show that it is his aim if he ever, God help us, becomes Prime Minister of this country to take government out of the field of providing services and just completely confine any <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activity to transfer payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite clear that the payment of pensions and other benefits is the most important part of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is something to fear in a pernicious doctrine which has now crept into the Liberal Party’s philosophy of the voucher system which has been espoused by the Opposition’s spokesman on education in another place who talks about an education voucher policy and by the honourable member for Hotham who talks about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> vouchers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that if we ever see the day when our political opponents are restored to government they will not allow the Leader of the Opposition to proceed with their absolutely reactionary and archaic policies which would result in a retreat into the 19th century and a reliance on market mechanisms to provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services or any other basic services for people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of my argument will be directed at showing that inflation and inadequate increases in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits are causing intolerable hardships for people in these groupings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the Department of Social Security they include the Australian Assistance Plan funds, which I have already mentioned: the grants to organisations under the Disabled Persons Homes Act, the Handicapped Persons As:sistance Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act: and funds for various community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations such as the Australian Council for Social Service and the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All we have to take into consideration is, firstly, that there would be a federal income tax levy; secondly, there would be a State income tax levy, the amount of which the States would determine; thirdly, there would be another tax for local government; and fourthly, if we can place any credence on the suggestions of the Opposition spokesman on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, there would be a separate tax for Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that the demand for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services grew and the taxable or revenue capacity of the city dropped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill now before the House seeks to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  to make advances to the States for the purpose of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or government housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ‘whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House is of the opinion that the reduction of $20.8m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is a breach of the undertaking given by the Australian Government not to reduce the advances to the States below the 1974-75 level and that many low income families will be needlessly disadvantaged as a result’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no concern for the people who are on low incomes, who are underprivileged or disadvantaged and who will seek what is commonly known as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment deals with the reduction amounting to $20.8m in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the cutback in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, which is what we are talking about today, amounts to $20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2913 on the notice paper which asks whether he had said that advances for the States <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs will not be less than in the previous financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we are saying that in this Budget assistance for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing has been decreased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister said that in 1974-75, the year just ended, advances were 2 ‘A times more than was spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in 1971-72 when we were in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in 1971 when we were in Government we produced 15 337 homes with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> money and this Government has produced only 15 228. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advances by the Australian Government for the States’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs in 1975-76 will not be less than in the previous financial year . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial problems began when the Prime .Minister, at the Premiers’ Conference on 19 June 1975 broke with past practice and declined to disclose the amount of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds being made available to the States, indicating at that time that the details of fund allocations would be announced ‘in the Budget context’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally I have no doubt that he would like to be able to get more funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing but he has some pretty tough nuts to crack in the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 should also say that, in the light of development in the industry as a whole as the year unfolds, including the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds to productive use in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, we stand ready to consult further with the States on the provision of additional advances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Commonwealth Government supported the proposition that we should pull all stops out and spend to the limit of our ability, we are now geared through the Housing Commission to expend Slum a month on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the position is that the State of Victoria now has $ 1 2m left for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and at the rate of $ 10m the State is not going to be able to keep going for very long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing, to use that general term, has probably nowhere else in Australia been promoted as successfully as it has been in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has maintained its spending on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government attaches great importance to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of $364m- it is really $374m- has been allocated for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in accordance with the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is looking for further improvements in the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More money will not cope completely with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government did not even get down to the basic problem or the need for providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been the practice in Victoria that enormous tracts of land are bought by the Housing Commission out of taxpayers money at greatly inflated prices and the only people who make any profit out of this are certainly not the people who should be benefiting from the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing but the developer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much more <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing should be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the past governments, State and Federal, had set their sights on the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in their long terms in office we might now be able to hold our heads up as some of the Scandanavian countries can and say that we can provide housing for those who cannot afford to provide it for themselves and we can provide it at a rent they can afford to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to provide a diversity of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to suit all age groups and all aspects of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as representatives of the Australian electorate should maintain our concentration on making <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is a very sad measure because the Government has decreased in a significant way the amount of funds which it will provide for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be quite clear: The amount of real assistance to housing and to the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, which is only part of the market, has been decreased by an effective  20  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there may be argumentation by the Government that it has in fact kept up the level of assistance in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to States, the States obviously do not feel free enough to be able to keep up the level of approvals at which houses will be commenced and at which houses will be completed as in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there has been a real and a calculated drop in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That scheme, put up by a party bent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, was designed to assist those who built the most expensive houses, who saved the least and who negotiated the highest interest rates on money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense for any government to talk about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and say that it is a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> government when these 2 very basic social obligations have been forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look back at the advances made to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing by the Australian Government we find a dramatic jump in the year 1973-74, the first financial year this Government was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last 2 years’ allocation will be  2lA  times greater than the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing from State loan funds in the last 2 years of the previous Government, which were $161.5min 1971-72 and$163.2min 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are of course, very good reasons why the amount of money allocated for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing this year does not follow the dramatic increases of the past 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can go back to the track record of the previous Government to see what concern it had about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can be fairly sure that one of the casualties would be <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of this, the substantial advances in the 1975-76 financial year will allow State housing authorities to complete more <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dwellings than has been the case for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and time again we have seen that the people who are benefiting from this are the developers and not the people whom we are aiming to help with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing- the poorer people in this community whom we are trying to assist to get homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whole matter of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is of considerable importance to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome this Bill because it approves more than $364m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has the housing problems and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems that unfortunately often attend those communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How were the various objectives emphasised by the Australian Labor Party prior to the 1972 election, and shared by this side of the House, in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, in education, urban development and in assistance to the poor to be achieved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assistance being provided for these refugees in the areas of housing, employment, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and language training is the same as that provided for other non-English speaking new arrivals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The shadow Minister for Social Security and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>,  Mr Chipp,  flew from Canberra to Sydney yesterday to give a press conference because he claimed the Opposition was being gagged and guillotined into silence by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extremely clear to anyone in this Committee that there is a necessity to ensure that if an Aboriginal group of people is to conduct an activity of the kind that is spelt out in the provisions of subclause (3) of clause 1 1- including such things as community amenities, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, garbage collection, roads, relief work, education or training, communications, electricity supply, water supply, sewerage, health and housing- it is our responsibility, since the States are ceding it to us and since we have in any case acquired it as a result of a referendum, to provide legislation which will make certain that such an organisation operates as legal entity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the silent ravages of child malnutrition the Committee considers that all services in the fields of community health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education should be given and should accept prime responsibility to ensure that all children under their notice are receiving suitable and sufficient food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, yesterday I had to reject a proposal that I should allocate a little over $ 1 lm from the Treasurer’s Advance to provide grants for various community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies responsible for providing accommodation for the aged and the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Labor Government will not take the same callous attitude to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia which the Opposition has already demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can he say what is the comparative staffing in the field of other Departments working in social and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fields with Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance to those in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is believed by the Government that voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations are a critically important part of the Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It favours the provision of migrant advisory services and assistance schemes in industry and will encourage industry to take a greater responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrant workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say one thing: Another element is involved in this question- I will deal with it quite separately- and that is that when a government is providing funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing I believe there is some obligation on the Government to do so in a way that will provide the best housing for the greatest number of people and not in a way which, because of the expense involved, will heavily restrict the number of people who can be accommodated in such <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I certainly want to record the long-time and effective interest which the honourable gentleman has shown in matters of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in general and in relation to pensioners in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention only briefly that of course it is the Government’s total objective to put value back into the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar and at the same time to recognise that, so far as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups are concerned, the overriding objective in their interest and that of the balance of the Australian community must be firstly to wind down the present rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a commitment to people in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area who through some misfortune become the have-nots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medibank, pensions, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will all be strengthened by honest responsible government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  said that education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no cutback in the essential areas of education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and assistance to local government, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a waste if a government, in building <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing- in all cases when building <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing the value of the land has to be taken into account; it cannot be excluded- spends sums in excess of that required for the type of home for which one would reasonably expect to provide as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When governments are building <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing they do not have a responsibility to provide luxury waterfront accommodation at a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> rate at the expense of other Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable gentlemen opposite would like to take the sort of approach they are taking now, to provide half the accommodation for the same amount of money, let them come and see some of the people in my electorate who are on waiting lists for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and tell them what they are saying tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reliably informed that the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  the only man in the Government ranks who really understands the issue of health insurance and health services, has washed his hands of any association with debate on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health because of the unfortunate experiences he has had at the rather ruthless hands of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is a special requirement on this side of the House to represent those views in this House, to stress to those people that this is the home of liberalismliberalism with a small L- not the home of authoritarian do-goodery, not the house of determined pressure on the society, where they will do what is good for them whether they like it or not, not the forced enema approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been interested in that field and I have been chairman of the previous Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee for the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As pan of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance to those in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that when one deals with policy questions in the field of social security one has to pay tribute to the Department of Social Security and also, to my mind, to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which was set up by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Government has now announced it will abolish the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Government proposes to abolish the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and therefore  Mrs Marie  Coleman, who is the  Chairman  of that Commission, as I understand it, is left without any sort of recourse against the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important aspect of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, which I would have thought would appeal to the present Prime Minister and the people behind him- it certainly appeals to me, although I do not share many of the Government’s views, but I hold the view, and I am glad that the Government at least expresses the view- that it is important for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar or whatever it might be calledthis applies not only to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> but to education and health etc.- to be spent in the most efficient and the most appropriate manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission did a lot of policy analysis work and I think that work is one of the most important aspects of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is in the form of a speech by  Mrs Marie  Coleman which deals with priorities in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; the other is a social policy reference paper which also includes all the other Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission publications, of which there are many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very attractive to be able to say that we do not want means tests, stigmas and so on attached to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and that therefore we opt for universalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there is a government that has a concern for the creation of wealth, this country will not have the resources to meet the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the compassionate and the developmental requirements which we all would want to see met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I firmly believe that the federalism policy which has been outlined by this Government is one with a great deal of application in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area of our activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my firm belief that local government is capable of undertaking and is eager to adopt the responsibility for more social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs include supporting mothers benefits, handicapped children allowances, grants to community organisations, day care centres, the appointment of social and community planners or child catalysts, local government is the tier of government better able to spend the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar for full value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An electoral system is already established and there is a traditional involvement by people in local government and in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which gives an historical head start to community participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A wholly misconceived strategy for dealing with inflation has become a pretext for attacking public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social reform- the real targets of the Prime Minister’s vengeance and contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members, I put it to you that this coalition Government sitting here today is not one that is concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather it is concerned only with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and interests of those few among us to whom poverty is unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems facing my constituents are common throughout Australia: The care and attention of the aged; the handicapped and the under privileged; a reduction and review of crippling taxes; a reduction of inflation; a return to full employment; a transfer of emphasis from the public to the private sector; the opportunity to own a home; a return to a society based upon freedom in all respects, not a socialist <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Translation and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services for our other ethnic groups were woefully inadequate but for the Turks they were non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that period the Kensington group, which represents a wide spread of Turkish migrants, formed their own social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> group, hired their own premises and conducted a survey of their community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas the cost is important, the health and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation are of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in my view the Government has to adopt a basic position, and that is to ensure, firstly, that the system provides drugs essential to life and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of every person regardless of his financial position, secondly, that pharmaceutical items are of the highest quality- I am sure that the Department of Health has done a tremendous job in that area- thirdly, that they are available at a reasonable price- nobody can claim that the Department of Health has not done a good job in that area- and, fourthly, there is also the necessity for the maintenance of a viable pharmaceutical manufacturing industry which has sufficient resources to carry out research and to keep pace with the needs of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world is well on the way to the acceptance of this profound truth, that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all the people in all lands depends primarily on full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we can see, in any case, is that neocapitalism, with its pretensions to have found the answer to Marx, was the expression of a temporary situation, borne along not by its own dynamic but by the upwards wave of the economic cycle; but the vision of a society dedicated to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, not to power and profit- the only vision that makes sense in today ‘s circumstances- still eludes us, and will do so until another crisis, even more crippling than the crisis that is brewing today, brings home to the whole world the perils it faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also believes that until we begin to think about it we will not solve the problems of dealing with inflation or the problems of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because there is a jack-up on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have thought that by now some of the lessons of the old fashioned, outmoded <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state paternalism would have got through to the Opposition, especially as the Wilson Labour Government has clearly learnt this lesson and is carrying out a very stringent program of across-the-board cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here is the clearest and most far-reaching kind of concept which has so far been ignored by the Opposition, the transferability of staff between the government and the non-government sector, especially in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These tribunals normally consist of two independent members, usually a lawyer and somebody qualified in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, and a person seconded from but not acting for the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, we propose to supplement Consolidated Revenue Fund receipts, and thereby reduce the size of the prospective Consolidated Revenue Fund deficiency, by paying into that Fund unrequired balances held in the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Trust Account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1952 amendment to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Act provided a standing appropriation for the automatic replenishment of the National’ <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Trust Account in respect of any moneys paid from the account for social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, social security and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs may best be administered by local government instead of by the Federal Government or a State government; it may well be that programs conducted by State or local government could best be conducted federally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the special considerations they have been given: A 50c increase in prescription charges; the delaying of a legitimate pension increase; and for pensioners who do not survive without the increase the abolition of pensioner funeral benefits; a reduction in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services through the imposition of staff ceilings; and a heavy reduction of overseas aid programs to deprived countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will come from the cancellation of various <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, the deferring of the pension increases, the introduction of subsidies to rich farmers, the tax allowances to increase company profits, the inconsistent behaviour in relation to the money supply and the haste to get out of public participation in development and exploitation of our mineral and energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In so doing, it introduced such a degree of capriciousness and incompetence into government policy making and administration as to destroy confidence throughout the entire community and to destroy the ability of the private sector- large and small business alike- to produce the real resources needed if Labor’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other programs were ever to be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great attributes of the Australian Labor Party Government was that it introduced into this nation a very effective early childhood <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it perfectly clear to honourable members in this House that the Government is committed to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children and is concerned with their problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was  Sir Winston  Churchill who once said, I think in 1938, that one of the great paradoxes of socialist governments is that from the day they assume office they tend to erode the foundations upon which private enterprise functions and thus destroy their own capacity to implement their ambitious social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs had plenty of merit, but in trying to implement them the former Government practically destroyed the whole foundations and the fabric of the Australian economy, which would have rendered impossible the discharge of even the most paltry assistance to areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) 1976- and by an accountant’s fiddle with the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We raise no objections to the transfer of the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund balances to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we propose to supplement Consolidated Revenue Fund receipts, and thereby reduce the size of the prospective Consolidated Revenue Fund deficiency, by paying into that Fund unrequired balances held in the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Trust Account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the transfer of funds from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in transferring funds from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund no opportunity is taken to give a false idea of what the deficit would actually be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the funds which go into the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund were originally revenue, they have been invested in treasury bills at some modicum of interest- one per cent or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have $3, 000m on the statement of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch);  we have $470m-odd from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund; and $700m will be available under the defence loan procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund was established by the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Act 1943 as a Trust Account for the purposes of section 62A of the Audit Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moneys standing to the credit of the Fund are applied under the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Act in making such payments as are directed by any law of the Commonwealth to be made from the Fund in relation to health, social services and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to begin by asking the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, how closing the <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund off in the way suggested by the Government can be said to be serving the legal purposes of the Fund which are supposed to relate to health, social services and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly, the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund was built up in years when we collected more in taxes than we were able to find purposes to spend, so in one sense there now is a logic in doing the oppositewhen we have more expenditure than revenue we simply transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe the greatest stimulus to consumer demand is more Government expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or the reduction of taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I make is in regard to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund which was mentioned by my friend the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia 30 per cent of taxes go to education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also want to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports with regard to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1952 an amendment to the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Act provided a standing appropriation for the automatic replenishment of the NWF from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of all moneys paid from the NWF. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the standing appropriation provisions for automatic replenishment of all amounts paid from the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund for social security, the balance of the Fund, of course, has been continually replenished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances there is no need for any working balance in the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund and in fact the balance serves no useful purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 16 of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act 1973 I present a Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report on the Australian Assistance Plan, together with a statement by the Minister for Social Security relating to that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the Australian Labor Government came to office it commissioned a report from the Australian Government Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the Governor-General’s Speech mention is made of the critical importance of voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those advertisements tersely state its objective and urge support for what it calls voluntaryism and private <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the Government, its spokesmen attack the middle income groups as the main recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, the bureaucrats and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Politicians, too, are identified by the Workers Party as persons having a vested interest in a burgeoning and inefficient <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued that new and elaborate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems buy popularity and votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may well be an electoral backlash against public servants, social workers and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which is not wholly unjustified, but it extends also to the more vulnerable people who depend on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to survive, and that is wholly unjustified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not inconceivable that cuts in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending could become extremely popular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To set these communities against one another and to set out cynically on an electoral strategy to destroy the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system because of short term political ends is an ignoble purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be arguments in this House about the effective delivery of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked of the different views on providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- whether it should be a universal or a selective basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With increased community wealth governments can spend more on pensions, schools, roads, health and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and on government administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the Government’s emphasis on directing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance to those in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that it is recognised that voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies are a critically important part of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite a hostile Senate and a media partial to the Liberal-Country Party coalition, the Labor Government after assuming office on 2 December 1972 had a magnificent record of achievement particularly in regard to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, child care, education, health, legal aid and direct monetary grants to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I will mention social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which has top priority because many age and invalid pensioners reside in my electorate of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that previous LiberalNational Country Party coalition governments saw fit to discriminate against various recipients of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also welcome those aspects of the Governor-General’s Speech relating to immigrants as being essential to any successful and humane immigration program and I also urge the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestions in the Henderson report directed at eradicating some of the deficiencies and prejudices which our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system presently contains regarding migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I live in and represent an electorate in which there is a great deal of poverty and personal hardship, particularly in the inner suburbs of Penh, I intend to devote much of my time in this House to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making what I hope will be constructive suggestions for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> management in this country, I must express my concern at the way in which honourable members opposite keep insisting that we are a businessman’s government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I see a mutual compatibility of interests between my support for a government which espouses the cause of free enterprise and my personal desire to become involved in both economic and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> management matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply suggest that existing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments be disbursed in a way which will not add to total expenditure but which, if done on a more selective basis, will ensure that more assistance will go to those whose needs are greatest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the future, when circumstances permit, it will be possible to restrain total expenditure and still preserve the rights and privileges of the disadvantaged people in Australia by ensuring that the whole spectrum of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments is applied more selectively and less universally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of universal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments in place of selective benefits is an inhumane strategy in a country in which resources are limited and in which poverty still very obviously exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In certain circumstances there is much to commend the universal provision of such <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits; it is in accord, in my opinion, with the best interests of a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the ability to pay is used as the basis of collecting revenue then the logical corollary is to support a criterion of need as the basis for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> disbursement from that revenue within our present social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, progressive taxation has a much greater redistribution effect than either regressive levies or proportionate contributions in the funding of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone deny that those increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits did other than increase the freedom of the recipients to live a normal life rather than the poverty stricken existence that was their lot under previous coalition governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will members of the Opposition never learn that they are here in this place not as an official Opposition to the Governor-General but as duly elected representatives of the people, to make some significant contribution to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and prosperity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is necessary to put the Australian Assistance Plan into some sort of perspective and to point out the extent of government outlays that are involved in social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as functional groupings in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is interesting to note that in 1972-73 the Government allocated $2, 102m to social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that in 1975-76 this amount had risen to an estimated $4,772m, which is an increase of over 100 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amount of course will be significantly higher because our allocations for social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are running at a rate of about 20 per cent of our total Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also interesting to note that the Budget Papers reveal that about $87m of the almost $5 billion allocated for social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is to go towards the cost of salaries and administration of the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth Government to the State Minister for Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, to the State committee for the implementation of the Plan, to the social planning secretariat thence to advisory committees and regional councils which in turn deal with local committees or projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first was the need for regional social planning and the regionalisation of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot of areas need to be looked at in terms of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This covers areas such as a uniform income benefit, inquiring into proposals for a minimum family income, looking at ways and means of wiping out the multitude of individual programs which now exist in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system and implementing a single program for which people could qualify in a multitude of different ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am suggesting tonight that the Government should look seriously at the recommendations in the report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission on the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Pursuant to section 34 of the Services Trust Fund Act 1947-1973 I present the annual reports of the Royal Australian Air Force <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Trust Fund, the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund for the calendar year 1 974, together with financial statements and the report of the Auditor-General on those statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to examine the awareness of specific learning difficulties among the community generally and among the medical, health, teaching and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> professions in particular; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have no pensions and no <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of any kind, perhaps just a small defence force and a police force as well, which is being just slightly socialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We may some day reach the stage in Australia- we are certainly not there yet- when we have all the schools, hospitals and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> institutions we want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like the honourable member and the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry to know that the Government is concerned for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps some well-meaning Fabians believe that we should spend the money on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They place on the Committee a responsibility to inquire into the incidence of specific learning difficulties throughout Australia, to examine measures that are being taken at the present time to overcome these difficulties- the Committee will be reporting on the success of present measures- and to examine the public awareness and knowledge of learning difficulties and the awareness in the medical, health, teaching and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that in areas which have no relationship to Aboriginal Affairs but which impinge upon the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginal people States have responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to pay tribute to the work of Manfred Cross, the former member for Brisbane, as I believe, as would all members who had the privilege of serving with him, he had a tremendous interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports that we brought down before the Parliament were not our only contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry was commenced in 1963 and was a longstanding commitment of members of Parliament to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people who were affected by mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It assumes that NEAT is some kind of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme in which the beneficiaries receives a little extra for doing some retraining instead of just waiting for a job to turn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was conceived not as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program but rather as a crucial part of an active manpower program in which the principal aim is to ensure that the labour market is well balanced; that is, that the numbers offering for employment in each occupation are as nearly as possible equal to the job opportunities available for each occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the scheme’s objective is to overcome structural imbalances in the labour force, it is far more appropriate to set the allowances on criteria that reflect the labour market nature of the program rather than on an irrelevant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, it observed that allowances payable in some of the then existing training schemes were based on the appropriate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit plus a supplementary training allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of what is now happening, it is extraordinarily interesting to note that the Committee decided nevertheless to reject the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> approach and did so on the advice of then Department of Labor, which Department recommended not only abandonment of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> approach but also that the allowance be based on the average adult male award wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $364.6m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-1974 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are maintaining this level of spending for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing despite our overall policy of stringent restraint on public sector spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some States are currently experiencing difficulties in maintaining their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs- difficulties, I might add, that are a direct legacy of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds available to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing increased from $ 169.8m in 1972-73 to $2 18.7m in 1973-74. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The funds made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing escalated even further in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Treasurer will be authorised to continue payments to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the period from 1 July 1976 until an appropriation measure for 1976-77 is passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that interim payments may be made for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing under the authority of section 5 of the Financial Agreement Act 1928 as advances supplementary to the advances under the approved Loan Council program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A far better method of increasing individual participation in the community would be via the Labor Government’s community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centre program- the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That program contained 2 necessary facets of community welfaregovernment guaranteed services and local decision-making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all the faults of the Whitlam Government, two vital threads ran, albeit imperfectly and inconsistently, through the fabric of its policy program: that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending Should be based on need and that the nation’s resources should be used as efficiently and beneficially as possible in the community’s interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard only in the last few days that as a result of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions these expectations can no longer be realised because it is believed there has been a block and that that block will mean, of course, that international trade will not be generated at the predicted figure of 7.5 per cent but will fall to an ever much lower figure with a consequent impact on commodity prices and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing this we will not only be able to produce more resources and provide more services to the community but also we will be able to provide for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners and those who might be regarded as being in the disadvantaged sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to thank the many folk who campaigned so resolutely to have the seat of Cook returned to the Liberal Party, not merely as part of the Fraser coalition team, but to support the principles, platform and policies of the Liberal Party of Australia which we have seen from the elections in December are clearly regarded by the vast majority of Australians as the only way to safeguard the future <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who among us hi this Parliament has not been exposed as a daily event to the work and interests of community groups concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the less fortunate or the less able? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is believed by the Government that voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations are a critically important part of the Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A broader look at social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities quickly reveals that the role of voluntary organisations was being downgraded very noticeably at the time of this Government’s return to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to see such a strong mention in the Governor-General’s Speech supporting the role and function of voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations in the community and the strong assertion to continue financial assistance in this area as well as ‘placing Public Service resources at their disposal through improving opportunities for transferability of staff between the Government and the non-government sector’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Government will view the Surf Life Saving Association not merely as an activity for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its members but as a self-helping voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation totally deserving of this Government’s support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House are concerned with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians and I remind honourable members opposite that it was a LiberalCountry Party Government which instituted the Inquiry into Poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been LiberalCountry Party governments which have moved into all new areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and concern and I am confident that in the years ahead it will still be the Liberal and National Country Parties, with their concern for the individual Australian and for his or her <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which will lead-and here is the great difference between our parties and the Opposition parties- in conjunction with community organisations to achieve the most effective <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and advantage for’ all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the most crying need in my.electorate in social terms and in terms of public debate concerns the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme, and I compliment some of the actions taken by the previous Labor Government in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the people of Australia should be constantly reminded that even after 3 years of Labor Government and the criticisms we have heard about child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and its implementation, we are still operating under a Liberal Government’s legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be an interesting exercise if honourable members went through all our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs to see to what extent we are operating under legislation instituted by the Liberal-Country Party Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately, however, the people could see the dangers of a socialist government and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is based on clear statements made by men engaged in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this Scheme, now administered by the Department of Social Security, a voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agency may, if it meets certain criteria, be given a direct grant for the employment of a social worker to work among immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So over the last 2 financial years, an average of $3 75m has been spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was one of the major achievements in the changing of resource allocation in our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was discussed within the Cabinet of the previous Government and it was thought that if it was necessary to make more funds available to the public sector in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing those funds would be made available if resources, men and material were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course we know that the last thing that the present Government would ever do would be to increase government expenditure, particularly in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the long term, if money continues to flow from the Australian Government to the State Governments, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing program will receive a much better deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my personal view that the sector that will suffer greatly under the present Administration will be not only the public sector but also the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector which is a most needy sector in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that a stimulus to the public sector, particularly in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, would provide a stimulus to the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are large backlogs of applications for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing is only a part of housing; housing is only a part of the building industry; and the building industry is only one section of the general Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to see <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, which is the subject matter of this Bill, in relation to the whole of the building industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can get interest rates down we will be helping the housing industry, not only in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector with which this Bill is concerned but also in the general sector with which the Government is, and should be, concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A big attack upon the interest rate structure is essential for a revival in non-<span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government’s current obsession with the mythical deficit will not preclude in the future a further advance to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing which will enable at least the current level of real activity- I do not speak of activity in terms of money- to be maintained and, I hope, even increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill we are debating today, the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill 1976, devotes attention to just one aspect of housing, namely what we call ‘<span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this was an important determining factor when the hard decisions were made by the Labor Government in the last Budget about the sums of money to be available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me lead on from this to say unequivocally that if Labor were in power and the same economic conditions prevailed as they do today, a third instalment of funds for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field would be in the pipeline right now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the valid point is this: If Labor were in power there would have been a third instalment of funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, but that instalment would have been less than is necessary under this Liberal-National Country Party Government right now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under Labor, the amount of the third instalment for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing would not have needed to be so great as it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is that there is no such prospect for a third instalment for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing from the Liberal and National Country parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that only about 5 per cent of the housing needs of  Australians  are satisfied through <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More and more of our people are turning to this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing sector as the access point to housing mortgage loan funds moves up the income scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing will never satisfy the existing demands, leave alone satisfy new demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point that I should like to make is that at the moment <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, in such short supply, is going to a lot of people who do not need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disturbed to note that Queensland is to receive only 8.5 per cent of the total amount of $364m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders why the Labor Government in framing its Budget saw fit to cut the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in respect of Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is very important because with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing we are looking in the main to the disadvantaged and low income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He overlooked the fact that to buy a house anywhere- even <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing- requires some accumulation of capital by the intending buyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides $364.6m for the various States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whole Bill is supposed to be about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members are going to talk about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, surely they will be talking about people who have limited resources and people who are least able to defend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indicative of our concern in this vital field of housing is that, notwithstanding our statesmanlike decision to curtail government expenditure, we have maintained the level of expenditure for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing at that which was appropriated in the 1975-76 Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential in debates such as this to analyse some of the history associated with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing agreements, so that we can learn from the mistakes that have been made and initiate reforms which will allow the system to function to the best advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there have been changes in details in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing agreements over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We witnessed many classical attempts to hoodwink the Australian people and nowhere was this more prominent than in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was pointing out the disadvantageous position of Queensland under the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing arrangments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland was ready to build more houses for needy people, as it indicated by seeking more money for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in March 1975, but the inept and lazy Labor Government did not give Queensland the money until June, after months of delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An analysis of the per capita advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing shows that the Australian average is $56.70 and the State averages are as follows: Tasmania, $119.50; South Australia, $91; Western Australia, $63.30; Victoria, $53.50; New South Wales, $51.40; and Queensland, only $37.50, notwithstanding the application by the Queensland Government in April 1975 following the challenge of the then Prime Minister in December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Production of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is virtually at a standstill and there will be very little in the pipeline after 30 June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Queensland Housing Commission, as my friend the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  said, has built up a good team of contractors who specialise in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An injection of Queensland’s rightful share of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> money would be quite appropriate to absorb a lot of this unused capacity and also make allowance for the expected shortfall in funds following the problems associated with building societies in Queensland recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who used the accommodation provided were people who on account of their incomes were not able to participate in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, but housing had to be provided as part of the general scheme of the development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had therefore a development of private industry which had special expertise in the construction area but which now has nowhere to go and nothing to do because of the drastic cutback in developmental exploration and the shortfall, in comparison to the Australian whole, of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing being allocated in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $364.6m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, in fact those who have contributed to the debate have ranged right across the spectrum of housing and those aspects applying to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission believes that problems of adjustment and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are, in general, best dealt with by specific measures rather than by input subsidies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me emphasise, in closing, that these Bills are not <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures, an idea which the Labor Party chooses to promote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think members of the Opposition have proved conclusively that they view them as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures by referring to them in relation to limited tonnages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those references indicate clearly that they regard them as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the minority report of the Industries Assistance Commission proves conclusively that in their opinion they are <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- and the Labor Party seems to use this area as its argument- I admit that we do not really have very much to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in terms of national benefit the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> argument probably would be better sorted out by the provision of other funds in other ways to the primary sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> factor does arise but it is not an important one from our point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our soil is looking for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; our farmers are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there is a case for measures of assistance to primary producers, particularly on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was supported on the limited ground that the bounty would help farmers adjust to higher superphosphate prices and would provide some temporary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All 3 commissioners agreed that the adjustment and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits of the bounty would be achieved by more direct measures at lower cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot see that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures which assist those least in need are irrational and self-defeating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many people in the farming sector in real need of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we do not say that these measures are <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures, they in part will put some confidence back on the one hand and on the other put some life back into the economy in a financial sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did members of the Opposition tell us how they would solve the problems of rural <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These not only have adverse effect on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of rural producers, on their employees and on the rural people and institutions dependent on agricultural industries but they have adverse resource allocation effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would make good economic sense, on both efficiency and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds, to distribute these incomes more evenly over time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By analogy, a hypothetical distribution of compensatory assistance over time, to make it countercyclical, would consequently improve economic efficiency in the rural sector and would remove one area of potential conflict between economic efficiency and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in any proper debate on this subject we always have to remember that there is a relationship between the manufacturing sector, the primary industry sector and, as I have said, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area of those in need in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to an examination by the Government in the period that this bounty is in force until 30 June 1977 so that we can have a good look at what is happening in rural Australia, so that hopefully we can develop <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies to assist those in need in those areas and so that we can develop reconstruction policies in certain sections of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is really no good rational economic, social or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> argument why we should subsidise the users of superphosphate any more than we should subsidise orchardists who use expensive chemicals or poultry farmers who have to purchase very expensive feed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>difficult to justify on the basis of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that some form of income support scheme would be preferable, both on economic and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds, to a subsidy on one input such as superphosphate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s history is characterised not by examples of people seeking more and more dependence on government but by people with the courage, the ambition and the common sense to improve their lot, and in so doing play their role in contributing to the national resource- the fund from which general standards in health, education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other avenues can be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time we give massive increases in pensions and benefits under Medibank and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programswhich it is our bounden duty to do- we are in fact depriving ourselves of the capacity to help underdeveloped nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can cover civil rights, environment, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, consumer protection, anti-trust, security law and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government policies which influence mortality are posited primarily on the desire to enhance the health, safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community and their effect on population growth is incidental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies both to policies involving government services to the Australian people, such as education or social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and to policies in which population is treated as a resource, such as the gearing of manpower to economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fellow who lives in rented accommodation and who for environmental reasons- say, for the sake of argument, the presence of a noxious industry or an airport, which is affecting his family-and who can obtain alternative rental accommodation only in an area where, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Employment Service, there are little or no employment prospects is rewarded for caring for his family’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by having his umployment benefit terminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like the House to compare that record with the Labor Government’s record in 3 years of government, 3 years in which the most significant achievements were made in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the honourable member for Oxley would have been better engaged if he had made some constructive criticisms of the legislation and of the future of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies because that is what we are dealing with and that is why we are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are here to try to assist the Government or to criticise the Government about improvements in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy and not to live in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will concede, as the honourable member for Oxley seemed to have some pleasure in pointing out, that the Labor Party did do some good things in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> when it was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to read into the record just 4 points in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy which was unanimously adopted by the Liberal and Country parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third part of our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy is this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To some extent those grants are now provided by State government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we have put into our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy that we will remove from voluntary organisations the burden of providing emergency cash assistance, without infringing their ability to provide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if one dismisses the humanitarian grounds on which I am speaking, surely on a hard, economic, cost benefit analysis the Government’s case is unanswerable because that woman would have then gone off social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and would have been earning wages and paying taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that in a Liberal-National Country Party Government, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> does not always enjoy the highest priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another misconception is that a Labor government is the only government which can possess an enlightened social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had referred to the magnanimity of the previous Government in matters of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and I was asking how magnanimous was it when it created the highest level of unemployment since the Depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, how enlightened was the Labor Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy when that Government’s permissiveness caused the highest level of inflation in this country’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the enlightened <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy in a government which imposes that rate of inflation on pensioners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure was expressed in 1973-74 money terms and did not include all Labor’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to admit that in the past both Liberal and Labor Governments have not treated <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients as well as they might have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is a desirable economic and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the nature of the pension itself should be considered periodically and outside the constraints of contemporary or conventional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to support both Bills and the thrust of the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thrust of the policy is, firstly, to concentrate resources on areas of need and secondly, to preserve the real value of pensions and other major <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How the House must miss the former honourable member for Perth,  Mr Joe  Berinson, who was steeped in a genuine understanding of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social security matters and who worked assiduously to formulate Labor’s policy in these areas which the honourable member for Perth had the temerity to disparage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great initiatives were taken in rehabilitation training allowance, supplementary rent pension, abolition of the means test, assistance to the handicapped, home care for the elderly, support for senior citizen centres and subsidies for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers who service them, Meals on Wheels, assistance for homeless men and matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that happens- this is a criticism of State governmentsis that every time there is an increase in the pension, the tenants of Housing Commission houses or flats, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, in Victoria at any rate, always have their rentals raised and this generally absorbs most of the increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commitment was contained in the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development aware that under the direction of the former Federal Labor Government 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> houses built by the States and funded by the Commonwealth were available on only a rental basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker Graeme Brewer of the Brotherhood of St Laurence has found that the ratio of jobless people to job vacancies stands at 1 1 to one, and for young people it is even higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak with some sorrow and some unabated anger on this occasion: Sorrow at the decision, but determined to accept it, and unabated anger at the cant and hypocrisy that we have seen from honourable members opposite who, once again, turn the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the pensioners of Australia, which I regard as a most serious matter, into yet another debate which has been prostituted by their treating the pensioners of this country as a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pensioners or people needing assistance were getting $ 1 out of every $4 spent on the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an issue that in my own electorate has caused those constituents who are pensioners to be concerned about our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives and our direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I too have felt that the withdrawal of this benefit may cast doubts on our overall aims in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy, but I know that the Government faces severe economic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I support the decision now I have this to say: I urge the Government in its next review of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits to look very closely at the gap that has been left by the withdrawal of this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to say that I believe it is only the first bite at achieving our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the States, with their access to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, police forces and so on, are in a better position to take a spot judgment than is the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speakers on both sides of the Houses have made observations and suggestions on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters which I have noted, and I will make sure that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in the other place is made aware of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accused us of dismantling and distorting the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, of breaking promises and of dealing coldly and harshly with pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previously the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was also represented; but, in view of the abolition of the Commission in the near future, it will not have continuity of representation in that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  these 2 Bills represent the first step of the Government in achieving its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and repatriation policy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13 September 1974- in the heyday of the former Administration- the then Minister for Housing and Construction, who interjected a moment or two ago, said that so far as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was concerned he would provide a bottomless pit of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in the Hayden Budget of last August <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds were cut back by $20.8m which, having regard to the rate of inflation, certainly was a very much larger figure then than it is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This area has now been covered by the present Government, which is determined to look after the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> not only of the building industry but of the young home builders and the industrial builders of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to say that I believe it is only the first bite at achieving our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member said that this was the first step towards the Government achieving its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that this was the first step toward achieving the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the honourable member’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives are exactly the same as those of the honourable member for Denison and those of all other honourable members on the Government side now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what an admission on the part of the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Franklin- this step was only the first bite at achieving the Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What benefit received by pensioners is this Government going to abolish next as the second bite of its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We appointed the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commission and did other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For interest sake I add that the Regular Defence Forces <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association has communicated with my constituent saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are of the mistaken view that their own <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would be best served under a 95 per cent content plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is really no primary responsibility on the Commonwealth, apart from and distinct from that which is the responsibility of local government, State government, State government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies and the like, to do anything differently in respect of Aboriginals than it would do in respect of other members of the community who, by their anti-social misbehaviour, bring themselves into ill repute with their neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are programs within the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies of government and there are activities which local government can undertake to help Aboriginals who are housed under this national housing program embarked upon by this Government as it has been embarked upon by previous governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Treasurer by saying that he would be aware that in the last year of the McMahon Government $167m was made available to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and that over the last 2 years of the Whitlam Government the average amount for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was $375m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned the figure of $375m and I assume he was referring to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Joint planning, and even conduct, of schools by educational, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, cultural and sporting agencies could provide additional facilities for the school, allow the community access to its resources, and thus generally increase its fruitfulness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard from a former Minister for Education, the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley),  one who has had a long-standing, and in many respects a passionate interest in the educational <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All tentative planning activities in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field will be affected seriously by any definitive, comprehensive and authoritative statements concerning population projections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly many eminent demographers would contend that the population size and the ultimate population size is only going to be of relative consideration- relative to the standards of living we want, relative to productivity, relative to what governments do to ensure the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their citizens and relative to economic strategy in relation to unemployment and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor initiatives in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field at one stage made Australia attractive to immigrants but the Government has now, I believe- I think we can be critical of this-attempted to dismantle the Labor initiatives in that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that payments to people on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in those countries are far in excess of what we can offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Family unity, growth centres, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other requirements, representations on bodies that affect the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their own future and representations throughout the occupational structures that give a voice to the individuals are some of the matters to which I make reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then with the increase in these interest rates we saw a growing demand for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir, it  would not be inappropriate to conclude on this note: You, as the honourable member for Herbert, my honourable friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean),  the honourable and gallant member for Isaacs  (Mr Hamer), Senator Devitt  and  Senator Maunsell-  3 honourable members from this place and 2 senators from the other placehave continued to show a very lively and a very compassionate interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of exservicemen and in particular in securing the appropriate adjustments to the pension entitlements of ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister will be looking at a number of the practical effects of the legislation concerning the regulatory bodies that he has responsibility for in his portfolio and ensure that in the coming review of the trade practices legislation and any other reviews he might be conducting of other regulatory bodies, he will seek to ensure that they are acting consistently and in the best interests of efficiency and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until that happens, there can be no confidence in the industry, there can be no advance in the employment opportunities and there can be no reversal of the present trend towards the dismantling of one of the industries which is basic to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though my financial interest in the industry and in the company is not very great, I will admit, I do feel a great degree of commitment to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfortunate, however, that some of the matters raised by you don’t seem to have been properly answered by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission’s ‘Green Paper’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Western Adelaide Regional Council for Social Development has at its disposal $456,000 to be given to the community in grants to support community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1.3 The AAP should be seen as complementing other planning mechanisms which may be established between the Commonwealth Government and State Governments within the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1.8 The AAP provides some financial resources to be allocated by the Regional Councils for Social Development by way of grants for community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this is not the major source of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other specific Commonwealth Government programs such as Community Health, Child Care, Community Arts, Tourism and Recreation, and the Aged and Handicapped Persons programs, for example, are the main source of funds for particular aspects of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Western Adelaide Regional Council of Social Development is fortunate to have amongst its members such notable people as 3 local Mayors, a number of Aldermen, several medical practitioners, a Regional Director of the Department of Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, a member of Parliament, Chairman of Community Councils for Social Development, a Superintendent of Police, a Baptist Minister and other activists in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I quote further from the same statement: ‘The Liberal and National Country Parties reiterate their commitment to supporting and enlarging participation in the decision-making structures relating to the AAP and reaffirm their commitment to the on-going nature of the Plan as a means of assisting individuals, groups and areas in greatest need of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance at the community level . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘We are in favour of increased funds for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects and agree that the AAP is, basically, a suitable vehicle through which social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds may be channelled to the community . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I on this occasion also quote from the official Liberal and National Country Parties Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Document: ‘We welcomed the introduction of the Australian Assistance Plan, because we believed that provision of some Commonwealth funds and assistance would act as a catalyst for citizen involvement in positive community service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me stress once more that due to the representation of all three levels of government and non-government voluntary community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies the Western Adelaide Regional Council for Social Development serves very well the role of a co-operating and liaising body which does not impose its views on the community but is representative of community opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly, it cuts across what now is becoming increasingly clear- the aspirations and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the East Timorese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, a scheme like the current one which is production orientated gives the larger grower a larger proportion of the funds available and the smaller grower receives only a small amount of the funds available which, in many cases, just becomes a form of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance rather than viable support to take growers over the hump of any particular crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Commonwealth social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits are not available to growers because of the work test, the stabilisation payments in many cases are just a substitute for this kind of benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure, the scheme has not been at all satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in another form, is it not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frequently their only regret is that they did not make the decision much sooner and that they delayed the decision for far too long, to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also pockets of depression within our rural industries and, I suppose, not only within our apple industries, where one must suggest that some sort of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He criticised the form of support in this legislation, which is on what I call the productive unit basis, as not being as advantageous as what he called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this form of assistance is not the most beneficial and somehow or other the claims of the Australian Labor Party that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance is better are true, could members of the Opposition suggest what they would do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time they were in office they did not introduce any successful <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure for agriculture, including a most important one, that is, the provision of unemployment benefits for self-employed people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To our discredit we also have not introduced any measure to overcome this most unjust provision in our social security legislation that self-employed people are automatically deprived by regulation of any form of assistance through the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system and, in particular, unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By and large, it was my clear impression from comments of people in the voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area who were committed to the provision of accommodation for the aged, that they believed that we had been a particularly generous government in the provision of assistance in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that a former Minister for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> has returned to the chamber in the backbenches of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect I wish to raise is the overall achievement in the field of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we created a soft society by taking so many initiatives in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and providing more generous benefits in the field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiative which gets votes but it is the sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives which satisfies one greatly because one realises that one has discharged a very important moral obligation in society to do something for the very serious social casualties that we do have in our community, and to help the very worthwhile people who dedicate their lives to helping the men and women who are homeless and who are drifting in the community, often in a situation of that nature because of some sort of crisis that has occurred in their life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 197 1-72 when we came into office the percentage of gross domestic product spent on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was 4.4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very harsh, a very brutal and very insensitive society that does not accept the point of view that there are people in this community who, in spite of all we did, are still not being reached by the programs of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which are available, and that more needs to be done, not the least of which is the introduction of some sort of guaranteed income concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  who just spoke, referred to the great achievement of the Labor Government in increasing the percentage of gross domestic product spent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also referred to what he believed was one thing that the Labor Government had done; it had not made Australia a soft society in spite of this increase in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, if one looks at the increase in the percentage of GDP spent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> one sees that a significant percentage of that increase was spent on unemployment benefits which was made necessary by the massive increase in unemployment through the maladministration of that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one can agree with the honourable member but still look for the real cause of soft societies which spend a great percentage on unemployment benefits and on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases government expenditure has not achieved the same degree of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance that could be achieved by a closer look at people going into the homes and by the proper priority of capital expenditure in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it represents an isolated element of benevolence on the part of the Government in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- a government which in other respects is mounting an assault on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand at the cross-roads in many respects in the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the by-products of the Labor Party’s unfortunate difficulties was that much <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was cut back and that in turn helped to cut back some of the building industry activity itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowadays we need to ensure that we spend our money on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters in the best way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a massive problem facing it in getting the economy going and directing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> package is being developed by this Government to ensure that compassion is maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept the proposition that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies in the Australian community or the aged people who are dependent upon this program are representative of the soft society, that this measure is necessary so that people will be saved from the moral degradation which flows from being victims of the soft society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies which very grandly and proudly maintain these sorts of services, will find that financial assistance which we would have provided- we would have guaranteed that the program would have been finished in less than 3 years- in fact may not come within 5 or 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that the first <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiative by the Government was to reintroduce the superphosphate bounty for wealthy graziers like the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was Minister for Social Security I used to sit on the front bench at question time and wonder why I received so few questions from the then Opposition- the LiberalNational Country Parties- on such a range of important <span class="highlight">welfare</span> issues for which I was responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> issues that have been debated in the Parliament, I have noted that he has derived great hilarity from the concern expressed by the members of the Opposition about people affected by the discrimination and the unfairness of the burden which has been imposed on these sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the report fully justifies the stand taken by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Senator Cavanagh,  who, against great odds and despite the reluctance of the Western Australian Premier, despite the reluctance of the Minister for Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in the Western Australian Government and despite the opposition of the Police Commissioner and the  Deputy  Police Commissioner, persisted with the idea of probing this unfortunate incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, since there has been large scale evidence of bad treatment of Aboriginal people by the courts, the police, institutional people and many others associated with justice, I sought at the request of the Aboriginal Legal Service and a large number of other legal people and persons involved with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations to extend the terms of that inquiry past the Northern Territory on to a Australia wide basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must provide country residents, wherever possible, with basic services (education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health, culture and recreation). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission- for an outstanding document and I extend my appreciation to the Minister for embracing it and its philosophies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commitment to continue the AAP was in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy of the Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly concerned that Australia may be in for a period of open ended <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demands on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> vote are showing signs of increasing by very large amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount allocated for the function of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in 1965-66 was $933m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the amount of Commonwealth Government outlays for the social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> function was about 18 per cent of the total outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present financial year, under the last Labor administration, the amount allocated to the social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> function is close to $5,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figure for the social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> function is approaching 25 per cent of total expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in 10 years the outlays on the social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> function have risen from 18 per cent to an amount roughly equivalent to 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> spending increased steadily in the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trend, rather than getting better, is expected to get worse, barring a sudden and drastic overhaul of the whole <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia needs to look at <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and at the emotional and extreme demands on Federal Government outlays in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must determine a level of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending which is acceptable to the community and to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we must allocate that amount of money among all our competing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> functions, in much the same way that there is an acceptable figure for the amount of money that ought to be spent on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am horrified at the prospect of the politically sensitive area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> putting increasing pressure upon the Parliament and upon the Government m relation to the expenditure outlays which the Parliament is called upon to allocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must accept the fact that we cannot allow to develop in Australia a situation which would be anywhere near similar to the American experience where something in excess of 50 per cent of the federal Government’s outlays are going one way or another into the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often it is increased by political activity, by bidding up and by the creeping <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not use that word disparagingly, but the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commitment tends to creep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is particularly important that we take note of it in this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the factors which has affected the American experience has been the collapse of the capacity of the city to carry its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, which was the historical means by which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was financed in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia a not dissimilar situation has occurred in recent years with regard to State <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs being substantially taken over by Federal funding, in some instances- I would think significant instances- without a greater expenditure of actual funds on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you were to say to these people who find a burden the amount that they are now paying in rates out of their weekly wage that they should in turn provide themselves with their own social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs it would seem very incongruous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is very important for the whole <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia that these industries be kept on a sound basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, there are the ordinary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, which took up about $6,000m in the last Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are the socially oriented enterprises, such as health, education and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a curious idea particularly when even the Opposition must by now recognise that it was a failure of the private sector in Australia to earn profits- this was under the Labor Government’s profit bashing activitieswhich brought about a diminution in the pool of resources from which we were trying to pay for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, from which we were trying to meet all the demands of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not replenish that pool, if you do not provide the money or the national wealth from which to meet the demands of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, if you keep paying with non-existent Hayden cheques on a nonexistent bank account, then you simply destroy out society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the extent to which any government’s capacity to make <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to the needy in the society is being diminished by the massive cost of making those payments, the huge rises in administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An increasing amount of its moneymoney that should be going in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments -is now going in administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were massive increases and, I would submit, to a large degree inefficient increases in the actual methods by which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was handed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are seeing money that we would have hoped might have been available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ending up in the hands of the postal authorities which are now, of course, in a separate organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It strikes me that this is a most unfortunate feature of what inflation does to our capacity to pay <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to the community of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, $100m of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> vote is to go into the area of administration and salaries instead of to pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that a large proportion of this amount would have to go to the administrators anyway no matter how well organised the payment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do say is that many of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits that over the years have made up a large part of the spectrum of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia are inefficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, particularly small once off payments for special historically sound but now economically unreasonable benefits, simply cost too much to administer because of the massive rise in wages that has taken place, particularly over the last 3 years of uncontrolled and irresponsible inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It strikes me that when we are looking at ways of saving money, or conversely of increasing the proportion of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> vote that actually goes to pensioners or to others in receipt of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, surely we should be examining how to make certain that these inefficient benefits can be replaced by efficient ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I am suggesting that there are many opportunities for looking at the efficiency of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, many of which could well be removed because they involve single one off payments or are expensive to issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, although not taking anything away from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> we should make certain that the bulk of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> money goes to the people who should be receiving it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot afford, and the pensioners of this nation cannot afford, to see such ever increasing proportions of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar going in salaries and administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When talking about the pool from which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> money is distributed- that is, the pool of accumulated profits of the society and wages earned in the society as a result of active profitability and an active private sector- the PA Consulting Services Pty Limited report on business profitability showed that almost three out of every four industry groups in Australia suffered a lower return on shareholders funds after tax and interest in the latest year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has attacked our capacity to have the resources to pay <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us now look at ways by which we can improve our payment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, within the constraints that have been set upon us by the chaotic and inefficient economic policy of the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as the major point of the honourable gentleman’s question is concerned, that is to say the family allowances and the major increase in child endowment, if I may say so,  Mr Speaker,  that is one of the most significant measures of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> introduced in this country by any government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is determined to put some limit on the blank cheque that has been signed in relation to Medibank because it knows perfectly that if the expenditure on Medibank is allowed to grow at its present rate it will grow so fast that the money needed for it can come only from future education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is also providing an increase- a large increase- in child endowment, which will be paid to the mothers of children in areas in which there is real need and in which the private <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies have said that such payment is so necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that there is a prospect- a little prospect perhaps, but growing into a bigger one as the days go by- that those wise men in the trade union movement will help the Government to succeed in achieving goals that will improve the national development of this country and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of most Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The package presented to the wage earnerthe plus items of wage indexation and increased endowment, combined with the minus of the Medibank levy and the loss of deductibility for children- was presented as a ‘sensible policy’ that would add to his, the wage earner’s, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party said during that period that what it would do was introduce pensions that were indexedour motivation was social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- so that they always kept their value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the average Australian is concerned about national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the overall interests of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are one of the governments in the world which have acted to reduce their spending, to cut the size of the Public Service and to cut down on the open ended claims which people can make on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowances plan obviously, therefore, has a dual benefit for the country: Firstly, it introduces a very real measure of social justice into our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system and, secondly, together with the impact of” personal income tax indexation, it will redirect resources to people in the community who have a much higher propensity to consume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, I believe, and my Party believes, very strongly in the principle of a right to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits according to need and not according to any pompous and selfrighteous moral judgment as to the cause of a person’s deprivation or disadvantaged position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new scheme of family allowances which benefits those worst off families the most is a major advance in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia and is recognised as such by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was never put more bluntly than it was in last Sunday’s Adelaide  Sunday Mail  in an article, under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Minister ‘ ‘ shocked ‘ ‘, ‘ which said: ‘Shocked and bitterly disappointed’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the new system is a real advance in our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, bearing in mind that it provides that the taxpayer no longer has the right to claim tax deductions for his dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new family allowances are probably the most far-reaching <span class="highlight">welfare</span> step taken by any government since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to all Australians, particularly to social workers and to people in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, that we really care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say that we are more concerned about real <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than any other Parry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We therefore welcome the substantial moves in recent years by several States into the provision of more comprehensive family and community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>much of the administration of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be carried out by local communities under the leadership of local governments, but the responsibility for ensuring that no one in any locality is neglected is a State responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Baume,  the  chairman  of the Government supporters <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee, or whatever it is called, gave an assurance that none of the Government senators would cross the floor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is designed basically to restore the pool of wealth from which this nation can pay its <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, from which it can pay for all the things that it should be doing in the total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple proposition is that if we do not have an economy that is in fact stimulated, an economy that is working hard, an economy that is producing revenue and gross domestic product, we do not have the surpluses available to put back into <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not simply a question of saying ‘too much of the cake is going to the business sector, let us put some into <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it the problem we now face is how to make certain that we replenish the pool with funds so that we can in fact go ahead with many of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives that I believe were quite properly supported by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My complaint with those <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives is that the Labor Government endeavoured to pay for them with non-existent money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My complaint is that the Labor Government destroyed our capacity to pay for those <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having built up the expectations of the people of Australia those initiatives must now be deferred until we can restore the wealth of society- the wealth of this nation- sufficiently to be able to pay for those <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will lead us to a far better economy and a far better nation- a nation that can afford more and more <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that is real rather than illusory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In studies sponsored by the United States Department of Health Education and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, comparisons between Federal employees who are covered by Blue Cross (where doctors receive a fee for service) and those enrolled in a prepaid group health plan (where the physicians are paid the same amount whether they operate or not) showed that - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This coutry has been witness to, some of the most severe and, in many cases, quite unjustified expenditure cuts on very worthwhile community programs, in such areas as health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and urban improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of its first and highest priorities when it came into government in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field was to reintroduce the $30m superphosphate bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, a whole range of important community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs-health services, health benefits- were cut back and made more expensive because they were given a lower priority in the eyes of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was pointed out to the Minister (a) that nobody would regard it as compensation for the owner of a property if that owner were European to inform him that his property was being disposed of for the benefit of all the people of Queensland and he would have his share in that, and (b) that it would be perfectly easy to use the royalties in a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fund as a means of reducing the payment of other consolidated revenue into the fund, to no ultimate real benefit to Aborigines, the Minister made a priceless reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making choices we have been concerned to protect areas such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments where people are affected as individuals or areas especially important to opportunity, such as education where real growth in expenditure will be encompassed especially in areas related to the trades which have been so much neglected even under the previous Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably the most devastating effect of the mini-Budget proposals in that rentals on government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing will be increased to the level of rental charges in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Incidentally, these are all groups which the previous Labor Government of compassion and concern, to use its own well-known phraseology, ignored and oppressed even further because of inflation of its own making and because of its construction of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bureaucracy which ensured that the minimum of money, in fact, reached those most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let those honourable members and others in the community who are concerned for the Aborigines in Australia take note of this: Of every dollar spent on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> only 13c ever reached the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have pruned Government spending by a projected $2 billion without disturbing essential <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs, as we promised in the campaign of last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 3 years Australia laboured under a Labor Government there was an unprecedented transfer of resources- from profits to wages and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; from the private to the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the Henderson reports on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> stated: . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the process, it is becoming a lucrative business- for professional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, administrators, researchers and consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very young and the very old had become a greater charge on the taxpayers along with the army of professional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, administrators, researchers and consultants, child minding centres and staffs and nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs such as the Australian Assistance Plan must be pruned to realistic levels before the Australian people lose their initiative and independence altogether and settle for a way of life based on handouts, as they were encouraged to do by our predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments as are required to help the genuinely needy should be made in some way that will ensure that they get directly to those who need them, without passing through a chain of bureaucratic middlemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the Government do the same with all other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In practice the power and responsibilities of that guardianship have been delegated to the Director-General, the Department of Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in South Australia, and to the principal officers of the relevant child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities in other States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hence the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and status of these children will continue to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in association with child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities, is concerned to do whatever is possible within her powers to facilitate the adoption of the many children such as these and in fact already has signed some 90 orders which have the effect, by exempting the children from the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, and hence the guardianship of the Minister, of permitting the due legal processes in the States or Territories to determine whether adoption applications may be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exhaustive enquiries are made by the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities and considerable delays can occur before the Courts or, in the case of Queensland, the Director of Children’s Services, who is the approving authority in that State, can consider these applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delays can occur because of the sheer volume of work imposed on social workers and other staff in the offices of the State and Territory child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities, or in getting the matter before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any enquiries about these matters should be directed to the relevant State of Territory child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The addresses of the principal officers of the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities in each State and Territory appear at the end of this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the above reasons, people interested in sponsoring a child from overseas for the purpose of adoption or who are proposing to adopt a child overseas, should in the first instance, seek advice from the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities in their State or Territory of residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that people contemplating adopting a child overseas should seek the advice of the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authority of the State or Territory in which they reside before initiating any adoption action overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, those people who have adopted a child overseas should similarly consult the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities in the State or Territory where they reside, as otherwise problems for that child may occur in the future if the adoption is not recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1952, by agreement with the State and Territory authorities, those powers and functions of guardianship of the Federal Minister for Social Security under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, have been delegated to the principal officers of the relevant State and Territory child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities excepting the power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of adoption, the preparation of a recommendation by a State or Territory Child <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> authority involves a careful examination of the situation which can be a lengthy process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will enable child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities to take all the necessary action in connection with adoption, marriage or departure from Australia without the necessity of referring the matter to the Federal Minister for Social Security unless there are exceptional circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To ensure that the children’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is safeguarded, the Minister for Social Security has requested that child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities continue to refer for attention, matters of an unusual nature or where malpractices occur, and has asked to be kept informed on a regular basis of the number of children in their State or Territory who are known to come within the provisions of that Act or are exempted therefrom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(a) At the Conference of the Council of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ministers in Darwin on 21 May 1976 I outlined the Commonwealth Government’s decision on the Australian Assistance Plan as follows: ‘In the light of our consideration of all that has been done to evaluate the Plan, we believe that it is a worthwhile experiment in social planning and local action in determining <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government does not propose to make funds available for new community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects but commitments on projects already approved, but not totally funded, will be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond this, the Commonwealth does not propose further funding for the Australian Assistance Plan either for community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects or for administration or development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has any ( a ) financial or ( b ) other assistance under the Australian Assistance Plan been received by (i) Australian Red Cross Society, (ii) Catholic Family <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Bureau (Victoria), (iii) Salvation Army, (iv) The Childrens Protection Society (Victoria ) and (v) International Social Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-84">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Commonwealth Government extended to these descendants of the Kanakas the same <span class="highlight">welfare</span> rights given to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the areas of health, education, housing and legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-88">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If revenue constraints are to be respected- as they will be by a responsible Government- gainers and losers will emerge whenever substantial changes are made to major <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs: it is not practicable for the law to take account of each and every variant in personal or domestic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-98">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A further relevant point is that it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from such comparisons as to the ‘efficiency’ or ‘<span class="highlight">welfare</span> ‘ of particular sectors of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who has supported this addition strongly, and one who has supported an 87.75 per cent increase in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funding in the Australian Capital Territory, I felt obliged to rise tonight to answer this partisan and propagandist statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was established as an interim committee by the Labor Government in early 1 973, and the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act received the royal assent in November of that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reaching its decision about the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission the present Government was mindful of the fact that in June 1975 the then Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had announced the Labor Government’s intention to abolish the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear to the Government that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission is not required in a situation in which the Government, through its Ministers, will be determining priorities and maintaining direct communications on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> issues with State, local government and voluntary agencies and representatives of consumer groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there are many voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations which are playing an important role in commenting on the formulation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say a little more about our plans for improved consultation with the voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector in a few moments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS), the Australian Council on the Ageing (ACOTA) and the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled (ACROD) Will receive- in 1976-77 grants totalling $0.45 m. In addition to the funding of these national bodies the Government supports a variety of other organisations in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission did not directly administer any Commonwealth <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government fully recognises the importance of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the life of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly,’ in order to ensure that adequate data is available for policy and planning purposes and that the best use is made of available resources, it is proposed to establish a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> research centre within the University of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, the Government is taking steps to fulfil its commitment to provide effective mechanisms for co-operation and interchange of ideas with interested groups in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A national consultative group on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is to be established to meet with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and her officers to discuss and advise on current issues in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I envisage that the consultative group will have a membership of about 12 people comprising academics from relevant disciplines and other suitably qualified people active in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, together with possibly one or two distinguished people with appropriate experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will include representatives of national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bodies and voluntary social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies, and will be serviced by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs and problems of people are, in the main, similar throughout Australia but there are differences between States and, indeed, within the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is accordingly proposed to establish a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> consultative committee in each State and Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These committees will provide an input, in relation to the situation of people in each State, on problems or difficulties encountered in the administration of Commonwealth social security or social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs at the State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will ensure that the very valuable contribution which these groups can make in relation to the special needs of women is available to the Government in formulating its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further details of the consultative mechanisms proposed will be announced shortly but at this stage I can assure honourable members that our proposals will greatly strengthen our links with people and groups active in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the continuing involvement of the Department of Social Security in income security issues, routine monitoring and evaluation of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs are being developed and upgraded within the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Division of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will continue to support independent inquiries which examine various aspects of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These inquiries, of which the Poverty Inquiry and the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry are examples, are particularly important in contributing to the development of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in 1972 the Liberal-Country Party Government commissioned, with the support of the State Ministers responsible for child and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, a family research project within the University of New South Wales to undertake a series of studies directed towards understanding and documenting family disruption and breakdown and changing family patterns in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has given undertakings that an examination would be made of activities of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission to ascertain the extent to which existing research projects and tasks would be continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also agreed to the funding of 2 additional research projects and 4 fellowships in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two major areas into which a number of these projects have a substantial input are the development of services relating to families and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> manpower planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These studies are complementary to the work of the commission’s Family Services Committee on which is represented relevant departments at Federal and State levels, and the voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> manpower planning, present statistics concerning the workforce in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field are not satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meeting of State Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Ministers held in Darwin on 2 1 May 1976 identified social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> manpower planning as of vital importance and the Minister for Social Security has agreed to the Minister’s request that the work initiated by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission in this area be continued, with more direct involvement of the States as they are major users of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> manpower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investigation will continue on the need for a national body to co-ordinate education in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Darwin conference of Ministers there was also strong support for standardisation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was noted that there was great difficulty in arriving at priorities in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or making any meaningful comparisons of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs without having an adequate data base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security agreed that her department should undertake work immediately in this area seeking the co-operation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in setting up a working party, comprising representatives of relevant Commonwealth and State government departments, to examine questions of the standardisation and adequacy of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> statistics and the desirability of convening a national conference on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The staff of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission now occupy Public Service Act positions which are included on the establishment of the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Action will be taken to transfer commission staff to the unattached list of the department on repeal of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some officers will be used in activities, such as administering research projects and fellowship awards, servicing the Family Services Committee and undertaking work in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> manpower planning, responsibility for which will be absorbed by the department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is mindful of the work which the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission has undertaken but, for the reasons I have outlined, it is now considered opportune to consolidate advice on and research into social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters within the appropriate departmental structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Labor Treasurer said in his Budget Speech- this is something that might appeal to honourable gentlemen opposite- that to introduce tax indexation without cutting education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commitments would be ‘to ask the impossible’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made real increases in education funds and even greater increases in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds; yet we still managed to increase full tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We allocated $5,389m for our continuing commitment to maintain and improve social security benefits and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope it will provide the Government with a new mechanism to make <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing sensitive to the needs of the users rather than those of the planners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be closely monitoring the progress of this important <span class="highlight">welfare</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the whole history of moneys paid by the Australian Government to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1973-74 the Commonwealth, under a new Agreement applying for the 5 years from 1973-74 to 1977-78- this was commenced under a Labor Governmenthas advanced funds to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing outside, and in addition to, Loan Council arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing has been a political football for many years for honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>55m to provide rent rebates and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for deserving people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year of the McMahon Government an amount of $ 167m was made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing under the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, $375m will have been spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing this financial year and in each of the last 2 financial years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference is that the former Conservative Government charged interest rates of 7 per cent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing whereas when Labor came to power that interest rate was reduced to 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the money was made available to improve the situation of public or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing which was an extremely short commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time something like 100 000 people were on the waiting lists for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government stands condemned because it has reduced expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and urban and regional development, particularly in Sydney and in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Economist  records, f stg500m has been cut off the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brought about a marked decrease in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not made cuts in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Money incomes rise to preserve purchasing power and the Government can adjust social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to protect lower income earners, pensioners and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the family allowance scheme, about which the honourable member spoke at length, I am sure that they will realise that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people is uppermost in the minds of all Government supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a wife and mother is deserted and left without maintenance the community, through <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, makes provision to take over the breadwinner’s role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were 5 men who had a lifelong interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of exservicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) 1976 is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $375m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1976-77 advances are high in real terms compared with earlier years when the States themselves allocated <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds from their overall loan council works-housing program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the Agreement was negotiated the States were intended to receive an interest concession of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent on their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds because the long-term bond rate was then 6.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This in itself was significantly more generous than any previous financial arrangements for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has borne the entire increased cost of the loan funds from which the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advances are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of interest rate concessions on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds to States is currently about 6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of real assistance for the States’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs has therefore increased considerably as the interest concession has become greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the only sensible course, particularly within the present objectives of budgetary policy generally, is to seek to restore activity in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing area to an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing sector is a small but important part of the total housing sector; in recent years government dwelling construction has amounted to something like 12 per cent of total dwelling construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premiers and housing Ministers of those, and other, States have called for larger <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing advances than this Bill provides for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Commonwealth’s view, large advances for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing are not the way to ensure a robust housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said in a leading daily this week that Australia’s future development, Australia’s wealth, the money that we get to spend on all of the other items contained in the Budget whether they be <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education or whatever else, comes from the pastoral and mining industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Government is one that has regard for the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation has been proved by the legislation that it intends to bring down and that has been provided for in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their confidence must be sapped and it would scarcely be surprising if they became rather bitter and anti-social, particularly when the Government that is doing nothing to alleviate their position also adopts a suspicious, if not hostile attitude to them and treats them as bludgers on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> rolls rather than as people in need of help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to this Parliament that the help thus given is more meaningful than any single social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measure introduced by the Labor Government notwithstanding its claim- its usual hollow claim- to have a monopoly of concern in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that measure, first, because it highlights the concern of the Government in this its first Budget to push ahead with its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program notwithstanding the difficult economic climate and, secondly, because it links up with the second major initiative I referred to, the indexing of personal taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Budget we should be able to read about the Government’s concern, or lack of it, for the long-term health of the individual sectors of the economy and we should find reflected the Government’s priorities in regard to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the different sectors or groups in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Precisely this: The Prime Minister came up with the idea of buying off legitimate criticism of his Government’s shabby record in the migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field by making $50,000 available to the Greek community in Melbourne and $50,000 available to the Italian community in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation applies to one of the commitments of the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  who went to the Italian community in Melbourne and made a great play of donating $5,000 to FILEF, which is an Italian <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has to be realised that there is little the Australian Government can do, other than to check on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of these people and their well-being within the prisons or wherever they may be incarcerated, when Australian citizens are apprehended overseas on drug charges; just as there is little that foreign governments can do within Australia if any of their nationals are arrested in Australia on similar charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this respect it is noteworthy that of an estimated outlay for 1976-77 totalling $24,320.9m almost half is made up by health expenditure of $2,908.7m, education $2,204m, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> $6,187.1m- and I might mention that constitutes 25 per cent of total outlays- and culture and recreation $253. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is perhaps a parallel to be seen in the treatment of government funding over several years in the field of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> where all too often we find that, notwithstanding the expenditure of unbelievable sums of money, the immediate problems of the ultimate beneficiaries appear unrelieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless that growth occurs it is impossible to do anything real in terms of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because one is merely substituting one form of expenditure for another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well remember a former honourable member for Barton, the late  Dr H.  V.

    <p>This in turn provides a major component of government revenue so that government can provide services in the areas of education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the other multitude of services that a government is expected to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Total expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is $6, 187m- almost 25 per cent of the total Budget outlay, and a 23.5 per cent increase on last year’s budgetary item. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the amount allocated for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this Budget makes the amount allocated for it only 5 years ago look like petty cash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both funds provided to the States to meet their obligations for educating our children and funds provided to colleges and universities to ensure increasing facilities for our young men and women, tike the allocations for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, make allocations a few years ago seem like petty cash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This makes even more amazing the fact that the present Government, a government which is portrayed by its opponents as having been heartless, has managed to increase expenditure in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> from the previous Labor Government expenditure of $5,000m to more than $6,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That means that this so-called heartless Liberal Government, in times of great economic difficulty, has through good management been able to increase the expenditure in the field of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> by some 25 per cent to over $6,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Irrespective of whether it is in relation to infant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the care of the aged or the supplying of hospitals and services, we still do not perform to the same standard in respect of Aborigines as we do in respect of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  pointed out that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments have been increased by 23 per cent under this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of my colleagues has pointed out very effectively that if the family allowance, which was placed there at the expense of the rebate deductions available for dependants, is removed, the expansion in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments is only 9 per cent, with an inflation rate of 12 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the expansion in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments is, of course, a reduction in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of money expended this year on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments does not equal the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not kept its promises in respect of the abolition of the means test, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or the reintroduction of fees for students at universities and centres of tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian people are entitled to expect a Budget which enshrines the principles of economic security, education opportunities, equality through social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, security of employment, and wage and income levels commensurate with skill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have promised that the wicked Government will cut expenditure on education, legal aid, Aborigines and on childhood, old people, and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they know and the people of Australia know that even in times of severe budgetary restraint we have, by our allocations in the Budget, indicated to the people of Australia that we are committed to restoring economic sanity while improving education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are very few people in Canberra who cannot get help and assistance from excellent cooperation between <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing and community based organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also recognise that only a healthy and vibrant economy can provide the resources our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies so properly call for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The young people are also taking over the production of a community newspaper, run previously by the Rockhampton Social Development Council and directed at social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> readers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leaveRecent publicity has been given to situations where residents of Australia have proceeded overseas to arrange adoptions of young persons without obtaining the necessary support of Australian child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to promote the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of situation was considered in May 1976 by a conference of Australian State and Territory social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> administrators which recommended that immigration policy should be reviewed for children subject to foreign adoption orders to allow entry only of those who have been subject to orders likely to be recognised by an Australian Court; who have been subject to orders considered unlikely to be recognised in Australia but where the adopting parents have been approved as suitable to adopt by the adoption authorities in their State or Territory of normal residence; or who have had a child-parent relationship of long standing and where refusal of entry of the child would not promote his or her <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with those principles and subject to sound health the entry to Australia of an overseas child is normally approved where the adoption proposal has the support of the child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities in the State or Territory of residence of the proposed adoptive parents, and the authorities in the overseas country in which the child is living are agreeable to the adoption being arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all adoption procedures the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child is of paramount importance and so far as inter-country adoptions are concerned the Australian Government will be guided by the views of the State or Territory child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is due ultimately to excessive wage increases and these in turn arise from the selfish, if not anti-social, behaviour of militant trade unionists who are prepared to put the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the job opportunities of their fellow workers at risk in a narrow minded attempt to increase their own real income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote the following from a booklet entitled,  Towards a New Australia,  containing an article attributed to the honourable member for Oxley and entitled  New Horizons in Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Services: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, it would be a higher priority to spend money on school dental health services and on the development of community health services- a whole range of community health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and other areas of responsibility of public office- rather than plugging benefits into a system which will just incite more utilisation because of the nature of the fee for service system and the sort of benefits that can be derived from that system because of the absence of adequate restraint on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are they concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the workers or are they engaged in a political confrontation with the Federal Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A particular fantasy relates- and it should be seen in this context- to the fact that the Government is endeavouring to divert <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a curious concept to the honourable gentlemen opposite who felt that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was something you bought votes with rather than looked after people with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have as our basic god, as our basic gaol, the purchasing of votes through the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system which was the sole motivation in assisting the middle class twoincome family at the expense of the worker in this kind of situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also asked the Union whether it would favour a situation in which the needy benefited from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and whether <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be redirected to the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply suggest to the House that the attitude held by this group of people, many of whom may well be very dedicated and may well be very good pre-school and day care teachers, that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is a bottomless pit to be sucked dry is one which cannot be allowed to persist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would urge members of the Storemen and Packers Union to think of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their fellow workers in the present circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Popular though those concessions were with so many people in the community, the really important acceptance of this Lynch Budget related to the tax indexation of personal incomes, together with the decision to increase social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in real terms, to accept a greater financial responsibility in the field of education, again in real terms, and to bring back some realism in the field of defence spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be seen as a culmination of much effort that has been put into the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the aged by members who sit in this House today representing such electorates as Mackellar, Sturt and Oxley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If effective government geared to the needs of the 1980s and beyond  is  to be achieved … if the great issues of national and local concern such as education, health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing and urban development are to receive maximum intelligent attention … if all our resources including human talents and local knowledge are to be effectively harnessed … if innovation, diversity and imaginative reforms are to be encouraged . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is implicit in the application of the federalism policy that local government must play an added role to better serve the communities in the areas of health, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing and urban and community development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time our sorts of societies, that is, Western democratic societies, have accepted the principle that those services that are seen as a necessity- services that in short we recognise as social services, such as unemployment and sickness benefits, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments of all sorts and so on- are not paid for by imposing a fiat rate tax on everybody in the same way as the contributions to the voluntary funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one accepts that then, in my view, one has to accept the thesis that that sort of service or that sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> function, if you like, should be provided out of taxation revenue and based on a sliding scale, as we accept for all other forms of social service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Liberal and Country Parties have immediately sought to revert from that system, which does represent social equity- it does, despite the honourable member for La Trobe ‘s interjection, and he recognises it for every other sphere of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> that he can think of- to the private enterprise system, which in essence is going to weigh far more heavily on the poor compared with the rich. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It came in because it knew that deficit financing, financed by a bank for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, was disastrous so far as inflationary pressures were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have a deficit of this kind not for productive services but for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, that amount of money- it was $2,648m or a lesser amount according to the amount that is properly attributable to Medibank- must have inflationary consequences for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seems to take the attitude that whereas Australian people generally accept the proposition that many things that are important to individuals and to the nation at large should be financed on a capacity to pay principle- I am referring to such matters as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, child endowment, widow pensions, age pensions, even the defence of the country and many others that come under the administration of State governmentswhen it comes to health we ought to depart from that principle and revert to a philosophy whereby people have to look after themselves and whereby a levy ought to be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill clarifies certain provisions of the principal Act- the Family Law Act- relating to maintenance and custody where the child or children concerned are in the care of State <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that position, but what I am saying is that there is Treasury interference in what is virtually a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from discussions that I have had with many of the councillors in the McMillan electorate and with representatives of the Municipal Association of Victoria that there is a belief that local government will take on greater responsibilities in the areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community planning provided it has the necessary financial resources properly to administer and implement such programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our situation profits of course contribute very greatly to all aspects of our government expenditure and, through it, to areas such as health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one Opposition spokesman has mentioned those policy measures of the last 9 months which have done more to restore economic stability and to improve equity and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Australia than any other government has achieved in a full term of office for very many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A budget that sets out to achieve the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the best objectives for the individual will be a budget which proves that at a government level the security of those individuals has best been effected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Keynesian approach would apply today because it is obvious that the author of that approach never anticipated in his time that we would have spending by governments on such a massive scale on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects and other areas that might be for the good of the people but were not productive as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further, will he urge the same Minister to ensure that the appointment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers by such organisations, as is proposed in the same annual report, is funded by the Government in addition to, and not in lieu of, assistance under the existing migrant social worker grantinaid scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we are concerned also as employers for the future and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our employees and our own children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time we have maintained an overall program of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also asked the Union whether it would favour a situation in which the needy benefited from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and whether <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be redirected to the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They struck fear into the heart and they stuck a skewer into the body of every Australian as far as the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this nation is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In government we indicated that we were intending to abolish the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the many reasons, and I shall not canvass them all, which prompted the Labor Government to establish the Commission was that we felt that for far too long the community’s attitude to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> had been determined in large measure by politicians and bureaucrats, prompted perhaps by pressures arising for support or assistance for a particular group in the community which was perceived to be suffering some severe disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advances in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> usually arise because during election campaigns politicians decide that it might be a good thing for the purpose of winning votes to make this, that or the other promise in terms of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot complain too much about that because perhaps I, as much as many other members, am in this place due to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> promises made over many years by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I still do not have to accept it as the best or ideal way to ascertain what are the real social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> requirements of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose was to look more closely at the whole network of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the country, a network which, if I might continue the image, had a hell of a lot of holes which allowed a lot of people who were in real need to fall through and not be supported in the way a modern community such as ours should support people like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a government, and then a department on the direction of the government, establishes some form of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> support, no one in the bureaucracy or even the politicians in the Government likes to acknowledge that there may be deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is fair enough, but it often proves to be insensitive to the needs of many people who slip through, who are not in fact caught in the protective device that was the point of the exercise of setting up the particular <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another facet of the Commission’s activity in the process of trying to better understand the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of ordinary members of the community, apart from the pressures of politics, was to get more local community involvement, to seek the active co-operation of the various voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies which are set up by concerned citizens because they recognise that governments are not looking after a particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far too often, if something is being done in that area, it is too easy for politicians and the bureaucrats advising them to say: ‘It is being dealt with by some nice social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> group, religious organisation, or what you will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the fundamental point the Labor Party perceived, and I like to think accepted, was that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is not a privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> services provided to the underprivileged members of a community are not a form of charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we do have unfortunate members of the community who are unable to sustain themselves- and the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission investigated a whole range of things- we are all the poorer for their suffering and misery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often they were people who, quite apart from moves made by the Government, were actively engaged in helping the voluntary social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups in their local areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inevitably, because of the nature of its actions, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was going to come into conflict with the bureaucracy at all levels and whatever political persuasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He mentioned that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits in this country were the rights of certain people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also incumbent on any society, regardless of whether it is affluent or not, to sharpen up in the provision of its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, because otherwise we are in danger of creating a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to look particularly today in speaking to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission (Repeal) Bill at the role of the Commission and its association with government and also its association with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want also to look at where the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission went wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong mentioned some of the background to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of its activities in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> context were referred to the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little later I would like to refer to the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in the context of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that it was the decision of the Labor Government to abolish the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should not be underestimated in understanding the rationalisation of establishing bodies such as the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly, although the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Australian Assistance Plan which was generally associated with the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, he made no mention of the Commission at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted also that the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was established as a statutory body, and it must be differentiated from the numerous other advisory committees or task forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act 1973 which outlines the basic functions of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) To ascertain the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the community and report these to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make recommendations for the establishment of a nationally integrated social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> plan including: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-ordination of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activities- State, local, voluntary <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant to note in the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission report covering the period to 30 June 197S that the Commission chairman, Marie Coleman, said at page 10: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, unlike the Universities Commission and the Schools Commission, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission has only advisory powers and cannot exercise executive powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission was directly responsible to the Minister for Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report reads: … the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission regards social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as a basic integrated institution in society ensuring not only the provision to all of primary material needs, but also genuine opportunities for social and cultural satisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite pertinent to quote from page 21 of the report of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the reasons for the abolition of the Commission I think they can be pin-pointed to two main areas: Firstly, the Minister for Social Security may have found the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission dysfunctional and duplicating work done by the Minister’s department, and may have found its reports contributing little to the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Commission instead of rationalising social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, only contributed further to the fragmented nature of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Commission talked a great deal about regionalisation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, it was the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration which conducted practical experiments into this procedure, which were done at Ringwood, Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which did them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission received a charter which apparently was intended to give it authority to review the whole field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and to advise on their rationalisation both from the point of view of policy content and administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It proposed an amalgamation of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission and the Health Services Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the quotation from  Sir Robert  Menzies’ speech is very pertinent to this debate today for the repeal of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission (Repeal) Bill entices one to engage in the kind of philosophical discussion that we have been listening to and I would like to proceed along those lines for a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Commission, which was established by this Parliament 3 years ago, was a concept that was related to the need to evaluate social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was part of the Labor Parry’s enterprise and interest in upgrading the whole emphasis on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and maybe it has proved to be other than the best structure or the best way to approach this problem, but it was a most laudable objective indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were very great hopes and were held not only by the Commission but also by wide-ranging groups of organisations and individuals involved in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House accepts, as it did in 1973 when the enabling legislation was passed, that there does exist a need for an independent body to examine critically on a continuing basis social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> requirements of government, we should note that the Budget allocation of a mere $75,000 to establish a policy research unit at the University of New South Wales is just not enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one questions the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, for example, in its independent research and analysis capacities, and I suggest no one could question the establishment of a similar bureau to oversee social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly in times of economic constraints the wide and ambitious plans of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission would have to be modified in the short term, but what must be retained, whatever the cost, is the capacity for such a bureau to offer the Government and the public independent analysis of Government programs and areas of need of a high quality and standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the membership of such committees is to be hand picked by the Minister rather than made up of delegates representing the organisations involved in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> undertakingsorganisations which have national, State and regional status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously there is a need to have such a counterpart in planning objectivity in respect of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, in respect of the social needs of communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had associated with it some 74 affiliated organisations, service clubs, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies and sporting organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It organised the preparation of the regional social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> directory and in general terms it rendered a very great community service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, mention must be made of Government attempts to kill the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission before the repealing legislation was even drafted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the short term at least it will provide some kind of on-going program- a link to what might be another Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission in a different form, a more effective organisation than the one contemplated at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than criticise some of the aspects of this Government’s alternative initiatives to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, he should remember that, after all, it was the Labor Government that abolished the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated by the Labor Government when the Commission was established that it was to be a bold step in policy formulation, evaluation and accountability of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to quote another reason that was given by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission in its final report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the coordination and evaluation functions of the Commission, it was not kept informed of policy program initiatives with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications prior to government decisions; it was never given the power to enforce co-ordination nor was it given an automatic right of access to Cabinet submissions on policy proposals affecting social policy, thus placing the Commission’s independent review role at serious risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission’s criticisms of those grandiose proposals, to my way of thinking, brought about its abrupt and untimely end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, to its credit, has accepted the need for evaluation and criticism of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step has been to establish a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> research unit at the University of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government is to establish national consultative groups on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> so that people with special interest at the consumer level or in the private sector generally have an ability to get through to the Minister and senior officials their opinions, views and criticisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention ACRODThe Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, ACOSS-The Australian Council of Social Services and the Council for the Aging, all of which play an important role in policy formulation, evaluation and criticism of Government <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission (Repeal) Bill before the House repeals the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission Act 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to look very briefly at one of the more important tasks of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which was the evaluation of the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Plan was an experimental program under which the Government funded community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects and the employment of community development officers who were quite often used in projects themselves funded under the Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission evaluated these projects and the effectiveness of Federal funding for local initiatives by them through a variety of voluntary bodies and local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evaluations carried out by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission have shown the hollowness of that kind of statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the clear message of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission’s work is that Federal funding is essential to the continuing viability of the community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects initiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission established in my own area the need for many of the projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many projects funded by the Federal Government under the Australian Assistance Plan and evaluated by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission obtained a large part of their costs from other Federal programs some of which are still on foot even though the appropriations for them have been cut considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those kinds of grants were essential; the work of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission clearly established that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission established that the worthwhile local initiatives and locally administered projects which were encouraged as a result of the grants from the Whitlam Labor Government are now in grave jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission established quite clearly the overlap in indentifying low income families in old, established inner city areas and new settlers in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission which is now to be abolished clearly established this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that there is a massive duplication of sources of funding available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> projects is just not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply-I thank honourable members for the contribution they made to the debate on this Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission (Repeal) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join honourable members in paying a tribute to the members of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission for the work they have already done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there has been great value to the Parliament and to all those interested in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> from the research work and the organisational work that members of the Commission have done to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Murray drew attention to the Government’s decision to set up the research unit at the New South Wales University and also the Government’s intention to establish consultative committees on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is taking steps to fulfil its commitment to provide effective mechanisms for co-operation and interchange of ideas with interested groups in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A national consultative group on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is being established to advise the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on current issues in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Membership of the group will consist of about 12 people including academics from relevant disciplines and other suitably qualified people active in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, together with representatives of national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bodies and voluntary social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course in each State and Territory a small consultative committee on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will be established to advise the Director-General of the Department of Social Security, through the appropriate State Director of the Department, on administration at the State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that there is one and I have missed it, but I still believe that this is one of the most critical areas of need in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It either comes from relatives, from some <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation, or, as in the majority of instances, it comes from the pension of the patient’s spouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The West Heidelberg Community Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Centre has been operating for some time in temporary premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I wish to make is the Government’s failure to appreciate that these community health centres are not just treatment centres but are out-reaching organisations for the community that deal with many social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Preston-Reservoir employment action group has been formed with the support of such organisations as the Intra-Church Council, a whole range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations in the area, the unemployed themselves and local service clubs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to these setimates which deal with social security, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health, I want to remind the Committee and the people of the nation that of the $24,32 lm estimated total Budget outlay, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will account for $6, 187m or 25 per cent of the amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a tremendous amount of money for any nation to spend on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health, particularly when we compare it with the education expenditure of $2, 204m and the defence expenditure of $2, 178m both of which represent approximately 9.6 per cent of the gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that we are debating the health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lone fathers and their children have been discriminated against in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation for many years by all governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This prejudice is reflected in the way <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits are provided automatically for fatherless families but not for motherless families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no question that improved income support, improved domiciliary care, improved child minding facilities and a more equitable disbursement of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds between lone fathers and lone mothers would go a long way towards relieving some of the pressures on these families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I implore the Government to take decisive action in this area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I work in a capital city electorate I have many constituents with problems in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we could choose any better field than that of health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in which to put so much money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health appropriation works out at just on 12 per cent of the total Budget outlay; social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure represents a massive 23.5 per cent of the total Budget outlay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise, and the people of Australia are going to realise, that we have the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all the people at heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the other matter that he raised about unemployment benfits, should the Budget estimate prove to be inadequate, additional funds will automatically be made available to make payments to those qualified by reason of the automatic appropriation provisions in the Social Services Act and the National <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some areas are still subject to examination- for example, by the Task Force on Co-ordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This concern was expressed by the present Government when in Opposition, as well as by many Aboriginal groups and organisations interested in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all the more important then for the Government to have the benefit of a report like  Mr Hay’s  to provide a sound administrative foundation on which to build its liberal reform and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Parliament and the people can now see the justification for the allegation by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  of waste, extravagance, duplication and over utilisation in the expenditure of funds on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people and the Parliament can now see the justification for the slashing of expenditure on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of $33m in the Budget and the abrogation of the election commitment given by the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Engage in ancillary activities such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, adoption agencies etc., but may refer clients requiring help in these areas to appropriate agencies, and undertake such liaison as is necessary to ensure access to such agencies comparable to that available to other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Speaking in the debate on the estimates for Aboriginal Affairs last year I made the point that the whole question of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginal people should not be allowed to become a party political issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been achieved for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and training of the Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds in the crucial areas of employment and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> have not been cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, funds available to the Aboriginal Legal Service have been maintained at $7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statement I made to the House today about the additional $2 5 m to be provided for Aboriginal affairs in pursuance of the undertaking by the Treasurer, I think all Aborigines and others interested in their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> can be well satisfied with the commitment of this Government to their advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being translated into seven or eight foreign languages and will be of interest to people concerned in the field of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the strict conditions laid down in that scheme whereby only social workers can be employed and not <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers have meant that many of the positions have not been filled and many useful people who could be employed by the agencies have not been employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> among migrants, which is a very important area and which requires attention even more now than it possibly did in the past, is neglected and, I am sorry to say, appears to be administered on the basis of political patronage at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation concerned indicates that this gentleman has provided a valuable service in the field of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also mentioned in some detail the situation of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers and social workers in relation to grants administered by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member mentioned the matter of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers but he should understand that until recently the rules of the scheme did not permit <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers  to  be employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if he reads the statement made by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on Budget night he will see that agreement in principle has now been obtained for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers to be employed under this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expected that a small number of grants for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers will be possible this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that the office of Governor-General must always be occupied by a distinguished Australian who must now, because of the complexities of that high office, be absolutely conversant with every section of the Constitution and ready to implement it fearlessly whenever the overriding consideration of the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Opposition never learn that it is here not as an official Opposition to the Governor-General but as the duly elected representatives of the people to make some contribution towards their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and prosperity, a task which continues to elude the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Premier of South Australia chooses not to spend his much greater amounts of money on specific things like <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, that is his responsibility and the voters can judge him on his performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is fine; that is the State’s priority, but if it had wanted to put those moneys into <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing it could have done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have no quarrel with that.- But the State made a judgment to abolish State death duties instead, and therefore it placed that particular policy item higher than <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the Government is having second thoughts about student allowances, but perhaps the question which arises is this: Are those allowances still good enough in the context of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should get rid of the phrase ‘<span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the change of the very generous Commissioner for Housing loans scheme from a general incentive scheme for relocated public servants to a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme aimed predominantly at helping the people who are most in need of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen rents on government housing increased to ensure that it is a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> scheme for those who need help rather than a handout to some people who have no claim to subsidised accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there have been increases in essential community service areas such as servicing and caretaking of government dwellings, recreational, cultural and community services, fire brigade and bus services, maintenance of parks and gardens, lighting and cleaning, police and- of very great importance- social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of housing we have introduced a policy which has a fundamental <span class="highlight">welfare</span> orientation which no one who believes in assisting those in real need could ever object to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge him to do that because the people of Australia must think that he is more interested in propping up those private funds than in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people and, more importantly, the real intelligence behind the Act which is to stop this sort of nonsense going on where false advertising can mislead the people and encourage somebody to do something against his better interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without that there is no way in which they can learn what their working conditions should be, what <span class="highlight">welfare</span> conditions there are and what health conditions there are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures illustrate the Government’s concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the handicapped and the high priority afforded the provision of adequate facilities and care to meet their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to honourable members that the Government has responded to the wishes of the Government of a small country whose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was formerly a special responsibility of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing eligibility test for pensions, which applies to all pensioners under 70 years of age except blind pensioners, it is obvious that the ‘means as assessed’ system of combining income and assets or property into a single figure for means test purposes involves anomalies and the Liberal-National Country Parties social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy provides for this to be altered to an ‘income only’ eligibility test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these changes indicate the Government’s interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those who have served their country in the Defence Force in war and peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is wedded to concepts of federalism that pre-date Federation, that will entrench State bureaucracies, that will strengthen the domination of local government by State bureaucracies to the detriment of true regionalism and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case, the Prime Minister does not think that States should choose between spending the money on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing or on rural roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is depressing, but not especially surprising, to learn that the Fraser Government’s attitude towards public funding and support of culture and the arts in Australia bears the same shortsighted, cynical and ultimately irresponsible hallmarks as do the Government’s other policies such as those to do with the economy, the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure, education, migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and so many other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Farmers really do have to ask themselves whether their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and their future have been discounted by their organisation leaders in the interests of Country Party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  consciously led Australians to believe that they were entitled to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> irrespective of whether they were in need of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a variation of the attitude which led him to tax and deficit the Australian economy into stagnation in order to provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for the middle class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that component of funding is quite irrelevant to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can contend, as honourable members do from time to time, and not only on the other side of the chamber, that we must have more <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions and more care for the aged, that we must have more expenditure on education and a wide range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must have a base on which to introduce the proper, decent and sincere feelings that we all manifest in regard to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions before we can bring them into effect, and one of the first things that this Government has to do is try to remove some of the hindrances, to try to gear rural industries to a totally new situation, because there can be no going back to the cost structure of days of the past, and to try to help these constructive industries, dollar earning industries, to get back on their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the granting of these conditions threatens to cut off the very lifeblood overseas earnings- on which we found all our expenditure in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state, we should look carefully at them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we have looked at <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should this policy be pursued recklessly, as I fear that it may be, the ultimate benefit to the people of New South Wales- the employment situation, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of many employees within the State- will be greatly damaged by that Government’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we consider that 25 per cent of our Budget goes to health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that another $2,000m goes to education- all these areas are pressing, probably quite rightly, for more and more Government expenditure- we must be conscious of some responsibility for austerity or certainly there must be a lack of extravagance in doing ail that we would like to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the possibilities for elimination of individual programs and consolidation into broader based programs in a manner which enables more efficient and economic delivery whether by the Commonwealth or the States, and the establishment of appropriate consultative arrangements with the States, local government and voluntary agencies on future policy planning, administration and service delivery in the health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development fields; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that some 25 per cent of total outlays go to social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something like 37 per cent or $9 billion of a total Budget outlay of $24.3 billion- a lot of money- is spent in the area of social security, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant and important for the Australian community to realise that the total outlay on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this Budget has been increased from $5,0 12m in 1975-76 to $6, 187m in 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-This Bill, which gives effect to the budgetary initiatives in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, continues the principle which this Government has enunciated since taking office, that is, that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be based on need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition often accuse this Government- indeed all Liberal-Country Party governments- of neglecting the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of governmental responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I support the thrust of this Government’s policy to implement its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs according to a ‘needs’ rather than a ‘rights’ basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1975, the Liberal and National Country Parties’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy stated the need for ‘protecting benefits from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting benefit levels every 6 months, according to movements in the consumer price index’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government, after almost completing its first year in office, appears to have set a strategic course designed to make <span class="highlight">welfare</span> a dirty word in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that there has been a multi-pronged assault against the concept of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> since this Government has been in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been astonished to hear some of the speeches made by members of the Opposition, who clearly are to trying create the impression, when we are on air, that the Fraser Government is making the word ‘<span class="highlight">welfare</span> ‘ a dirty word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bases of this Government’s policies are our rejection of the use of force as a proper means of solving international problems; our belief in the democratic process and the rights of people to determine their own institutions; and our deep concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the underprivileged anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It manifests itself in a denigration of ex-servicemen ‘s organisation, which have already made their contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and development of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have discussed these matters with  Mr Knox  at a Liberal Party convention in Queensland where I made it quite plain that if the Queensland Government wanted to devote more of its own funds to public works and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing it had the capacity to do so and it could have done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Queensland Government believed that it was a higher priority to put more funds into <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing or other public works, it was entitled to make that judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, even if the reason for this policy stands up to scrutiny, it is my hope that all members of this House who have the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants at heart will demand that the state of affairs which necessitates this callous policy be rectified forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the Australian Labor Party does intend to demonstrate that the Government’s proposals for allocating <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds are inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is exactly the same amount as has passed to the States for the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in each of the last 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the first year of the Labor Government we allocated $2 18m to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had agreed that if the overall situation had not improved in the second half of the financial year we would increase the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to those States where there were large resource surpluses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing was one of the Labor Government’s major achievements in changing the resource allocation in our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Australian Government deliberately aggravates the problem in Western Australia and Tasmania by increasing the amounts given to those States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, thereby adding further to the strains on the dwelling sector in those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no increased allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in that State which needs industry assistance, needs more employment opportunities and needs more <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland additional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds are justifiable on both human and economic grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is possibly why there is a waiting list for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in New South Wales of 32 000 people whereas in Victoria the figure is only 21 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The affluent and uncaring honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Baillieu)  has demonstrated his complete indifference about the needs of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he should be reminded of the fact that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  moved an amendment, the purpose of which was to indicate that there was a deficiency in funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one takes into account the fact that something like 106 000 people around Australia comprise the waiting lists of the various State housing authorities and that many more would be added to that list if people thought they had a chance of getting a house in a reasonable time, one does not need much more evidence of the need for additional funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third point stated that the distribution does not pay due regard to the nature and extent of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing needs as between the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Side by side with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, let us not forget about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing needs of our pensioners, the grand old people who have been the pathfinders and the trail blazers of yesteryear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite obviously, any refinement of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing system under the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill 1976 is to be applauded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must be cognisant of the fact that at the last census for which figures are available, that is 1971, well over 41 000 families were living more or less permanently in tents, huts caravans and house boats, and that at present, according to the latest statistics, some 1 10 000 families in Australia are waiting for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easy to offer criticism, but, as the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development quite rightly stated in his second reading speech on this Bill, the States are able to make money available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing from their own funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have the right to make money available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing out of their own funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An analysis on a  per capita  basis of the funds made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing under this Bill will indicate that Queensland obtained only $18 per head against the Australian average of $28 per head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distribution of Commonwealth funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is a highly emotional area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, despite the need to constrain public expenditure and the severity of the economies that the Commonwealth Government has imposed upon itself, the amount appropriated in this Bill for expenditure by the States on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is, whatever semantics the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  might indulge in, slightly higher than the allocation made last year by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In passing, in talking about the need to restrict government expenditure, the honourable member for Hughes must remember that in his Government’s time it also saw the need for some restraint on the rapid increases that had occurred in the allocation of funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out by the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  that the ability of the States to finance <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is not restricted by the amount of money appropriated in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One pan of the amendment was to the effect that the Government is not paying ‘due regard to the nature and extent of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing needs as between the various States’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, I have already agreed to proceed in consultation with the States towards developing a new arrangement for financing this activity in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister confirm or deny widely published reports that his Government intends to renegotiate the Commonwealth and States Housing Agreement with a view to increasing interest rates for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, raising interest rates for defence service homes, selling off land for defence service homes estates and doubling the period of service to establish eligibility for defence service homes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to this matter I think it relevant that I should read from the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy seeks to enhance the security, dignity, self-reliance and well-being of Australians  We recognise different levels of need and base our priorities on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our desire to give power and responsibility back to individuals and groups in order to effectively meet the requirements of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, distinguishes our policy from alternative approaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The National Consultative Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> is a token body giving advice only and taking only single references. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no suggestion that it will take the place of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, which the Labor Government set up and which was in a position to take a continuing over-view of policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the Bailey Committee, which is a health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> task force and about which there are a certain number of rumours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know from experience the uneven standards which will result from that and the neglect that will occur in the non-Labor States where <span class="highlight">welfare</span> rates a poor priority by State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government did that because it had to pay for another <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit, the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty- a bounty to subsidise the wealthy graziers like the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  at the expense of the aged in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Sub-normal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association operates a school for sub-normal children at Ipswich where I live, in a very old building called Claremont, an historic building, a building totally unsuitable for use as a school for sub- normal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money provided from the purchase would enable the Queensland Sub-normal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association to build a new school suitable for subnormal children, who are probably the most disabled and most disadvantaged children in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the subsidy has been reduced to $2 for $1, the Ipswich committee of the Queensland Sub-normal Children’s <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Association cannot afford to erect a school building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>As a member of the Government’s health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee I can assure the people that we show deep concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to look at the current outlays to see that this Government places a great deal of importance on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twenty-five per cent of total outlays of this Government of $24,32 lm, namely $6, 187m is being spent on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party, on the other hand, is concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people and the families involved in this section of the horticultural industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While many problems have faced fruit growers in the areas where their industry is dependent upon export markets, other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems have become evident in non-export areas due to the fact that stabilisation schemes distort the pattern of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of what the honourable member for Blaxland said, the Government is concerned for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of fruit growers and dairy farmers throughout Australia and their ability to gain unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because this Government has a deep concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners, particularly after 3 years of massive inflation which did more to damage pensions and more to damage the position of pensioners than can be conceived by people who have not been in that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are more and more parents who are concerned about the direction of education, about the fact that some of the basic skills which we in Australia for many years have taken for granted as part of the education system are not being taught and that some of the other factors to which I have referred tonight are being stressed to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the students of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, the many facets of this important and growing industry contribute to the Australian economy through: Urban and rural development; decentralisation; new and expanded employment outlets; contribution to foreign exchange earnings; avenues for profitable short and long term investment; a contribution to education; new avenues for improving community health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, both physical and mental; a deeper understanding of different cultural standards and community attitudes; and a wider base for international understanding and goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the final report of the Darwin Disaster <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Council dated March 1976, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Social Security relating to that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>many of Australia’s newspapers ran sensational stories about young and healthy ‘dole dollies’ who collect numerous <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cheques under a variety of assumed names and pool the proceeds to live in splendour along Australia’s gold coast or used their dole money to maintain comfortable existences as surf bums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it approved the establishment of 2 experimental migrant resource centres- one in Melbourne to be operated under contract by the Australian Greek <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society, and one in Sydney at a total cost not exceeding $70,000 in the current financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it agreed that the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security should draw up a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Australian Greek <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society setting out the basis of the provision of services by the Society for and on behalf of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be expected to provide a multi-lingual reference and information point for migrants, particularly in respect of services provided by Commonwealth, State and local government intrumentalities, and a range of resources which would be accessible to social workers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers working with migrants, to ethnic community leaders, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> administrators, teachers and students interested in migrant problems, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes however that it has a responsibility to assist the adjustment process by providing the financial means to ensure that resources continue to be used in those industries, where their earning power is greatest and, at the same time, provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance to those farmers so seriously affected by circumstances that they are unable to remain in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those reservations principally relate to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of officers who will be transferred out of the Commonwealth Public Service into the Northern Territory Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In many cases what the Government has on its hands is an urgent <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very recent establishment of this Department is evidence of the Government’s interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those who have served this country in the armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, behind the scenes, patient negotiation did continue between the Minister, members of the Government Members Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee and members of the Pharmacy Guild. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thank the members of the Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee, particularly the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  and the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges),  who have been most interested in this area, for the assistance that they gave to me as the Minister and to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recognised that housing was an important part of policy directed towards achievement of our equity and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an essential responsibility of a Federal government because of the vital political importance of housing for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation and because the main factor in achieving housing policy objectives is the supply and price of money for public and private housing purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This money could be used to provide more <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pressure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is enormous and this present scheme is going to put even greater pressure on this sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring now to the problem of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, when we came to power this question was tied up with the moneys made available under the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The longterm bond rate was 9.5 per cent when we went out of Government but we were making money available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing at 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year of the McMahon Government $167m was made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing but in our last year of office we made $375m available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 3 years we had increased the amount from S167m to $375m and the terms and conditions under which we made that money available were of great assistance to the States in trying to overcome the backlog of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People earning up to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings were able to apply for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But funds in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field were cut from $175m down to $2 5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned, we are continuing our agreements with the States to provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, in the next year or so, the discussions and negotiations that we are having with the States will result in a much more effective delivery of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing through StateFederal co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjustments to the personal income tan system which ostensibly gives individuals greater ‘ independence ‘ in spending power to meet their own needs do nothing to assist those who are not wage earners and those whose income (be it wages or a pension) is inadequate to enable them to live decently and disguises the fact that important <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and human services are either not available or become effectively inaccessible to the public who need them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least three of the provisions I have mentioned were the subject of investigation, report and recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission; that is, expenditure on mineral petroleum development to be deductible from income derived from any source, allowable capital expenditure by petroleum companies to be deductible from income derived from any source, allowable capital expenditure to be extended to cover expenditure on ports and related facilities including housing and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facilities located at the port site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures announced under the household support provision also receive the support of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having seen more than 2000 farmers on the dole in its time of tenure or office, the Government is duty bound to provide suitable <span class="highlight">welfare</span> proposals to maintain the income of farmers who are judged to be nonviable, up to the level of unemployment benefit prevailing in the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally we found that they had a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problem on their hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Social Security has recently conducted a staff utilisation review of its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That division has been decimated by the Government’s abandonment of the Australian assistance plan and the remnants of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission, and further changes are mooted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, incredibly, the staff utilisation review of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Division of the Department of Social Security is in the process of recommending that the branch be disbanded and absorbed into a new structure not recognising a specifically migrant oriented branch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As tomorrow’s  Hansard  will show,  Senator Guilfoyle,  in answer to a question from  Senator Mulvihill  in another place, today expressed her unqualified opinion that an identifiable migrant-oriented <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service needs to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can think of no reason for it, unless migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is deemed a less important consideration than minor administrative convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this really a ploy to take migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> out of that Department without the Minister’s knowledge, so that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, with its four or five relevant officers, can establish a monopoly over ethnic affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Human dignity and the exercise of free choice consistent with over-all public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> are basic rights which must be assured in every society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such policies must be an essential component of an over-all development strategy, linking and harmonising them with policies on industrialisation, agriculture, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and environmental and cultural preservation so that each supports the other in a progressive improvement in wellbeing of all mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Timely government intervention can provide <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance to seriously affected farmers as well as providing the financial means to ensure that resources continue to be used in those industries where their earning power is greatest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second aspect of a complete package of agricultural policies is <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past, Liberal and National Country Party governments have not placed sufficient emphasis on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy, and I acknowledge the criticism that has come from Labor spokesmen in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, even though the Labor Party said that it would do more in regard to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy in agriculture, it did not do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who live in rural communities, whether they live on farms or in country towns, need such things as communications, telephones, transport, fuel prices equalisation, reasonable educational opportunities and special health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I compliment the Minister and the Government for putting together what I consider to be a great improvement in adjustment measures for the agricultural sector of our society and for some very important innovations and developments in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is important always when discussing what may be the problems of high tariff in Australia also to discuss the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the wellbeing of the people who are involved and affected by decisions which are taken by governments <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is so much hogwash for the Government continually to use the 25 per cent tariff cut as the basis for saying that the Opposition does not think about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of industry or the people who work in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has informed me that the Australian Telecommunications Commission intends approaching the various social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments- the Department of Social Security, the Department of Health and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs- to investigate whether or not they will be prepared to assist possible users financially by subsidising purchases or rentals of these devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This fall in living standards- this slide in personal incomes and individual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and security- is so novel and dramatic a phenomenon that the Australian people have yet to grasp its implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factors to be considered in this regard go well beyond the grant of assisted passages to Australia and include placement in employment in Australia which is significantly difficult at present and an assessment of the degree of reliance which any group may have on continuing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-86-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My grievance is that the Fraser Government unilaterally is trying to force the State governments of Australia to agree to the changing of the existing CommonwealthState Housing Agreement in a way that will create hardship for many existing tenants of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and will create inequity between the needy poor and other less affluent people in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government is intent upon forcing the States to pay the long term bond interest rate of 10.5 per cent per annum on loans for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the tenants of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing will pay rents at the current market level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than attacking the Labor Premiers who have these and other doubts over the end result of the Fraser Government’s proposal, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development would be more productive if he ensured that studies were undertaken correlating the cost benefit and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications of alternatives to the existing scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have always kept interest rates for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing program at a high level, generally providing only a one per cent advantage against the bond rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall the decision to establish the Task Force on Co-ordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health arose out of the Government’s concern at the proliferation, duplication and overlap of Commonwealth programs and services in the health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report also contains a range of other recommendations relating to specific programs including, for example, pathology laboratories, rehabilitation centres, and the immediate post-arrival <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In proposing various administrative changes, both reports make suggestions as to how the Commonwealth can safeguard the role of local and voluntary agencies delivering health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our view is that these reports raise important issues in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fields which merit serious consideration, not only by governments but also by all those involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The terms of reference of the Task Force directed it to look at ways of co-ordinating <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs ‘having in mind that coordination could be effected at the State and local government level without Commonwealth involvement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that new ventures in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or security, as in housing, higher education or transport, have, ever since the Second World War, always come from the Federal GovernmentLiberal or Labor- and the original funding for them has come from the Federal GovernmentLiberal or Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already there have been a number of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs amalgamated or transferred to the States by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After consultations with interested groups and a report from the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Commission recommending its retention, the Minister for Social Security announced on 21 May 1976 that the Government would not continue to fund the program beyond June this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perfectly clear that the Fraser Government is obsessively concerned with administrative arrangements and with reducing federal expenditure rather than with providing effective social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Overlap and duplication can be eliminated with planning and goodwill, but without a commitment- a sharing- by the Federal Government it is much harder to close the gaps in health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Fraser Government has sought to do is reverse the historic consensus of a generation of Australian politics, the principle adhered to by successive Labor and Liberal governments, ever since the Second World War that the prime responsibility for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and security, and for all reforms and initiatives in this field, rests with the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That where rebates are transferred to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments the transfer compensates for the value of the rebates for each taxpayer or the household supported by the taxpayer; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only does Australia according to a recent World Bank survey have a more equal distribution of income than almost any other country in the world but also I believe there is merit in the suggestion that Australia’s adoption of a basically selective approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is largely responsible for the fact that the incidence of poverty in Australia is lower than in any country with the possible exception of the Scandinavian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> allows a greater degree of flexibility for the Government to address itself to new areas of need as they arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These and other areas of need I feel sure can be better catered for by the flexibility which is inherent in the Government’s needs based <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is evidence to sustain my belief that at this time in our nation’s history there is a great opportunity for the major political parties, ibr management and for unions in particular to reach a consensus that the future <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our citizens will depend to a large extent on giving them the opportunity to work and thereby to live productive and useful lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the enormous achievements of our nation in the last 25 years and despite our extremely high standard of living compared with many countries, the Henderson report identified areas of major concern and deficiencies in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> structure, This was despite the universal philosophy of spending money on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> became a self-sustaining bureaucracy with a huge share of the Government money going to social workers, administrators, researchers and consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was interested in his early comments in which he stated that the former Labor Government was elected in December 1972 because of the appeal of its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst one can understand that people will support a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program, I assure him that one of the reasons that his Government was elected in December 1972 was that it had been out of office for 23 years and the Australian people had forgotten what it would mean to have a profligate socialist government on the treasury benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When all is said and done, we should not be staggered or surprised if this Government were to bring the rate of interest for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to a level near that of the bond rate, because that is what was done for 23 years under a Liberal-Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of private members being active in the Parliament to examine legislation, to discuss reports, to discuss ministerial statements and so on, there is a tendency for them to want to be back in the electorate serving the social worker or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker functions there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In plain terms we have a dishonest and discredited Government, a Government of lies and broken promises, a Government that is driving Australia into deeper recession and decline, a Government that is wilfully neglecting the urgent needs of the Australian people, a Government renouncing all responsibility for national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and national progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we can bring these people under notice very early and not put them away behind bars in prisons but restore them to the work force, under surveillance, with the necessary support from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> societies and educationalists, it would save an enormous amount of money and a lot of human material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The IAC report reflects a complete lack of optimism about the future of the industry, it ignores confirmed market potential, it proposes a costly, complex and ill-considered <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system for individuals rather than product assistance to stabilise the industry itself . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same honourable member for Blaxland had this to say: … a scheme like the current one which is production orientated gives the larger grower a larger proportion of the funds available and the smaller grower receives only a small amount of the funds available which, in many cases, just becomes a form of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance rather than viable support - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Blaxland, who poses as the great friend of primary industry, who stands in this Parliament and claims to have a vested interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of primary industry, is on record as having said last year that he regarded this sort of stabilisation scheme as a form of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance, a dole for the fruit growers, a hand-out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Gietzelt,  the Opposition spokesman on primary industry matters in the Senate, made a magnificent contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the fruit industry when last year he said that the Opposition would not oppose the legislation- not that it supported it, but that it would not oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The honourable gentleman is seeking to confuse comments I made last weekend in relation to the question of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated that Commonwealth expenditure on education, housing, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will amount to almost $12 billion or about one-half of expected total outlays in this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The dramatic expansion of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs over recent years is a very important, if not the principal, reason why such a heavy burden has been placed on Australian taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite contrary to what I said, the program sought to give the impression that the Government would be looking to cut out those programs that are fulfilling an important role in the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What must be understood is that the Government has an obligation to ensure that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs are not rendered inefficient by excessive administration and delivery costs, such as those that occurred under the former Administration, and that they are not directed towards those in the Australian community who have a capacity to look after themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of life we enjoy, the structure, the efficiency of our manufacturing industries, the distribution of and the demand for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, the role that Australia will play as a member of the international community- in short, Australia’s population policies-are central to the population decisions of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any event, incentives to have larger families could be very costly, even to the point of drawing resources away from other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are that there are not viable plans for solving inflation, that there is not a solitary care for unemployed people, that there is no semblance of planning or concern in the fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health, urban planning, Aboriginal affairs, the aged or education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of his address to the Victorian State Council of the Liberal Party in which he foreshadowed further reductions in expenditure on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in this year’s Budget, I ask: Will he assure the House that the Government will not restore the means test on pensions for persons over the age of 70 years or reintroduce university fees and loans in breach of the 1975 election commitments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The lesson to be learnt from any universal health insurance system around the world is that unless there are proper inbuilt cost constraint mechanisms- I know that the honourable member for Oxley agrees with this- clearly the cost will get completely out of hand and will consume the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me assure the honourable member for Oxley that Sweden is in deep trouble with too much social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> being at the root cause of its troubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only matter which could possibly be referred to as an initiative was a clear indication that social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which were initiated by the Labor Government would be axed still further and that people who were deserving of assistance were to be deprived still further of a reasonable degree of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  who will follow me whether he would care to explain how as a government they would increase dramatically spending on education, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing, local government, and grants to the States, and how they would give indirect and direct tax cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a figure which has no regard for the present economic and employment situation in Australia and which certainly has no regard for the way in which we will see to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> once they get here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly we did not do enough but we were working on significant new directions in migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community relations when the present Government conned its way into office on the pretext that it could run everything much better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is going through a public relations exercise of establishing concurrently 2 experimental migrant resource centres, one in Melbourne, which is to be operated under contract by the Australian Greek <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society, and one in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those centres are supposed to provide all sorts of services to migrants, to assist social workers and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, and to draw attention to the particular problems of ethnic communities and individual migrants requiring government action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of some indication that the Government will assist the many children and adults with learning difficulties the Treasurer offers the prospect of further massive reductions in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very easy for a government to win electoral appeal by increasing education spending, by increasing health spending, by increasing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending or by increasing subsidies to a number of industries and concessions to many employment areas in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need today more than ever before for people themselves to be their own initiators, for people themselves to strive to become independent, for people themselves to become less dependent on governments, but at the same time, there is a need today for governments to keep out of people’s lives, except of course in those cases of extreme hardship where the society as a whole accepts a responsibility for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The wrecking of Medibank is an attack on women; the neglect of the cities is an attack on women; the Fraser Government’s onslaught on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, urban transport, sewerage programs, area improvement, environmental and recreational programs are attacks on the living standards of everyone, men and women alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reform that was introduced last year, to change the basis of family allowances, I believe, was probably the most significant single social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> reform since Federation especially to help women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The view that I have just expressed on the basis of the recommendations of the Poverty Commission was further supported in the paper by that Commission entitled  The <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> of Migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Instead we are asked to believe that a Government that runs down the aid program, that fails to spend even the meagre funds on foreign aid allocated in its own Budget and dismantles the expert, independent body set up to administer foreign aid is somehow committed to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our neighbours and the needy countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our objective to increase our aid commitment as far as we can possibly do so, keeping in mind the fact that we have to run the Australian economy, deal with the numerous social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems that we have in Australia, as well as pull our weight internationally and assist those countries, many of which are far worse off than ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The low foreign exchange earnings of those nations and the huge foreign debts which they have regrettably had to run up since independence will continue to remain a major difficulty in their overall economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to recognise the administration of our economic aid programs is based on the view that improvements in aid must be affected in almost all aspects of our aid endeavours- in the machinery for formulating policy, in ensuring greater attention to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various schemes, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that we cannot just seek to push for our own development in this selfish fashion, recognising that we have a lot of unemployed that we cannot accommodate, that we have an increasing aged population, that somehow they will have to survive on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and that we will have to maintain our own productive sections of the community by bringing in trained migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new federalism means dual taxation; it means double taxation; it means the end of the system of uniform taxation which has served Australia well since World War II; it means the withdrawal of the Federal Government from all creative programs and all responsibilities for the people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the nation’s advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Uniform taxation was introduced in this country because we recognised, as a nation, that the States were so disparate and diverse, so unequal in their populations and their tax resources, that without a coordinating and overriding Federal responsibility for growth, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and development, the very ideal of federation would be at risk; pressures and disparaties among the States would produce a grossly unequal and therefore divided nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Special arrangements within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be made by a Liberal/ National Country Party government to provide both a reference point for individual migrants problems and assist the many migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Liberal/National Country Party government will assist and encourage industry to provide migrant advisory services and assistance schemes within their own structure and generally take a greater responsibility for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrant workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill does raise some important questions about the future of the Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and housing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bailey report recommended that it be included in a comprehensive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government might use this program to reduce the criticism which very substantial changes to the long accepted <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing policies will bring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the recommendations in the Bailey and Holmes reports are sounder in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> terms than what the bureaucracy is proposing and the Minister should not cut off these options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The efforts that this Government will be putting into getting a satisfactory, worthwhile solution to the various problems in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing field shows that the Government regards this as an absolute top priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that many people enjoying the benefits of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs in the various States are in a financial position to make more of a contribution towards either the rent or the repayments on the homes they are occupying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for members of the Opposition and State Labor Party Premiers to mischievously claim that the Government is determined to increase the rents for people in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government believes determinedly is that the people who should have first access to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing units and the people who should be paying nothing more than the minimum repayment or the minimum rent should be the people who have the greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard nothing in this regard except abuse in the Press from State Premiers who are taking cheap political points on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing by claiming that the Fraser Government is seeking simply to increase the repayments and other dues of people who are in needy circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also reinforce the point that this Minister and this Government are interested in both the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and private housing sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are determined to see that in the course of this Liberal-National Country Party Government and the next one, that the percentage of people who can get into a position of home ownership increases dramatically and that the benefits to be obtained from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs go to those people in the greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As one who has been genuinely committed to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of pensioners and the under-privileged since I first came into Parliament 1 1 years ago, may I say that I support the legislation and I congratulate the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  on the manner in which he is performing the duties of his portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are complaining because the Minister has arranged and the Government has commissioned the preparation of some very important reports on the future of this type of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the subject of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is above and beyond party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to what  Mr Holgate  has said in Tasmania, namely that ‘in my opinion the Federal Government is progressively trying to opt out of government housing leaving the States to accept the financial burden’ and ‘that is why  Mr Newman  wants to cut off our supply of low interest money which we depend upon so much to charge reasonable rents’ this Government, under this Minister, is determined to get better value for its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the Bill will extend the scheme from 3 years to 4 years and will pump $10m into <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing for single pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned 2 reports- the Task Force on Coordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health, known as the Bailey report, and the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care of the Aged and Infirm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the field of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> it offers a new hope to an Australian marching towards the twenty-first century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixthly, towards the end of this century Australia will need to spend relatively more on such things as aged pensions and other age related <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes and relatively less- I am sad to say this- on such things as child endowment, education, creches and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bailey Task Force has proposed the establishment of a SHACC- that is, sheltered accommodationprogram as one of 4 programs in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I believe, in the approach and the commitment of our Government that we have demonstrated to the pensioners of Australia, to the poor of Australia, and to the under-privileged of Australia that we have a genuine commitment to their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and to their betterment, that we are determined that they shall be properly and appropriately housed, and that they shall be cared for in the twilight years of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, quite wisely, has extended the thrust of the legislation in time to give the States the opportunity to continue their uncompleted programs while a reappraisal of housing on a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> basis is being carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Bill to extend the period of operation of the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974 for 12 months to 30 June 1978 because self-contained units for pensioners entitled to supplementary benefits are an urgently needed health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the inception of the North West Regional Council for Social Development over the last 3 years or so activity in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field has increased dramatically to the benefit of the people in such areas as the development of the central services and the raising of the quality of life in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Government does apply the same cnterion when it is thinking of cutting expenditure on education, health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and when it is increasing the problems we face by ensuring that the numbers of students at our schools and tertiary institutions are maintained at much higher numbers than is necessary because of the lack of opportunities it creates for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the extension of those standards to Commonwealth Government contractors, employees engaged in the Territories and interstate trade and commerce poses jurisdictional questions, but with the co-operation of the State Ministers for Labour, considerable progress is being made in the development of uniform safety, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 5 October last year the Minister tabled the Hay report, fully 4 months after the Government had received it, and announced that an additional $25m was to be appropriated for expenditure on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one other matter which I think is a crying shame when we consider social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The emphasis of the AUS, despite the fact that it is supposed to be orientated towards the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australian students, has in recent years become more clearly identified with the interests of people and groups who have no affinity whatsoever with Australian university students, their interests or the interests of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Broadly speaking the objectives of the Union are to promote the educational <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and political objectives of students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I emphasise the point I made earlier: I wonder precisely what responsibility this should be for the AUS which is, ostensibly, in terms of its own charter, responsible for the activities and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australian university students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through this machine the executive informs students of their own private political opinions on questions not related to student <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the great bulk of students are committed to high academic achievement which will enable them to make long term contributions both to Australia’s and their own <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The executive ‘s pre-occupation with itself, and the promotion of its extreme political views and its lack of concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of average students is clearly demonstrated in a breakup of this budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against this expenditure only $1,000 was applied to the solution of a problem such as the tertiary education assistance scheme, an issue, of course, which affected the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of most students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can effectively represent students in the genuine needs which they have and not be purely an extremist political organisation concerned with promoting extremist political views in the community to the detriment of the overall community and, of course, to the detriment of students who depend on that body for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It reflects the decrease in tax receipts and the increase in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments arising out of a recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Liberal scheme of priorities the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the security and the future happiness of Australian youth are subordinated to an obsession with corporate profits and a heartless manipulation of the Federal deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, on the other hand, taxpayers increased their spending, the national income would increase, Government revenues would grow and expenditure on unemployment and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would decrease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In assessing whether the Australian Government should continue to provide assistance for the consumption of phosphatic fertilisers, the Commission has considered both the economic efficiency and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any suggestions to that effect from the gallant  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  or the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Hughes, would be slightly unfair and perhaps reveal that they are not as informed on the matter of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the ex-servicemen of this country as they might well be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface it by reminding him that the Bailey inquiry which examined the proposed transfer of a large number of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services from the Federal Government to the State governments specifically commented that this transfer could be implemented successfully only if agreements were entered into concerning financial and other administrative arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could be described as the rejects of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system supposedly set up to care for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the amount of money provided to a man with 2 children- the figures have been frequently quoted by various people in this place- and at the amount of money which it is claimed by various people in this place is the cost of protection, we find that it is far more expensive to pay a person unemployment benefit, service his family with the $7.50 allowance per child, and supply the free services which are provided under the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program than it is to have a protected industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in addition to that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> costs another $6 billion or 25 per cent of Government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the long run, if we removed these barriers- physical, social and economic- that exist, perhaps we would have far less need to have defence expenditure as the biggest item in our Budget after social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In every field- secondary and tertiary education, sport, recreation, the club movement- he was an active and forceful promoter of the interests and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Wollongong and all its residents- those who were born there and those who had come there from other parts of Australia as well as from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody hearing or reading the Treasurer’s Budget Speech could realise that there has been a tremendous squeeze on the States and local government; that the Government has broken its promises on education spending; that spending on health programs is down; that the provision for pensioner dwellings is down by 18 per cent in real terms; that funds for Aboriginal advancement are down 16 per cent in real terms; that provision for urban public transport has been cut by 25 per cent in real terms and funds for leisure and recreation facilities by 60 per cent in real terms; that urban programs have virtually disappeared; that the national sewerage program has been abandoned; that all migrants’ special serviceseducation, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing, health, languagehave been cut; that the growth centre agreements with the States have been unilaterally repudiated; that environment programs suffered cuts ranging from 24 per cent to 99 per cent in real terms; that the area improvement program has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have achieved that without reducing expenditures across the areas embraced by the Budget in the more significant fields of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, transport and industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the anatomy of the Budget one finds that over two-thirds of total Federal expenditure is accounted for by education, which takes 8.9 per cent; health, which takes 10.6 per cent; social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which take 27.2 per cent, and payments to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, government expenditure has increased by 13 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that a community of some 14 million people cannot be expected to support such a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state indefinitely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With that objective in mind, we have ensured that all essential social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs have been continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs have been linked in with indexation so that when the consumer price index increases due to inflation people in receipt of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar lose nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is because we believe it is fundamentally important, even in these difficult times, that the people of Australia should be made to believe that this Government is concerned for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has flowed from four fundamental considerations: the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers region and of all other prople living in the region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accepting the responsibility of further uranium development we will ensure that that development will be very strictly controlled, with the fullest and most effective protection for the environment and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have specific arrangements to ensure Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely in accord with the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry and will provide a proper and adequate basis on which uranium development will proceed so as to harmonise the interests of development, environmental protection, National Park values and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Ranger Inquiry’s report ‘the principal threat to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people, and the one they most fear, is constituted by the large numbers of people who can be expected to enter the area’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nursing home benefits arrangements for which the Bill provides represent a major advance in the Government’s health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program introducing a new era of financial security for nursing home patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of my concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of nursing home patients, I have written a letter to all patients to reassure them that the proposed changes to the nursing home arrangements will advantage them as patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many cuts in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can see that the Government has nothing to boast about in its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arguments relating to the environment and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people are tremendously compelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The excessive consumption of alcohol by a large proportion of Aboriginal people is having a deleterious effect on general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would dearly love to have the opportunity to speak about other aspects of this report which relate to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Recent express decisions by the Government have callously disregarded the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of rural people and rural producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, expenditure on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is up 12.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance to the States which contribute so much in the administration of the services essential in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, health, employment and all the rest of it, has increased by 14 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their propaganda was so effective that many of the small businessmen did not stop to ask what was going to replace the sudden stoppage of public works when hospitals, schools, preschools, aged persons accommodation, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, growth centres, sewerage works and employment creation schemes were stopped or cut back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator River region, and of all other people living in the region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the need to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; and the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and interests of the Aboriginal people and all other people working on development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the iterim we have seen an extensive media campaign mounted by the Uranium Producers Forum in an attempt to convince people that there are no real dangers involved in the use of uranium, that it is just another energy source, or in the disposal of nuclear waste: that the mass of the people will benefit from uranium by increased employment opportunities, by social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have expressed their very serious concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their children and their grandchildren and for the future of humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Economically, the export of uranium is of great importance to the future prosperity and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was later asked to return to Australia for a certain period to assist in establishing a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> office for the Italian communities in the areas of Coburg and Brunswick and also to establish a newspaper in the Italian language so that these people would be assisted in their integration into Australia society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So in February 1974  Mr Salemi  came back to Australia and helped to establish a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> office in Coburg. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They developed a pride in the centre for it was a free <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agency which they had established themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when the Labor Government, in cooperation with the State Government, started the north west one-stop <span class="highlight">welfare</span> shop, commonly known as NOW, they continued to throng to the FILEF <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we would like to see more money going into all sorts of areas- education, local government, roads, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending will increase by 12.7 per cent in 1977- 78 following an increase of 27 per cent last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> migrant facilities and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> rights services have been reduced by 12 per cent in real terms from a miserable $800,000 last year to an even more miserable $750,000 this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We urge the Government to grant extensive government assistance to migrants in housing and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports make numerous recommendations on migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> but they are too numerous for me to mention here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This area is also extensively covered in the Bailey report on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health and in numerous other reports which have been prepared for the Government in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that future restraint should be exercised more heavily on transfer payments, by adhering to the principle that resources in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area should be more heavily concentrated on areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax cuts, justifiable on equity and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> grounds, will not have their desired expansionary impact on the economy unless two things happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to spend my remaining time discussing some of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> this Government has a fine record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, its objective of reducing the inflation rate has very substantial advantageous <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications for pensioners and all elderly, retired people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other more direct ways in which this Government has protected disadvantaged groups through its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two areas in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field which concern me particularly and on which I urge the Government to take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that this is a major anomaly in our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matter relates to the problems experienced by some pensioners who are in receipt of a part pension and some additional income, whether it is derived from superannuation or from some other source, and who are entitled to receive certain fringe benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, because of this problem many pensioners are having their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> determined less by changes in their basic income levels and more by the absence of change in their entitlement to fringe benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time as the Government was pruning back community services, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and wages, it was doling out money to big business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great slashing of migrant services in terms of education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and language training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The belief that government expenditure is evil or wrong or has an insidious effect upon the community’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is totally wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the very basis of the supply of all our social needs- education, health and all <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goods came into the country which had been manufactured by a work force getting $A 1 2 a month, with no workers’ compensation and no social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hasten to add that local authorities in the United States and Canada have responsibility, of course, for functions such as police and justice, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, housing and urban renewal and in some cases, education which Australia does not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer firstly to the Municipal Association of Victoria and its approach to the first Bailey report from the Commonwealth Task Force on co-ordination in Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I respectfully agree with the Municipal Association m its conclusion that the implications of the Bailey report recommendations are wide-ranging and of substantial significance to the delivery of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local Government is now involved with planning for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An increasing range of grants from Commonwealth and State sources nas expanded the role of local government in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It works from the general policy position on local government encompassed in its Federalism and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits are indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become unfashionable for the fact to be recognised that the middle income and higher income earners are bearing the greatest proportion of tax in each dollar earned, which goes towards our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program and towards the total federal revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were not looking for handouts, the method adopted in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen from the statement that the transfer covers a wide range of important functions such as primary industry, child, family and community <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, payroll tax and stamp duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of thousands of whole communities in Australia and to decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The provisions of the two Bills fulfil the stated aims of the Government in regard to this area of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, what he fails to tell this nation is that most of the health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> advances in this country were instituted by a Liberal-Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable gentleman is well known in this House and in his electorate for the particular interest that he takes in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters generally and I welcome the interest which he has again expressed in the taxation position of elderly citizens, particularly age pensioners, throughout the Australian community and especially in the electorate of La Trobe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that it is an ostrich attitude for people to bury their heads in the sand if they really believe in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of South Australia and the development of opportunities in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a co-ordinated approach to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the working people in terms of jobs which may be lost as a result of lowering protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are more concerned with pursuing their philosophy than with looking after the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals envisage the delegation of wide policy and executive responsibility for important functions such as health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, public transport, the Australian Capital Territory police, municipal services, the present government housing operations and many other services of government in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be expected that the Government would be looking to the same general processes of refinement in high expenditure areas here including education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It demands that unless we become greater producers of other natural assets we as a Government and as a people will have to transfer financial resources from some of our priority areas- these could well be in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sectors- towards greater costs of the basic fuel research and development of and providing for alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the fact that in a recession government expenditure automatically rises through increased <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, and receipts fall through lower tax receipts, calculations are made to obtain what the budgetary position of present expenditure and receipt patterns would be at the position of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of both parents from the home leads to increased demands for child care facilities and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services which are provided as a matter of course in the traditional one income family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowance system introduced last year was a significant social reform but many of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> activists in our community have not given sufficient credit to the Government for that reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without the ability to make a worthwhile contribution to general <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which is so important in the world today, we soon could find ourselves becoming a second rate nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at living standards- a fundamental indicator of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people in this country- we see that in the 12 months to June 1975 real household disposable income, that is the real income which people had in their hands to spend, went up by 5.1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It took place in this Parliament at 1.14 a.m. because even then the Government of the day, which was of the same political complexion as the present Government, had no idea at all of and no interest in the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia or, indeed, of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government’s aim, however, continues to be to maintain activity in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing area on an even keel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Information on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing activity in 1976-77 provided by the States indicates that loans made from Home Builders’ Account moneys were responsible for completion or purchase of 9,475 homes and, in addition, the State housing authorities commenced 9,420 dwellings and completed 8,530 dwellings in the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision will enable the Treasurer to continue payments to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing after the expiration of the current Agreement on 30 June 1978 until legislation for a new agreement, and an appropriation measure for 1978-79 pursuant to the new agreement, are passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt when that scheme was first thought up it was a very desirable initiative, but at that stage when I was not in this House but was an ordinary member of the community it seemed to me that a large number of people at public expense were learning macrame work, attending pottery classes and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> courses and a few other things which no doubt in an ideal society might be desirable things for them to pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is tremendously significant to improve the flexibility, the reduction in overlap or duplication and the position generally in a whole range of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services of a federalist nature, as I believe some of these recommendations are, which may be implemented by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the States, which are now $640.5m better off as a result of the Fraser federalism policies, should be playing a greater role than they have played in the past in looking after the health, education and other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of the people who live within their States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shift to the private sector ignores the basic fact that the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is a public responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill moves into the area of the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States for the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and assistance to the States in the housing area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The traditional form of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Australia is that the Federal Government channels money to the States, which then use housing commissions as construction and allocation agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of these tenants are reliant upon Commonwealth social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and, indeed, are in need of assistance in providing a home for their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the Government that he supports has provided less money this year for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing that it provided last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the fact that this Bill does not make sufficient funds available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in any of the States, it does not make funds available that are comparable with those of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the migrant services outreach program has been taken from a competent migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer and placed in the hands of a woman with no casework or community work experience with migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is reflected in the section’s channelisation into the benefits and pensions issue of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, rather than the integration and settlement areas which are the section’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member made the point about what he called migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> courses begun under Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been checking to find out about these migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> courses and I find that the reference is probably to a course of training for bilingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers who were to be recruited to the Department of Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that no further training took place during the Labor Government’s term of office or since December 1975 because no new group of bilingual <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers has been recruited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr lnnes)  said, there are far too many bureaucrats here in Canberra and far too many people in supervisory roles in the State offices of the Department of Social Security who are responsible for the provision of migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and who are not familiar with what is going on in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that all housing rentals should go up to pretty close to market value but that those people who cannot afford to pay that value should be subsidised on a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> basis by a rental rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with our policy of concentrating <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance on people in the greatest need, the Government is in favour of making the Act more effective in meeting the needs of a wider range of homeless people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We called it the Special Broadcasting Service because it may well prove desirable for the Government, in the years ahead, if there is a request, to provide some special broadcasting service for example, to the Aborigines throughout Australia or to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened now, in fact, is that the Government feels, because of the calling of the early election, it has not been able to come to a decision on the recommendation of the so-called Bailey report- the report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>- in which it is suggested that there be a much wider homeless persons assistance program incorporated in what is called a sheltered accommodation program and some re-organisation, with the help of the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But judging from the non-specific nature of the proposals for action and worse the indication that even more dependence will be placed on ‘non-government migrant resource centres’ any migrant with any insight can only conclude that little or nothing will be done for 20 per cent of the population suffering disadvantages through barriers of language, in areas or health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and job opportunities, just to name a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been approached by the Federal Council of Polish Associations in Australia, supported by the Polish branch of the RAAF Association, the RSL Polish Branch, the Polish Club Ltd, the ExServicemen’s Association of the Polish Home Army, the Polish Association in New South Wales and the Polish Educational Society in New South Wales about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems facing the Polish community in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want a detailed survey of their needs; the establishment of a Polish-oriented psychiatric unit; the urgent appointment of an interpreter to the New South Wales Health Commission as an interim measure until the establishment of the psychiatric unit; the appointment of a full time Polish speaking social worker under the GIA scheme and funding for the Polish <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Information Bureau in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because they were independent people, they generally looked after their own <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, at the same time as they are looking at the problems of the Polish people within Australia, they might as well look at the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems of the whole of the ethnic communities because most ethnic communities here face problems similar to those faced by the Polish community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why they have this incredible paranoia about the Prime Minister, the man who brought this country out of the mire into which the Labor Government had plunged it and the man who has ensured its economic future and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will allow for a more sensitive application of funds for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits and the more efficient use of our huge resource of dedicated volunteers in the charity field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My electorate is one of the first to feel the chill of a government which puts social justice at the tail end of its priorities- a government whose harsh policies are actually fermenting social disorder, a government which directs its public servants in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area to stick to the letter of the law and to throw compassion and decency to the wind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I know no one in Australia has come up with scientific evidence on the relationship between an intangible, such as work incentives, and the way it is affected by the availability of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general conclusion is that for other than a minimal number of people there is little data to suggest that there is a strong link between nonparticipation in the work force and the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1 976, because of the flow-on of enormous amounts of money allocated to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing by the Whitlam Labor Government, 12.2 per cent of housing was built by the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977-78 only 1.46 per cent of the Budget was allocated for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to upgrade the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More houses must be built in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> section, and there should be an immediate increase in the allocation of funds to the State housing authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long term policy should be to put more money into the public sector, because the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing sector needs money more urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> housing policies of the previous Labor Government ignored those within the community who were in greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is simply a Fraser Government device to get <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing out of the custodial care of the corporate caring process of governments and into the hands of the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the public housing area- the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- we must recognise the Government’s sympathy for those people who do not have the capacity for home ownership and who need shelter, encouragement and provisions for the growth of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In taking a decision, the union executive must take into account the business situation of the firm concerned, the general economic situation, and the public’s  <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been referring only to the economic benefits of tourism, but what of the benefits to the health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education of our people, not to mention the goodwill and understanding gained from international visitations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, are we really doing much to encourage self-reliance by the way the social services system is structured, with a claim being made, an examination of the claim, followed by a straight payment of money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have become so preoccupied with the need for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and support of one means or another that we find now that there is virtually a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now given such an impetus to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> establishment that we run the risk of encouraging a dependent mentality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be examining, for instance, why it is that almost every day in this place- at least in my case- we are deluged with reports and surveys of one sort or another on matters of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be examining the subjects of health care, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education and many of the other sacrosanct areas of government expenditure to see whether there is a better way of achieving the same desirable end- a method of helping those who really need help, yet at the same time encouraging their self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have come no longer to debate whether social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> ought to be directed to the needy and how we ought to do this, but to take as established the notion that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is a universal right that should be paid to everybody, irrespective of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are overwhelmed by more important reasons that argue that we should apply social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are memories of the ‘poor laws’ and of the unnecessary, extreme and hard-hearted discretion that needlessly withdrew the dignity of the recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance, much of which was in kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary to behave in such a way that dignity is withdrawn if <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is applied to need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are compelling reasons why we must adopt a needs approach and direct our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all kinds to those who need the succour of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happens that at the moment I am discussing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot afford to ignore the areas of health, education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we ought to look very carefully at these transfer payments areas and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area- I am using the word ‘<span class="highlight">welfare</span>’ in its widest sense- to see where we can cut them without hurting the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it sensible that the people who occupy <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing are not among the needy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was Professor Henderson who pointed out that the majority of those in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing were not the poor and that the majority of the poor were not in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its failure after more than two years to come to grips with what is fundamentally wrong in the economy is the reason why so much else is  wrong in  the areas of employment, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, health, migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, farm industry, mining, manufacturing, the motor industry, and Aboriginal programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Provisions exist for the entry of persons for retirement purposes but it is a firm requirement that they should be selfsupporting without recourse to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without consulting the land rights body in Western Australia and without consulting the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning, the Western Australian Government intends to hand over to the Minister for Health and Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> the absolute control of entry by diamond prospectors, including the De Beer group from South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health and Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> would be one of the most racist people in any government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also has significantly improved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In visiting various offices of the DSS, the Inquiry noted that the standard of accommodation provided for the delivery of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services is, in general, second rate in comparison with accommodation occupied by organisations such as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Inquiry finds that the standard accommodation which greets DSS clients is depressing and believes that persons seeking <span class="highlight">welfare</span> support should be provided with facilities equal to those provided by private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater public demand for expenditure in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> state, coupled with more demands for lower taxation- in other words, spend more but give me more- is not the way of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I announced on 2 March, the Commission is to be wound up and  Dr Sax  is to head the new Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Secretariat which will have responsibilities ranging over the wide field of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am therefore pleased that  Dr Sax  has been transferred to head the new Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Secretariat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe very strongly that there is an overlap between the fields of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can often push costs away from health but all we are doing is pushing them on to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He tried to say that this Government had no interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people in Queensland and to suggest that the Government had taken no part in the action that was brought by the people of Aurukun to challenge the exercise of the position of trustee by the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Leichhardt put the matter into perspective when he discussed the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people involved and the need for them to be consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will miss his presence in this Parliament for, as an honourable gentleman and a man interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of his fellow Australians, he was certainly without peer in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New  initiatives  will be undertaken concerning Aboriginal health, alcohol abuse and juvenile <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and the Government looks forward to the fullest consultation with the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development on these and all other issues affecting Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of its attitude of arbitrarily taking from one section to hand to another section it created a void in the economy with the consequence that it did not have the capacity to carry the extensive and lavish social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we are able to hold our heads high and to show very clearly that we can sustain at least the levels of those essential social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which are indispensable in this period of high costs and at this time of uncertainty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This decision does not mean, of course, any diminution in the Government’s interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those who made sacrifices in the defence of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If only the community bodies in this great country, the small businessmen, mayors and chairmen in our cities and towns, Aboriginals, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bodies, and so on- the little people- could galvanise such a response from the Prime Minister with one simple uncomplicated letter, as IBM cares to describe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those particular people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ten years ago, in 1967, the amount outlaid for social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was about 17 per cent of a Budget of about $6 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments exceed 27 per cent of the Budget outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is very easy for the electorate to take the view that in matters of health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, for example, governments should be prepared to spend whatever is necessary, it is extraordinary that when we start to debate matters of defence, suddenly we hear the cry from the Opposition: ‘What is the Government doing about it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriations for defence represented 8.8 per cent of Government outlays, education represented 8.9 per cent, health represented 10.6 percent and social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- wait for it- 27.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are moving now to things such as community health centre committees and the various community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations which have an interest in a particular kind of disability and an interest in setting up a service for persons with particular diseases and handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are currently reviewing the whole health insurance system to see whether there are other ways to ensure that the rate of acceleration of health cost in this country does not crowd out our capacity to spend essential resources on other important areas in the economy such as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, the need for job creation, the need to assist industry to employ people and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be envisaged in the broader context of knowledge and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in which information is regarded as a fundamental resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the States, education, health and community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments, for example, provide services to Aboriginal communities in the same way as they do to other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we be expected to trust the Government on its record in regard to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were forced to introduce it as a response to the unreasonable and totally unacceptable racially discriminatory laws in regard to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Prime Minister was giving those assurances his representative in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  was going about the community conveying the impression that he was an unyielding, dedicated defender of the rights of the Aboriginal people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is totally unacceptable that we have a government presenting itself to the Aboriginal people of Australia and suggesting that so much of this legislation should be taken on trust when its record, insofar as matters of trust are concerned, in regard to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is so appalling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government in its policies on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has established a nasty racist record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in the area of expenditure it has slashed by about $60m in real terms the amount of money being provided very broadly for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> this year compared with the provision in our last Budget in 197S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cut back expenditure in health, education, housing, generally in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, and in all of those areas in which it is well established that Aboriginal people have distinct disadvantages, not through their own fault but because of generations of neglect which has been imposed upon them by the dominant white culture of this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has asked the Opposition for bipartisan support in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want him to step up to those which we expect should be applied for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this debate has proceeded over the past few weeks, I have become increasingly concerned that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people who are caught up in the middle of the wrangle that is going on between the Commonwealth and the State- that is, the Aborigines- is in some danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aborigines is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aborigines is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those seven decades governments, State and Federal, took little interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are just trying to present some public relations per se for the benefit of this benevolent Prime Minister who is suddenly seeking to appear to be concerned about Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under those regulations it is possible for the Minister- in this case the State Minister for Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>- to amend regulations of the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act to allow for all classes of people to go on to reserves with or without the consent of the local Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that State and Territory child <span class="highlight">welfare</span> authorities have stated that 1 96 of the children in question have now been adopted and the adoption of the majority of the remaining children is pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view- I have to admit that I do not have a degree in biology, but I have a great interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of my electorate- the present regeneration of our native forests is being very well managed, especially in the area of wildlife and some of the areas mentioned in the report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is important that these mills do continue in existence and do remain viable operations because the whole <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and, indeed, the economy of quite a section of that part of the State depends upon the continuing operations of the New South Wales sugar industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at what has happened over that period of 10 years, there was an extraordinary increase from 1 7 per cent to over 27 per cent in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure, health expenditure almost doubled, and education expenditure trebled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mi HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition) (2.15)- The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  is an agreeable man- so agreeable, in fact, that he is able to agree at the same time to two conflicting policies on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, publicly, he pretends to support Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which are of the same nature as those which the Aboriginal movement presents and on the other, privately, he enters into sleazy, secret deals with the Queensland Government, allowing the Government of that State to maintain raciallybased policies on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations has reported scathingly about the racist attitudes permeating the Queensland Government’s Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to point out that the whole administration of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in Queensland by that State Government is infected with these racist overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These thoroughly unacceptable and outmoded racist principles have been enshrined in the legislation and policies on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The penalty it is going to pay arises because it is not prepared to stick to the elaborate fiction that the Minister likes to broadcast that we have a government concerned about Aboriginal rights and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do, however, assert that some of the schemes which have been practised, and are the subject of this Bill, are clearly at odds with the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not interested in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the working people of Australia or in sound Budget planning or in the interests of the aged, the young, the business people, the people who make the money so that we as a government can afford the programs we are trying to implement as regards greater social justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill, together with the related Bills which are being introduced today, is a further earnest of the Government’s determination that the development of uranium mining in Australia will be carefully controlled and proceed in a responsible manner with full regard to the need for the protection of the environment and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one guarantee that I can give the House and the nation and that is that the Government will not sit idly by and watch the mounting health bill in Australia consume our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar to the extent that it has done over the last six years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable gentleman that the Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee does not know what the Government is going to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I call upon those persons who are running this Croatian Embassy to realise that they have now gone as far as they can go with their public display, that the game is over and that they should peaceably and sensibly close their Embassy and continue to go about their business of assisting, if they wish, the Australian Croatian community by the ordinary activities and ordinary means by which they look after the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the problems of their members in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I make it perfectly plain once again that the Croatian community in Australia is amongst the finest of the communities that have contributed to our national <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we call upon the specific persons running this Embassy to take heed of Australia’s obligations, to close its activities and to allow members of the Croatian community in this country to continue to develop and contribute to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was with these humanitarian problems in mind that I announced on 22 March that a shipment of canned meat that had already been sent to Lebanon for special <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs was being diverted to emergency programs established by the Lebanese Government to feed people who had fled from southern Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One could reasonably expect in these circumstances some transfer of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> costs back to the public as a direct responsibility, as this Government is now doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also a reduction in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions will throw an added cost burden back onto the average wage earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It appears to me by the way in which Government supporters have sought to absent themselves from the chamber today in this debate in such obvious, organised large numbers that they either do not understand the serious and disturbing implications of reduced export income on the Australian economy and the very worrying effects it will have on business and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people or- I believe this is the more likely explanation- they find themselves totally ill-equipped to present a defence to the way in which they are handling the economy in the light of this development, reinforcing the general decline in the level of economic activity in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) ( 1 1.30)- It is a sad state of affairs when an important mining Bill such as this is brought on for debate in this House at this hour of the night, particularly when one considers that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation depends to a large degree upon the successful development and extraction of our minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More specifically, as Minister for Social Security, he initiated massive increases in health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure which the nation could illafford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972-73, expenditure on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> was $2.88 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of more significance, expenditure on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, as a share of total government expenditure, expanded from 28.3 per cent in 1972-73 to 36.7 per cent by 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill with real pleasure because I believe that the enactment of this legislation will add another form of government action which will reflect the real concern of this Government for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of active small business people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that meeting, was there a frank and forceful exchange of views and should this meeting lead to a more humane understanding of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and, indeed, the future of the workers at Derwent Park? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General in his Speech when opening the Parliament this year mentioned that the Government would be proceeding with the development and export of Australia’s uranium resources in a carefully regulated and responsible fashion with full regard for the population, environmental control and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me to be reasonable to expect an honourable gentleman, so critical of his own Government, so mindful of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the safety of his own people, to point out that these industries have been developed to a great degree by potential adversary governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further widening of access to the concession would raise issues of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy and, in so doing, prompt the question whether the sales tax law is the proper channel for providing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An important issue is therefore whether this far reaching change in established policy would adversely affect the ready deployment of the Defence Force or the morale and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Service families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no greater threat to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the aged than that the aged are part of a population which is at zero rate of growth or less than zero rate of growth, because their own benefits inevitably will be reduced under those circumstances, as has occurred in every country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Perth and I are concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australian people and a new sense of dynamism - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am thinking of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, the health areas and goodness knows what other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some considerations must be borne in mind: For example, the development of the uranium industry in the Northern Territory and the need for the Government to be concerned about the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the workers in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been pointed out to me that when it comes to the implementation of programs to fund community health centres, Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and the like, the Labor Government had full consultation with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enormity of this haemorrhage of national funds can be understood when one considers that in the last Budget a total of only $390m was made available to the States for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing which funds State housing commissions and terminating building societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has one of the highest nursing home bed to population ratios in the world and the domiciliary nursing care program is probably one of the best social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives that the Government is pursuing to try to deinstitutionalise the care of aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should look also at the question of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us see what people who are involved very closely with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the aspirations of the people of these two communities say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Constitution makes specific provisions for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and benefit of Aboriginals to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth there are many matters of a constitutional nature which have not been determined and there are many aspects of this matter which, if pursued to the final point of confrontation, would end with us in litigation in the High Court of Australia from which there would be no solution and no worthwhile result for the Aboriginal people involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some who see the objective as not one of self-management, of the ability of people to make decisions for their own benefit and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, but rather of land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clearly related to the quality of services that the community wants to see provided by governments; in other words the standards of community health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could be argued that those countries within the OECD group that have higher percentages of their gross domestic product absorbed in taxation very often have higher standards of community and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What they did was shift the burden of community and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services in this community from the people who can damned well afford to pay for them to the backs of the people who cannot, to the people who need and ought to live in a community which is able to provide the full range and quality of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All members of this Parliament will be fully aware of my longstanding concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of East Timor, not merely because of Australia’s debt of gratitude to them for their stalwart and loyal support in the dark days of World War II, but because I believe, and all Australians believe, in the sanctity of basic human rights, including self-determination and, of course, all of us would be concerned about the threat to Australia’s integrity and national security posed by the continuation of major military action involving all forms of conventional warfare in an area that is less than half an hour flying time from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe also that the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development should give us the right under clause 15 to debate this issue every year so that we can illustrate the shortcomings that exist in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s priority in respect of all government spending and all public sector spending has been one of cutting back and the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is no exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you like to go back even further and look at the relevant figures when this Administration was previously in office, in 1970-71 some $142m was made available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and that was then 1.74 per cent of government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am trying to bring out the fact that this Government has downgraded its contribution to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing as a proportion of public spending even though public spending overall has been cut by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am moved to suggest that the honourable member was giving a diatribe, not on the Schedule but on some strange philosophical attitude that he has to the issue of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point of this legislation which the Opposition has refused to acknowledge, and which during the course of this debate, it has consistently contested, is that the legislation introduced by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  in this session provides for the most flexible, the most logical and the most innovative approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing that this Parliament has ever seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last December the Government put to the people in its policy speech the undertaking that it would negotiate a new <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing agreement with State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think his remarks can be summarised in this way: A great deal more money should be spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all else, interest rates made it so extraordinarily difficult for people on lower incomesthat is, the people who find support through <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs- to meet the demands made by housing authorities for interest and capital repayments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Government, and I am pleased to support this legislation because once again it gets us back on the path by which more and more people will have access to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs on just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many anomalies in the present <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the people who were the beneficiaries of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs have in some instances been in a position to make repayments in excess of that required by existing contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember the remarks made by the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty regarding the approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Commission’s report made it abundantly clear- as did the report on housing of the Priorities Review Staff- that there were a great many instances of people in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to this Bill the Opposition is saying that State housing authorities apparently cannot be trusted to execute satisfactory, meaningful and efficient <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because they can be trusted that provision has been made for very considerable flexibility to be given to State housing authorities in the approach they will take to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who, other than a socialist, would take the attitude that all decisions regarding <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs should be made in Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who else would take the attitude that there should be no flexibility between States or within States on how <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing funds can best be utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government takes the view, and will not swerve from it, that present circumstances require the most efficient use of funds and the most innovative approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing that can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my friend has said, the Victorian approach to home ownership in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing leads the States without exception and has done so for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is the most far reaching reform in the approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing that this country has seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The care of the aged involves providing a wide range of accommodation and ensuring integration with health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certain local government areas in Australia dc provide housing and we now have a situation where voluntary <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bodies can participate in the allocation of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose we must wait until Budget time to find out just how much further the States will be squeezed in this area that the Government chooses to call <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the young couple is on a wage at about $165 a week, the situation would be that the take-home pay would be $125 a week of which $45 would go to so-called <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, leaving them with a miserable $80 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Interest paid on money lent to purchasers for the purchase of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing will increase by half of one per cent a year until it reaches one per cent below the long term bond rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us bring some common sense, some ordinary commercial nous to the business of supplying houses for people and forget such terms- I hope I am not offending anybody when I say this- as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and things like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points out that, since about 20 per cent of our community are currently ‘migrants’, a similar proportion of the Commonwealth’s general expenditure on education, health, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and other areas should be for the benefit of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware of the current Commonwealth programs and services directed specifically to migrants, covering migrant education, migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, interpreting and translation and other programs and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Review found that the main areas of need -such as for fluency in English and for better communication and information- are common to virtually all areas such as health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, employment and the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They concluded that the ethnic communities themselves and the voluntary agencies can meet the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of migrants more effectively than government agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will also be an increase in the numbers of ethnic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers through an extension of the grant-in-aid scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will introduce a special program to provide ‘once only’ grants of up to $5,000 to assist voluntary groups to introduce new approaches to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service delivery or to restructure existing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and cultural activities of the nongovernment sector have grown considerably in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the trends: Commonwealth expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs has increased from less than 1 7 per cent of the total outlay in 1 967-68 to more than 27 per cent today, 10 years later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our people, and the rights and well-being of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the Commonwealth Parliament has insufficient legislative power to make proper provision for the protection of the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community as a whole from dangers which can arise from the use of radioactive materials and isotopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting that to one side, at least we could agree that if uranium is to be mined the best possible codes governing the safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of workers in the industry ought to be produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Act details provision to be made in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and housing, premises open to the public, university and school buildings, to ensure the representation of the disabled in a wide range of activities, and it covers special cases of deaf, blind and autistic persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s policy is one of carefully regulated and controlled development having full regard to the protection of the environment and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of those resources, while serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people, and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I present the Second Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health entitled ‘Consultative Arrangements and the Co-ordination of Social Policy Development’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  tabled the First Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health on 17 February 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This second and last report of the Task Force covers those terms of reference not reported on in the First Report and makes recommendations in these major areas: Firstly, it recommends a new approach to consultative arrangements across the fields of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development involving the establishment of a new national consultative council; secondly, better co-ordination of social policy development through a small social policy unit for a separate department under a senior Minister and a Cabinet committee with a supporting officials committee; and finally, the need for a review of co-ordination of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development services in the mainland Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 December 1977 the Prime Minister announced that a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy secretariat would be established and that it would work through a Committee of Permanent Heads to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Committee of Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided that the new Secretariat should be responsible, through the Permanent Heads Committee to the Cabinet Committee, for follow-up, as necessary, of any outstanding matters on the First Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the current moves towards selfgovernment in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and the key involvement of the two Territory Legislative Assemblies, the Government will draw to the attention of the two Assemblies the Second Report’s recommendation on the need to review coordination of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>-health services in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were broadcasters, actors, writers, film makers, producers, trade unions, representatives of home and school associations, co-operatives, advertisers, churches, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and voluntary groups, students- but all members of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that apart from conducting that review we should ask the new social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy secretariat, under  Dr Sax,  as its first and most urgent job as part of an overall review of income security, to look at this great gap which exists in our income security net for all self-employed people and, particularly in this case, for farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those areas referred to the whole of the social infrastructurethe need to build up education, health services, urban and regional development, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  is endeavouring foist onto the States responsibility for his policy of reducing government expenditure in various fields of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, many of the specific purpose grants in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> merely made the States the disbursing agents for areas of activity in which the States have long had an interest, or which resulted from State requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to package and compartment the population of the Northern Territory into Aborigines and non-Aborigines and to say that these are the health, education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, transport and other services for Aboriginal people, and those are the services for nonAboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been interested in listening to the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  having spent many many days with him in the Northern Territory, probably in some 30 to 40 visits to the Northern Territory over the years as members of committees associated with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other of the Senate Committee’s recommendations dealing with follow-up <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work, English language training, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, family reunion, et cetera, are being carried out under the supervision of the Standing Committee, and the Determination of Refugee Status Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the new arrangements there will be important roles for all people within the community who have the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of migrants at heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware of the Government’s determination to bring about a greater coordination of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This determination was illustrated by the recent appointment of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Committee of Ministers and its supporting Permanent Heads Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Committees have been established to ensure the integrated development of plans and policies and to review existing policies and programs in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy secretariat will be physically located in the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will have responsibilities ranging over the whole field of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and will in fact absorb some of the ongoing activities of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me summarise by saying that  Dr Sidney  Sax and his secretariat will cover the whole range of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health programs, with a far-ranging brief that will support the planning and programming activities of many departments, but primarily, of course, those of the Department of Social Security and those of my own Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the mining companies to launch the massive public relations campaign that they have is not only dishonest but also must be treated by this Parliament and by the people of Australia as indicating that their major concern is not the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people and the interests of the Northern Territory, and least of all their concern for the traditional Aboriginal occupants of the Territory, but their main concern in this situation is to make profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I thank the honourable member for asking the question and acknowledge his continuing interest in ASCO- in fact, in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Services as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are talking about the relationship between health and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because we know that ill health is one of the main contributing factors to persons finishing up on invalid pensions and on other kinds of pensions and benefits, including unemployment benefits and special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, that excuse which some honourable members seem to wish to offer for the Minister neglects utterly the widespread and cogent criticisms directed at his announcements of 24 May 1978, criticisms not made simply from the Opposition but from the Australian Medical Association, the private health insurers and many social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By going back to a $ 1 for a $ 1 basis, which applied prior to 1973, we have done one other thing, that is, we have lifted the freeze on the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that we have opened up the possibility for all these organisations with outstanding applications, and possibly some others as well, to employ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and home care officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Opposition was in government it froze the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge its members to say which they believe is more equitable: To continue the freeze on a $2 for $ 1 basis with, as the honourable member for Prospect made the point, the 1 12 <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers already employed being placed perhaps in the more fortunate middle class type local government areas and not in any of the other 67 areas to be serviced, or to give everybody who is prepared to do something in the provision of these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and who believes that they are necessary the chance to take advantage of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to cut its contribution towards home-help services and the salaries of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers employed by local councils would not save money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson accused the Government of leading local councils ‘up the garden path’ by offering subsidies for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> schemes and then not continuing to pay for them once they were operating . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Local government is going to stop providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services because it has become fed up being left holding the baby’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have to say that we are a country which, particularly in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, has developed highly complicated and complex structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we know that in this specific area, the co-ordination of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, it is very difficult, for example, to define a homeless population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister explained to Parliament that ‘the Government is in favour of making the Act more effective in meeting the needs of a wider range of homeless people (but) has not yet reached a decision on the proposals of the Task Force on co-ordination in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health, one of which is that is that the homeless persons assistance program should become part of a wider ‘sheltered accommodation program’, administration of which might be devolved to the State governments’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a 57 per cent increase in the coming year for subsidies for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the honourable gentleman that, as I recall it, the Council on the Aging was not too happy when the Labor Government froze the funds available for subsidies to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report on the survey conducted recently by the Department of Social Security- I refer to the booklet entitled ‘A Place of Dignity’ which is the report on a survey of homeless people and homeless persons assistance centres- opened with the comment that an estimated 10,000 homeless men and women in Australia were being assisted by <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is something that the capital city councils cold have a good look at, not necessarily with a view to administering the programs but with a view to encouraging local charitable organisations under their jurisdiction to involve themselves in this area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to social contact there was a high usage of church or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> shelters and a virtual absence of family ties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the community, through its elected representatives, should accept that governments must pursue <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies directed towards areas of real need, such as homeless persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems ridiculous to me that governments should succumb to the political temptation to adopt concepts of universal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits for egalitarian reasons rather than to use selectivity as the proper basis for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ‘needs’ approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is supported by the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty in Australia, and the Government has indicated its support of this concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed, of course, is the courage of government to implement this concept in all of its <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is committed by its own platform to administering <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs in a decentralised, dignified, unobtrusive and sympathetic manner rather than through impersonal bureaucratic agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government must ensure that they are not forced to leave this area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the purpose of these centres also is to provide some scope for rehabilitation rather than just mounting a salvaging operation, additional suitably trained staff, quite apart from <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, may be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons I was surprised when the subsidy arrangements were changed with respect to home care services and the salaries of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, when the full story came out, we realised on a closer inspection of both these areas that it is clear that the financial commitment of this Government will increase substantially- by 14 per cent with regard to home care services and by 57 per cent with regard to subsidies for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also point out to those honourable members who seem to think that the Government should stay in every area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> for all time that the very title of this Bill is the States Grants (Home Care) Amendment Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They covered rent, furnishing and equipment, with subsidies for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> staff members and a subsidised meal allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, only a small amount of money has been set aside for expenditure in this area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to depend for their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> on charity from organisations such as the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army, the Uniting Church in Australia and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance should be above politics, if possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment to section 10 of the Act reduces the amount of money payable to the States for the salary of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer of a senior citizens centre from two-thirds to one-half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Welfare</span> officers employed by local government under these grants play an important role in preventive medicine by assisting the elderly to remain socially active and in touch with community health facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No new grants have been given in the time of the Fraser Government and the present cuts mean that local government bodies will have to find several hundred thousand dollars, sack their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers or put up their rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want increased technology to advance the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the whole of the country, but we have to plan for its introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time our task would be very much easier if we could be sure that there was a degree of cooperation from the State government which should have some interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Budget also engages in the dangerous tactics of cutting expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and pennypinching in its expenditure on socially disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s mentality and priority in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing demonstrate clearly that it has set out not only to create great problems within the housing sector but also to aggravate severely the enormous suffering and social problems within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its attack is so brutal that it can be understood only by examining the amount of expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing as a percentage of all Government outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1974-75 Budget $385m was spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, or 2.16 per cent of Government outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year, $330m will be spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, representing 1.1 per cent of Government outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those countries seem to be moving as fast as they can towards the development of nuclear industries and they do not seem to be very concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their citizens during that process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cuts, the tax changes and the Government expenditure cuts all have as a basic element a redistribution of income from those who are not well off to those who are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for Social Security is most concerned about the overpayment of benefits to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year in New South Wales there has been a reduction of $33m in the allocation to that State for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, a valuable and desirable contribution could be made to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, $100m ought to be provided by the Government for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  and in speeches made by the Minister, the Government has stated that in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing the amount of money made available this year is equivalent to the amount made available last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Nearly 100,000 families are waiting for homes from the Housing Commission and at least half a million people are living in sub-standard housing, and this Government has not only increased the social problems of those elements in the community which need housing and reneged with regard to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, but it has also reneged on the home savings grant scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new agreement is ordered to allow the States a greater capacity, as homes are turned over and sold, to reinvest in their own right for the provision of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me comment on one particular category of Budget expenditure, namely, social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, despite the cries that we have heard about cutbacks in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure, it must be pointed out that this area of the Budget has been the subject of a 7 per cent increase in expenditure in this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget proves that the Government is concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the oil companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Utah. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of multinational automobile companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what does it care about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of low income families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does it care about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the unemployed youth suffering a reduction in the value of his social service benefits through this Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which is long overdue, which the Australian Labor Party never even thought of doing but which this Government has done as a result of its consideration for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health of people who live in areas such as that which the honourable member for Riverina represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, with a slightly more relaxed Budget in 1980- relaxed in terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisionsthe Liberal Government will go to the polls at the end of that year hoping that the false start in the economic recovery and a little more money in the pockets of the poor, before the added availability of funds induces a rise in inflation, may fool many people in the community to vote again for the Liberals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for those who need social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, it is interesting to note that the Budget provides $8 billion to help the family, the handicapped and the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be quite wrong if I did not say that I was deeply impressed with the work of the principal of the High School,  Mr Ronald  Knox, and his staff, particularly the Aboriginal teaching aides, and the sisters and nurses from the Queensland Government who work in the hospital as well as those in charge of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government leaders are constantly stating that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should be based on need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continued adherence to universal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments is bad <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government should have taken the opportunity in this Budget at last to adopt selectivity based on need as the basis of expenditure on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which at present costs taxpayers in excess of $8 billion per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, the ability of governments to move constantly towards lower taxes is limited by universal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, of course, if governments did decide to base <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments solely on need there would be the opportunity for governments to introduce tough budgets such as this one without, at the same time, being forced to implement penny-pinching measures involving social injustices such as reverting to annual adjustments of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Minister for Special Trade Representations  (Mr Garland),  who is at the table, will convey my suggestions to the Government on this particular philosophy of disbursing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in all these areas I think all the members of this Parliament should recognise that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments should be based solely on need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As evidence of its all-pervasive cruelty, the Government has imposed on these people new and regressive taxes, crippling new charges on lump sum leave payments, the abolition of the maternity allowance, the destruction of the concept of universal health and massive reductions in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very mean measure which will have serious consequences for some of the most disadvantaged recipients of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> published a report entitled ‘Drug Problems in Australia- An Intoxicated Society?’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I refer again to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> entitled ‘Drug Problems in Australia- an intoxicated society?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot find too much evidence of the Government’s good intentions and we may well ask this question: Is it good intentions which prompted the Government’s decision to tax social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiaries such as accident victims who are being rehabilitated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the very simple things to which aged people who are the recipients of these programs and whose <span class="highlight">welfare</span> will be affected by the implementation of this clause can relate and they are the things they cannot understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing the State governments act with responsibility within the framework of the federalism policy there is no reason to believe that there will be any reduction in the level of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer and home care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about $5m in the one instance and a considerably lesser sum in the other instance, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for direct matching grants for the States for a range of home care services and for the salaries of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers employed at or in association with senior citizen centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act broadly provides three forms of assistance: One, the home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance to aged persons in their own homes; two, the building and equipping of senior citizen centres; and three, the employment of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers by or in association with senior citizen centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intensely political nature of the lobby and political groups concerned about old people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is one of the things that strikes the politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the whole philosophy of our approach to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the security of human beings is under discussion here today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is nonsensical that people can make millions of dollars and remit them overseas and then make a very small contribution to this country’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In some areas of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Queensland lags. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the disastrous effects of continuous changes in policies and depression of government action is the impact that has upon the professional people who have committed themselves to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States for approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer and home care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers’ salaries were concerned, $900,000 was allocated in 1977-78 and $ 1.1m was allocated in 1978-79. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that when the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  was speaking to this measure he mentioned that the Government was now in a position to lift the embargo on approvals of new <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer positions in home care services which has been in force since October 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the run-up to the last Budget we were informed in no uncertain terms that the business community of this country wanted drastic cuts made in social security payments, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that this is one of those difficult areas in relation to taxation and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the honourable gentleman, secondly, that if indeed the community believes that some amongst its number, by reason of their disabilities, should be deserving of additional assistance, the right method of doing that is by direct support and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last 33 months the Government has presided over the deliberate erosion of financial support for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and development programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During these months before the more active and official negotiations commenced a series of documents on environmental, conservation and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> matters was prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the very substantial increase in the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which could be derived from development of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides data for economic and social planning and for assessing the need for and the impact of housing, education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and taxation policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A vocal spokesman in America recently said: ‘In America we tax work, growth, investment, employment, savings and productivity, while subsidising non-work, consumption, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and debt.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still far too many <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs which involve transfers of tax from poor people to rich people and these are many of the areas in which the Labor Party seems to be standing up in support of well-off people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer payments through the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system should be directed entirely to people in need and an enormous proportion of them are still not being so directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funding for the Melbourne resource centre which is run by the Australian-Greek <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society has been provided only up to 3 1 January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one ought to recognise that for 23 years there was a Liberal Party government in this country which certainly did not talk about multi-culturalism, which certainly did not introduce programs on migrant education, which certainly did not support centres like the Ecumenical Migration Centre or the Migrants Clearing House and which left voluntary agencies with limited resources to fight alone in the whole field of migration <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, having said that, one ought to recognise that migrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cannot be separated from the whole question of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can inform the honourable gentleman that the Government has decided not to proceed with the taxation of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments enumerated on page 22 of the Budget Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country depends very, very significantly, for its internal security and its economic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> on international trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers of the Department of Social Security and of the Commonwealth Employment Service also deserve considerable credit for their understanding of the situation and the fact that they were able to operate within the changes made to various parts of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> legislation, which for the first time enabled selfemployed persons to benefit in times of stress from the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net incomes of people in other sectors of the community, whether they be doctors, people in industry or social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, are higher than those of the farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Severe cutbacks in areas vital to the realisation of equal opportunity- education, child care, retraining, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, legal aid, et ceterahave been the order of the day under the Fraser administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been able to give more money to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the increased allocation in the Budget for expenditure under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, all outstanding applications by State governments for new <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer positions and new home care services could be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also will need increased money to pay for the city’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She said that the cutbacks would mean that councils would have to raise rates to maintain the quality of existing services and that the Federal Government was paying lip service to the needs of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> while taking money away from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the Government’s policies is Australia’s belief that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the inhabitants of the Islands is paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the States Grants (Home Care) Act, the Commonwealth pays a subsidy to the States of up to half the salary of approved <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers who are employed at, or in conjunction with, senior citizens’ centres and who are employed wholly or mainly in providing a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service to aged persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Commonwealth subsidises a total of 1 12 <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer positions throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since October 1975 financial constraints have precluded the approval of new <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer positions for subsidy under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With additional funding provided in the 1978-79 Budget I was recently able to announce that the Commonwealth support could be extended to an additional 79 <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers bringing the total to 1 9 1 positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Galbally Report regarding the appointment of ethnic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers to work specifically among the ethnicaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has appropriated $0.1 lm for the salaries of 1 0 new ethnic <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer positions in 1 978-79; to be followed by five positions in 1 979-80 and 1 980-8 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some local government authorities in Victoria have been under a misapprehension that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers whom they employ in accordance with the Act must devote their full time to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of aged persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The flexible use of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer staff is possible and no change to the guidelines used by my Department is seen to be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The report also identifies potential improvements with communications associated with defence, transport, health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the subject of meeting community needs, the Task Force also highlights the possible value to isolated communities in health care, education and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> from improved communications which could be facilitated by satellite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Minister made other points in relation to the sorts of services which can be contributed to the community in health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and a range of other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is highly fortuitous that he has come into this portfolio to administer a matter which is very important to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of ex-servicemen and indeed servicemen who, as a result of initiatives taken by the Labor Government referred to by the honourable member for Reid, are also eligible for assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a citizen of the oldest State of the Commonwealth of Australia, I make it quite clear that I am gravely concerned about the future economic and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the State governments’ public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is concerned, nearly 100,000 families are on the housing commission lists, waiting for homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me illustrate in more detail the Draconian cuts that this Government has inflicted on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs of the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Agreement gives the States more flexibility to direct <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funding to those in real need and to those who can best use those funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to recognise that we are dealing with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, with public housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem with previous agreements, and in particular the agreement which existed between 1973 and 1974 and which was supported by the then Labor Administration, was that a significant proportion of money available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing went to people who did not need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A substantial amount of additional money over and above the base amount provided by the Commonwealth is available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Australia in the current financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there is clearly an opportunity for the States, if they so desire, to increase the funds flowing to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional State funded programs in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing amounted to $60m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have an opportunity to provide at least the same level of activity in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing in the current financial year as they provided in the last financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite wrong of the Opposition to paint deliberately a false picture of the very real support that is being provided by this Government for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the funds available should at least equal those provided by the Commonwealth last year, so long as the States play their part and co-operate in providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Minister is a weak Minister and the result is the situation which we have in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we have the Shelter organisation in New South Wales talking about what is a vast and overwhelming need for emergency accommodation, 100,000 people around the country are on waiting lists and the Minister is attempting to defend what is a massive reduction in funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He speaks about the recent Commonwealth-States housing finance agreement as representing some kind of progress in a sense that it will now be possible under the agreement to remove- from housing commission accommodation people who he says are well over and who I would say usually are marginally over the criteria that have traditionally been provided in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner that he can be removed from the Ministry, the sooner the people in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and public housing will get a reasonable deal in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ill-behoves any member of the Opposition to take out figures in isolation and to say that, because fewer dollars were made available in this particular year, the total funding for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing is less than it was in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that legislation we find that the States, as co-operators in federalism and as sovereign States in their own right, are to contribute in certain circumstances on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Reid takes time off to do his mathematics and adds up the figures, he will find that money is being made available in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing area for those people who are in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should explain that the Service pension is a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment, broadly equivalent to the age pension under social services legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The care of the sick and the aged, and the protection of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the needy in the community, is becoming a difficult and extremely complex task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I plead once again with people who, for one reason or another, are deriving social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits unlawfully, to think carefully of those elderly people who are living in what could only be termed shocking conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to the creation of a society which offers equality of opportunity, security and assistance to those who suffer from special disabilities … we want to create a system of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and benefits which is not class tainted and whose provisions are not stigmatised as charitable concessions to the deserving poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I must confess to some difficulties in understanding what the basic aims and goals of the present Government are in the fields of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health, and related areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of this Government during a period of nowprolonged recession portrays an incredible insensitivity to the social consequences of Government economic decisions and has been marked by the beginning of the process of running down <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, which honourable members will remember was the characteristic trait of the Menzies years, of the 23 years of Liberal rule which preceded the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cannot be stressed often enough in this chamber that in 1972 Australia was one of the poorest served countries in the developed world in terms of access to health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development entitled  Public Expenditure Trends,  published in June this year, in the early 1960s Australia was spending 9.6 per cent of its gross domestic product on public <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, compared with the average for OECD countries of 13.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time no other countries, with the exception of Greece and Japan, were spending less on public <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which included health, education and social security expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early 1970s, despite the so-called ‘extravagance’ of the Labor Government, Australia was spending only 12.8 per cent of its GDP on public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditures, compared with an OECD average expenditure of 18.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to comment on general health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies for country people and on some of the things which have been done and on those which remain to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in the broadest terms to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of Federal Government assistance as distinct from commodity or industry policy, that is, assistance which attempts to alleviate the day to day problems encountered by country people to a greater degree or to reduce the cost disadvantage of those country people compared with city people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not aware that general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principles would exclude country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which I believe comes under the heading of social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another tremendous <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problem concerns education in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many problems and disadvantages in this broad aspect of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> remain- I believe that it is tremendously important to talk about broad aspects of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in debates such as this- but I am confident that this Government is the first government since Federation which is genuinely trying to do something for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> problems in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not share his optimism about the Government’s actions in the field of health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They need a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officer to deal with the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> cases in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking to the estimates for health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of social security, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, this socially irresponsible ad hoc decision making is most pronounced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I know, as I think other honourable members know, of particular examples which indicate that some savings can be made in the proper administration of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, where people have been able improperly to receive unemployment benefits, we need to have a system that is capable of catching those people who take advantage of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anybody can logically disagree with that, although the very nature of the way in which we approach these matters demands some sensitivity particularly for the people who are in the unfortunate position of having to need <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will see demographic changes in Australia which will necessitate a much more fundamental review of our <span class="highlight">welfare</span> systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that greater regard has to be had to the needs and the aspirations of those who have to pay the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits- the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they demand that we look responsibly at the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs that we undertake in Australia and set about reaching the needy people as distinct from those who are able to get in on the act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard the honourable member for Batman  (Mr Howe)  tonight arguing about principles in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, equality of opportunity and need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He really did not apply the principles but used them as a basis for arguing for a much wider <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system than the one we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the broad areas we need to come to grips with the total situation of the people who are claiming <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering programs as a Government and as a Parliament we have to look at need not with a broad brush approach adding a little to the lot of everybody who happens to be a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiary but, as has been done in this Budget, we have to be prepared to look much more conscientiously at the needs of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of increasing broadly across the range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, we have to develop specific programs to meet those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is he really concerned about cuts in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs but he did not analyse where there had been cuts in expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government, in its assessment and reexamination of the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, to get a co-ordinated plan to ensure that retention rates for people on low incomes are increased, that the tax system and the social security system are harmonised, that one department is used to administer the test to be applied, and that the heavy burden placed on low income earners is removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note also that there have been backdowns in other significant areas, particularly with regard to the taxation of some social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great difficulties for any government is trying to ensure that the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> allocations go to those in greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies the great difficulty has been to identify in some circumstances those people who require assistance and those who require it more than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In this important discussion of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, I take the opportunity of pointing out to the Committee the very positive advances effected in very difficult times by a very competent Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and by a government that has demonstrated its concern and compassion for the needs and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spoke earlier this evening in the discussion on the estimates for the Department of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned in the general comments that I made in that area the different needs of Aboriginals and the fact that one cannot apply the normal sorts of criteria for determining the way in which <span class="highlight">welfare</span> requirements and community development needs of Aboriginal communities can be accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disappointing to me to have to follow the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  when he merely sees the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aboriginals in terms of the provision of funds and the provision of such funds in greater amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it has any concern for, or knowledge of, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people, or for some of the destructive elements that have caused this unique scheme to be developed in consultation with Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We people who are given by our colleagues in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party shadow ministerial responsibilities in the economic area have few opportunities to follow our interests in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The philosophy of taxation is based on how much incentive a person has to earn income in order to produce the revenue that government- the Labor Government particularly, and this Government proceeds to follow suit- needs to pay for fairly lavish <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and social programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to see the Government moving towards is a resource tax raising $ 150m; to eliminate the crude oil levy windfall gain to the oil development companies of $340m; to impose a capital gains tax on gains in excess of $200,000, raising $300m; to adjust the highest levels of personal income tax to raise $200m; to abolish the investment allowance, $400m; to abolish tax avoidance through family trusts, $100m-$l,490,000 as against the imposition of the direct increases in personal tax and denying pensioners and employment beneficiaries and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiaries of benefits amounting to about $l,140m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I congratulate the Government on dropping everything contained on page 22 of the Budget Speech, which dealt with the proposed taxation of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Queensland Supreme Court on S October 1976 decide that  Mr Killoran  as trustee of an Aboriginal reserve must account for all moneys in respect of mining on that reserve, keep properly audited books and devote the proceeds to the reserve, not to the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-46-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>None of us can treat this matter lightly, because the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and well-being of this nation depend very much on sustaining a strong export performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this ‘grand design of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> reform’- that is placed in inverted commas to indicate the clear sarcasm- comes from the same man, Fraser, the man who promised tax cuts at an election eight months ago and this week introduced substantial tax increases in their place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I well remember and I should imagine that honourable members remember that in about October 1975 the Labor Government froze all outlays for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many people were forced to leave their homes and had no <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing to go to thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of Parliament have to face the tremendous dilemma of choosing between committing themselves to statements that have been made and the matter of directing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must seek as much as possible to direct <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If persons who are not entitled to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and who can well look after themselves are given assistance from the public purse we will find that the whole economic structure will be in peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In general, the Government is expending large sums of money on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and it to be supported for the massive outlays that it has undertaken in very difficult economic times as part of its overall humanitarian program in assisting the underprivileged in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When in due course the pensioners of Australia read  Hansard  they will be interested to learn that during the debate on these social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> Bills tonight three quorums were called by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are talking about an appropriation of $8,0 15m, an increase of $524m on the actual expenditure last year for social security and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which amounted to $7,490m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The numbers on the Labor Party side have increased slightly on this occasion but once again it demonstrates their absolute contempt and their absolute lack of concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the pensioners of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary that a Minister who began her career in the Ministry speaking about the need to fine down bureaucracy has moved to add further and further to that bureaucracy by adding thousands of additional employees and increasing the emphasis on surveillance powers while, doing little to make any contribution towards solving the fundamental problems which are giving rise to an ever-increasing social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need to give all Australians access to adequate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, on the assumption that they contribute to people’s real income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total outlay on social security and general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> items is 27.8 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays, an increase from $7,490.3m last year to $8,0 14.7m this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and economic policy are two subjects which are too often discussed in isolation from each other even though it is common for discussions of either subject to pay lip service to the importance of the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that very often economic policy and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy are perceived as being antagonistic when in fact they are necessarily complementary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a demonstration that the Labor Party believes that the interests of the people lie not in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people but in their organisation of power for their own aggrandisement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 8 stands as pan of that general pattern and that general principle which has been enunciated right throughout the Bill and which limits the existing standards and conditions of those who are receiving social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Bill and the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy provide for an expenditure of $6, 602m this financial year, which is an increase of $399m over that of the previous year- a record expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if one took the most optimistic view of inflation, the reality is that over the course of the next 12 months prices will rise and, as they rise, the standard of living of those people relying on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits will decrease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not one of those who suggest that we should keep a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit simply because it is there and has been there for some time, but I am not compelled to think otherwise by the arguments of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes people on this side of the chamber are presented as being raving radicals who, when they argue for the rights of the unemployed, for example, are somehow taking a position which cannot be defended on rational grounds, a position which is not supported by groups which have status and standing and which represent all the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> interests in Australia, certainly in the voluntary sector and partially in the government sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to quote at some length from a statement issued, after the introduction of the Budget, by the Australian Council of Social Service, a body which represents <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to the remarks of the Liberal Victorian Minister for Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>,  Mr Brian  Dixon, on 30 July last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the approach of my colleagues, who have taken a very proper and legitimate point- a point that I commend to all honourable members in this place- that it ill-behoves this nation at this time to create a separate category for the unemployed in terms of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments because, as has been pointed out, of all the groups in this community the unemployed are in many cases, through no fault of then- own, in quite desperate economic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are serious in saying that they must be assisted to find work it is perfectly proper for unemployment benefit payments to be indexed in the same way as every other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment has been indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate is catalysed by irregular but frequent changes to health financing arrangements by the Commonwealth Government of the time, sometimes for reasons of community health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and sometimes to help balance the books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the opportunity of thanking the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd),  the  Chairman  of the Government members Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee, for his very constructive speech and for the work that his Committee has done in assisting the Government in the formulation of its policy in the health insurance area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill should go a long way to assure responsible members of the Public Service that both this Government and, I think, governments in general are concerned for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and better management of the Commonwealth Public Service and that they are not about putting down their own employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Les  Johnson said:   the vast substantial increase in the national <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which could be derived from development of the Ranger project could not lightly be overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of playing a role in using Australian resources in manufacture, they become part of the pool of unemployed, depending on the support of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason, I was pleased to read the speech given by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  to the Western Austraiian Mining Club on 30 March 1978 when he made the statement that the mining industry has made a significant contribution during the last decade or so to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Broken Hill mines have made a very significant contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia since that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support these remarks because I believe that nothing holds greater promise for the nation ‘s future <span class="highlight">welfare</span> than the development of our mineral resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although government policies for the most part have been responsible for sending large numbers of the population to join dole queues and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> lines, the Government has consistently avoided or denied its responsibility for caring for these people, preferring instead to capitalise on their misfortunes and victimise them by referring to them as dole bludgers or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fat cats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite laws regarding compulsory education and threats from social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies that children who could not be fitted into schools were truants, it was some time before 25 forlorn kids at Enterprise were permitted to go to Springvale South High School, and then the school council had to pay $550 for one term ‘s bus fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Among the problems increasingly referred to are the growing alienation of the young to the community and its institutions, increases in vandalism and more serious forms of anti-social behaviour, loss of incentive and work motivation, increasing incidence of personal psychological problems, pressures on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and the loss of skilled manpower resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ten years ago spending by the Federal Government on health, education and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> used to make up one-quarter of the total Budget outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every school above kindergarten looked as though it would be promoted to a degree conferring institution in order to meet the political requirements of the Victorian Government without any consideration at all of the educational status and standing of the degrees which were conferred or the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the students who were subjected to this type of economic or political expansion of these facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make the point that as far as funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is concerned there will be as much available to the States this year to fund <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing as there was last year, but it depends upon State effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States make the effort and the contribution that I believe they will make, then in no sense will <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing suffer during this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us in this place seem to have the idea that unemployment is an economic problem and that we have to get these kids into the work place so that they can be earning money, paying taxes and alleviating our social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the OECD experience is to be followed- I recommend that it should be followed- what we will need and will see over the next year or so is an increased number of community-based schemes which would have incorporated in them a close affinity with community groups, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, local government, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in this particular industry in the last few months, what we have seen has been an almost co-ordinated approach by members of various unions to sabotage the future <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the entire Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime however, it means that in the field of science, at any rate, we can get the degree of co-operation between nations which is so desirable and for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, a number of Government members- quite a small number- members on the Government parties’ Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee brought this matter to my attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, if one believed that governments should be responsible for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens- all its citizens- and that governments should show the way in job creation programs, in providing health services, education, transport, et cetera, one would agree that this government is a miserable failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the imposition of external pressures on the negotiations, particularly on the Aborigines, by people who were pushing their own barrow and who had no interest whatsoever in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines but only in their own hysterical opposition to uranium mining, I think it certainly says a great deal for all sides that the negotiations were successfully completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If therefore the Government proceeds to act on the basis of an agreement made under duress, by the Northern Land Council or by an arbitrator, without it being subjected to the processes required to develop a consensus, the Government and its partners in the ventures are likely to encounter situations in which individual Aborigines or groups of Aborigines who feel their rights are being infringed will, in all good conscience, act in conflict with the terms of that agreement Such situations can be productive of grievance, hostility, and, potentially, violence and will damage further the already eroded confidence of Aborigines and their friends among white Australians in the Government’s expressed concern for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and undertakings to protect their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that in a year of budgetary restraint there has been an increase of 7 per cent in the total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want now to comment on some of the remarks that have been made from time to time about so-called cutbacks by this Government in the provision of social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is about more unemployment; he is about imposing sacrifices on people; and he is about cutting back on important <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs and neglecting many areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments of this nature must be coupled to a means test of some order so that the people who really need the assistance in fact really get the assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been talk about <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, of people on low incomes, and of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can justify our actions in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area even though we have had to try to constrain public expenditure where possible, and we have been able to strike a healthy balance between meeting the needs of the people and, at the same time, trying to stabilise the economy after the chaotic period when Labor was in office from 1972 to 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should put our principles, we should put the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people in our region ahead of the demands of corporate trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, we are seeing a pronounced deterioration in the relative strength of the United States and its allies visavis the Soviet Union and its allies, a pronounced deterioration in the capacity of the Western alliance to present a united face, and a deterioration in the capacity of the Third World to feel that in the West it has a group of states which are reliable, can be depended upon to make decisions and have the courage to carry them out for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years the greatest pressure has been for increased expenditure in the areas of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice that in the  Oxford English Dictionary  the definition of altruism is ‘devotion to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of others; regard for others, as a principle of action; opposed to egoism or selfishness’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some corporations might very well find that an enormous project involving millions of dollars and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and livelihood of thousands of Australians could be placed in jeopardy because if a breach of section  82KH  or section  82KJ  of the Act were discovered the entire tax deductibility would disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is not the rate of tax but the growing expenditure on health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education with which the Government and the country are faced today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967-68, ten years ago, this Government had a total commitment to health, education and social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of $ 1,571m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, the rate of taxation is not keeping pace with the amount of expenditure in these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967-68 the expenditure on those three items of health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> represented 72 per cent of personal income tax collections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On reading through the report of the Australian Taxation Office and associating it with social security payments and other such expenditures, I found that in 1978-79, of every dollar that the Commonwealth collects in excise, indirect taxation and other sources of revenue, 42c will be spent on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and 23c will go to the States and local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite honourable members who complain about the insufficiency of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> commitments compared with commitments to other government initiatives to look at the fact that if we do not have a healthy economy, if we do not have incentives for taxpayers to get out and earn money productively, we will have no support for the standard of living which we currently enjoycertainly we will have no income from which to make <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to enable recipients of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits to continue to enjoy that standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a rather muted statement but he did say that the Public Service of Canberra is important to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, I arranged for a professional <span class="highlight">welfare</span> person from an outside organisation to approach this centre to request a breakdown of the reasons why women visit the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the most substantial of these amendments concern the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and custody of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill will extend the range of circumstances in which a court can order the parties to confer with a counsellor, or can order a counsellor to report to it, on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These powers will become available to the court in any proceedings in which the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children of a marriage is affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All parties should be concerned about the future health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as soon as this Government came in it decided that of that $18m, $1 1.1m in the 1975-76 Budget was too much for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July of that year he had established the Task Force on Coordination in <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If not, can we forecast possible future  problems for the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also want to ensure that proper provision is made for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and interests of Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region and of all other people living in the region and working on the development projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure, so far as it can, that passports are not issued to persons likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country or the rights and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, these are, with certain exceptions, persons who are not married and who have not reached the age of 18 years, unless the consent of persons having custodial rights has been obtained; persons in respect of whom the authorised officer has reason to believe that there is in force a warrant for arrest issued in Australia; persons whom the authorised officer has reason to believe are required to remain in Australia under a court order, or under a condition of parole or of recognisance, surety or bail bond; persons who owe money to the Commonwealth as a result of circumstances arising from previous overseas travel; persons whom the authorised officer believes already to be in possession or control of an Australian passport in force- unless there are special reasons- and persons in respect of whom the Minister has decided that issue of a passport would threaten security or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion, I wish to assure honourable members that substantial effort has been expended to produce a Bill which provides just and equitable treatment for Australians wishing to travel overseas; which provides the maximum protection for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and convenience of those travellers; which nevertheless pays due regard to our responsibilities toward those countries to which they travel, and which brings passport legislation into line with the modern and liberal philosophies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In common with, I suppose, other honourable members, I rose to take part in the debate in order to give servicemen an assurance that this House and the Parliament are concerned about their <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that everyone in the House has listened very carefully to, and is in agreement with, the sentiments expressed by my friend the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  and others about the concern of honourable members on both sides of this House for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and well-being of ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a community we have an obligation to look after, wherever it can be done and needs to be done, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of exservicemen and of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a ruthless, callous, abandonment of interest and responsibility for the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of urban dwellers! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government programs in the health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> fields are actively seeking to assist these persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surplus capital funds remaining after responsibility has been transferred will be distributed to the Army and Air Force central <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds in suitable proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular I would like to mention the current  Chairman  of the Board,  Mr G.  J. Betts, whose advice and experience have been of much assistance to me in arriving at the present result, I would also like to pay tribute to ASCO which has been the source of over $10m for Army and Air Force <span class="highlight">welfare</span> programs since it began trading in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must look to co-operation with the States to ensure the proper use of federal money given to the States for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus we have a series of changes to the PJT, tax laws, controls on mineral exports, protection, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> measures and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant amendments being made by this Bill is the amendment to section 62 of the Act, which deals with conferences and reports by counsellors and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision will be amended so that a conference can be ordered with counsellors or the court can order a report on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of children to the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court can make these orders whenever the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the children to the marriage is affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, it is extremely difficult to get away from that feeling of involvement with both parties, particularly where the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of a child is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child is the most important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that in most of the decisions that have been brought to my attention the judges who have been appointed to this jurisdiction have shown a great degree of objectivity in deciding what is to be done for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, departmental officers are acting under the direct instructions of Government ministers who have made it quite clear that they expect the toughest possible interpretation to be placed on every set of regulations and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me return to the claim that it is the responsibility of members of this Parliament to spend the nation’s revenue for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At what stage will he consider that there is a danger to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim that with 60,000 abortions a year there is already a danger to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation, and the taxpayer who believes that this is so should not be forced to pay for a practice that is destroying the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the principle that in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area those who can afford to pay should do so, and that public funds should be reserved for those in need, and only those in need, I submit is a valid one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the better services provided by the Parramatta City Council- a similar situation applies in almost every other local government area- is a mealsonwheels setup which is of course organised through the old people’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> establishments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the last 12 months the Council has been continuing to exchange correspondence with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  protesting about the fact that the subsidy which has traditionally been paid by the Commonwealth Government towards the salary of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers has been reduced from twothirds to one half, which seems to me to be a fairly penny-pinching sort of operation, anyhow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that there would be a reasonable argument that could be made out to try to coerce the Minister for Health to do something about his sister department, the Department of Social Security, seeing whether some good sense could be brought to bear to ensure that subsidies- as low as they were before with two-thirds of the salary of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers being found by the Government- were restored to a reasonable level and also with a view to seeing that the 50c a day pittance paid to Meals on Wheels was increased to a figure more in line with the actual cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every other citizen is entitled to an age pension, to a family allowance, to unemployment benefit and to the full range of Australian social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits; but that is not the case for those Australian citizens who are unfortunate enough to live on Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The merest concession to the islanders’ <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has been made by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government has the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Norfolk Island in mind, it will accept the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits should be available to the islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This raises the very vexed question of the extension of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions to the island and the concomitant extension of taxation laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, this can be done only if we extend the Australian <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system to the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the fairly elaborate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system which exists in Australia is extended to Norfolk Island, then the unavoidable consequence is that we must also extend to the island the taxation laws which apply on the Australian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again we have a situation on Christmas Island where there are no <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions for residents, except a very unsatisfactory ad hoc arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we find that the Government baulks at the question of the extension of taxation and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions to Norfolk Island, still leaving it with a no-man’s land relationship with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are on the island a group of people who have not accrued those rights in some other country and it is proper that this Parliament and the Government here in Canberra should be concerned about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the security of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if we take the question of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, which the Minister seems to believe is an area which can develop over a number of years, it seems to me that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of Norfolk Island at this time is of major concern to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is another area in which I think we have to assert that Australia as a whole must insist that at least a minimum standard of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> should apply on Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar situation exists in relation to the police, corporate affairs, prices and rent control, industrial safety, mining and minerals, public and private land, environmental protection, child, family and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system is being worked out no doubt the question of those who might temporarily be in need because of unemployment will be considered in the context of that sort of system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all in our capitalist society- it is a system which has proved quite conclusively when one looks around the world that it is the best system for all people- it is tremendously important to keep money within the system so that the producers and the service industries, the productive people, can have that money for investment so that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our people can always be on the increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the results of the elections held in 1975 and 1977 I wonder whether the Australian people want ever-increasing handouts or socalled middle class <span class="highlight">welfare</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or should we not be looking more to a sensible <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy that looks after disadvantaged people or, as referred to in the amendment, the underprivileged; so that we tax the rich to look after those people but not to look after themselves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, about 85 per cent of all personal income tax collected in Australia is spent on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be possible to initiate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> initiatives such as family allowances to a satisfactory level and it will not be possible to index such benefits regularly in order to preserve the real value of those benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This anomalous situation occurs when selectivity based on need is ignored as the basis of disbursing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation where I consider it quite necessary, if we are to preserve equity and indulge in responsible budgetary management at the same time, for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payment to be more closely associated with a needs basis than is presently the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is possible to tackle the big items of health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in a way that will not do anything to disadvantage the needy but in fact will improve their position- by placing means tests on benefits paid to those who are not needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been too much glib talk about what has been described as the escalation of allocations to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been interested to observe the way in which a large number of countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have tended in recent years to move in a similar direction in their social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be very careful when we transfer hidden or disguised social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments that are delivered through a reduction of tax liability that would have been payable but for the concession to a particular category of person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become quite clear that it is very difficult to compare the position of one country with another in terms of percentages of public expenditure as against the gross domestic product when one country pays social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits not only to the needy in the sense that they are poor, but to the needy in the sense that they have dependent children whatever their level of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is finding that it is terribly difficult to compare the position of one country this year with its situation last year because countries are changing the proportions of their social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> packages which they deliver by way of explicit payment as compared with those that they provide through a tax rebate or tax concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is not an adequate realisation that one can achieve the same social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> goals through these alternative means, we sometimes find that governments through their income tax system pursue policies which are contradictory to those that are pursued through their social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suspect that one of the grave problems that confronts many families in Australia is that that very paradox exists in Australia today where, through the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, we are seeking to do one thing and we are undermining the attainment of the goals we are trying to achieve by the sort of tax system that we are operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I presume that when the honourable member for Perth said tonight that he agreed with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments being made to people who were poor, who were in need, then he takes a very narrow definition of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that we have a confused debate about the quantum of resources being spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and equity considerations completely absent, but also no mention is made of the use of the capital market for the purpose of government policy, especially monetary and balance of payments measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering regulations of the market, the committee may overlook the important role of regulation in achieving both social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> goals and the objectives of government measures, particularly those dealing with monetary and balance of payments policies, as I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the question I raise in this debate, particularly as social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and equity considerations have not been explicitly referred to in the terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part of the motion moved this morning deals with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications and housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it demonstrates that the proposer of the motion misunderstands the question when he brings forward social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects of a capital market inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> aspects and housing are political questions which must be determined by the political parties and by the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major criticism which the Opposition has regarding this committee of inquiry relates to the insufficient attention which is given in the terms of reference to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> implications of the financial system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the only section of the terms of reference relating to social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> can be found in paragraph (d) which recommends that the committee investigate: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of reference should clearly state that the committee of inquiry must give special attention to the effect of any changes in the Australian financial system on disadvantaged community groups and the functioning of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nor should I have to spell out again that a referendum in 1967 overwhelmingly gave the Commonwealth the responsibility of ensuring the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and rights of Aboriginal Australians by giving it power to make laws concerning those rights- a responsibility which this Governnent continues to evade, with the excuse that the States also retain such legislative powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an important question and essentially I am one in this Parliament who, on matters relating to Aboriginals, seeks to develop to the broadest possible extent the consensus that I believe is possible in matters relating to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and advancement of our Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I suggest first of all that the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier)  read the report on drugs by the Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in which it recommended the decriminalisation of marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member with an electorate that depends so much on the wool industry for its economic health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, I have some satisfaction in knowing that this Government is introducing machinery amendments to carry on the worthwhile and nationally accepted floor price scheme introduced by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it had considerable exposure to the education system, to other churches, to the American political system, to the media generally, to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations, to the legal system generally and to lawyers, and somehow it never failed the test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am serious when I say that because, down through the years, most of the significant reforms in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area have been initiatives taken on this side of the House by Liberal and National Country Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A reduced level of economic growth in turn makes it more difficult for the community as a whole, generally working through the Government, to provide those <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, education, health, and other services that modern communities seem increasingly to demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, within the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> society, we needed to establish the circumstances, particularly in relation to health, in which people would do for themselves what they could properly do for themselves, pay what they could be expected to pay for themselves and be protected by government only when the situation was likely to get beyond an individual’s or a family’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that this Government has discovered a new and brilliant mathematical formula for drawing up its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and manpower programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If individuals have access to appropriate training facilities thereby acquiring social and industrial skills, not only is the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the individual greatly enhanced but also when the economic upswing is underway there is room for a smooth expansion of demand and output without the inflationary cost pressures caused by skill bottlenecks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred to the recently publicised proposals of the Government’s health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> committee as one such possibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, this philosophy could and should be extended to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman),  whose recent criticism of me seems to indicate that he favours more income support for the wealthy, I regard the needs approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as being equitable and compassionate, for three main reasons: Firstly, it permits greater budgetary flexibility, thereby enabling governments to respond more quickly and more generously to newly emerging areas of poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it permits a greater concentration of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> resources on the needy and may allow those resources or benefits to be paid at a higher level and also to be protected from inflation, which often cannot be done with universally paid benefits because it is too costly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I refer to the need for having another look at our method of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> resource distribution, I acknowledge that we are looking at a complex problem with no straightforward solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee specifically points to health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see that this particular committee, of which the honourable member for Perth is a member, is not interested in maintaining the indexation of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits, or else it is not interested in maintaining the indexation of personal taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was popular once to pour money into education firmly in the belief that money would solve all problems but I think that we have found in this area and in a number of other areas such as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health- in fact, just about any field we have had anything to do with recentlythat money is not the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than income support for people on <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, they tend to provide programs like the food stamp program where literally billions of dollars of aid per year are transferred to the individual in terms of that kind of benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that education is a matter of a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last two or three years I have seen a continuing attack upon this whole attitude, and in listening to my colleagues opposite I find a continual denunciation of education expenditure and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was known as the NOW Centre-the North- West One-Stop <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was established within the city of Coburg and was designed to bring together the full range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services- the services of the Federal Department of Social Security, the services of the State Department of Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> and the services provided by some of the voluntary agencies in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most difficult problems for people receiving various forms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is that they are shunted from one to another among a whole variety of officers who deal with various types of allowances or various aspects of what very often is part of a human problem which ought to be dealt with as a whole and not separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My proposition is simply that the Government should consider the establishment in the city of Northcote of a Commonwealth Government centre which brings together the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security, possibly in some type of working relationship with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services provided by the Northcote Municipal Council and some of the voluntary agencies which exist in that city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been compounded by the fact that under the Labor Government’s program not only were funds provided via the Grants Commission but also funds were provided directly to local government for specific projects, such as employment generating initiatives, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance programs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a consequence, those municipalities which have the greatest need for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, child care services and employment projects have been affected, in Western Australia at least, in two ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1979, three years after the Horton committee reported, and after some months of letter writing, the Minister of Community <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> in South Australia received the following incredible epistle from the Minister for Home Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth expenditure for health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education has risen from 25 per cent 10 years ago to nearly 50 per cent at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the expenditure on health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education has doubled in the last 10 years, how much further can it go? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In raising this matter of public importance I call on the Government to take further measures to ensure that those most deserving in the community receive most of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar and, conversely, those least deserving or not deserving receive less or nothing from the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inherent in this proposition is that the proportion of Commonwealth expenditures attributable to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> must be contained and that a more equitable reallocation within the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> appropriation be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind the House that 10 years ago every 10 workers supported 1% <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The findings ofthe Senate Standing Committee on Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span>, which indicate that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system is out of hand and largely unaccounted for, must be considered very seriously indeed by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many other examples where <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, particularly allowances, have not been indexed to account for inflation and remain at the same figure as many years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, from my own experience I know of many other instances where <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollars are being grossly wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am, however, calling on the Government to ensure that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments are equitable and fair, that those in greatest need receive the greatest benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, if substantial savings are made within the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> appropriations as a result of these and other suggestions, we should seriously consider redistributing those savings to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients in greater need rather than sending them back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the Treasury Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly support the proposition that abuse and wastage, whether it is in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or any other government expenditure, must be restrained or eliminated, if that is at all possible, so that those who are in greatest need receive a more equitable share of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar, or the taxation dollar as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today we are not talking about ‘dole bashing’ as many of the newspapers in their editorials and members of the Opposition like to call any attempt to share more equitably and efficiently the resources available to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two extremes should not prevent people from constructively criticising abuse and recommending changes to improve the efficiency, equity and cost benefit of the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar to see that it goes to those in the greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Minister for Finance was then saying to the Assembly that the Fraser Government intended to take control of domestic Australian Capital Territory revenues raised from poker machines and the TAB and these revenues would not be used to increase the level of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services enjoyed by the people of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people in Canberra who are involved in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> work are considerably disturbed at the possibility that this body should undertake projects which, for instance, had nothing whatsoever to do with <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and which ignored the needy people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How were these funds, which were supposedly to provide for the people in need and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies, to be used for cultural, artistic and sporting purposes other than directly through an indoor recreation centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, if there is a creative, approach by both sides to these matters, we will see created, either with the Assembly’s approval or despite, a system of administering <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and community development funds in this Territory with which I hope everybody will be very happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week the honourable member for Calare  (Mr MacKenzie)  proposed for discussion a matter of public importance emphasising that the belief of Government members was that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> dollar, including the health dollar, should go to the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are consistent with our philosophy of concentrating <span class="highlight">welfare</span> towards those in genuine need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will then learn about specialists who believe that the socially disadvantaged should be treated only in hospitals; of doctors who pry out the embarrassing details of poverty from those who seek to be treated as socially disadvantaged; and of the doctor who will recognise no one as socially disadvantaged unless he has some kind of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to achieve an efficient, effective national and equitable health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, it is necessary to conduct on going evaluation … the consequences of not evaluating are possible indiscriminate cuts in funds, indiscriminate handing out of funds, continuance of the present ad hoc decision making process, perpetuation of the present inadequacies in the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system, and a possible lack of alternative solutions to problems in health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-There has recently been both parliamentary and public comment on the principles of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> disbursement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is possible to urge a needs approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, both in the interests of the needy and in the interests, of responsible budgetary management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the time I made my maiden speech in this place 1 have constantly said that we go about this objective in the wrong way- in a way which is against the best interests of the disadvantaged- by moving increasingly towards universal <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This tendency towards universal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is rather new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the universal method of disbursing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds leads to Budget inflexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, selectivity permits a greater concentration of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> resources on the needy and may allow those resources to be paid at a higher level and also to be protected from inflation, neither of which can be achieved with universally paid benefits because it is too costly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, needs based <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would certainly mean that society could be permitted to lower taxation levels, thereby helping to create employment and further increase overall living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to emphasise that we do not require a simple adjustment to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also think it is quite interesting to note that those who speak out strongly against handouts, high government expenditure and high taxes are so often the same people who receive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> assistance from the Government without being in the kinds of circumstances which make such assistance imperative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any formulation of a code of aims within our system I believe we must recognise that industrial capitalism has proved itself the most efficient means of increasing the wealth and hence potentially the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I make this plea to the Minister: If the Government wants an efficient and effective police force it should ensure that the provisions for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the members in respect of promotions, appeals and transfers, whether they are written into the Act or made by way of regulations, safeguard the rights of the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also influenced by the priorities which Aboriginals in different communities and regions attach to the provision of housing as compared with programs to meet other needs and by the extent to which State Governments through their housing authorites give priority to the housing needs of Aboriginals eligible for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In so doing, this would deprive the pensioners of Australia of increased benefits, because approximately 40 per cent of the money that is gathered from the fuel levy is expended on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my opinion that the taxpayers of Australia are paying far too much personal income tax and for the honourable member for Blaxland to advocate higher taxation, lower pensions and lower social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments is absolutely unacceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be asking the committee of the House of Assembly to give me advice as to the disposition of the $750,000 that relates to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the general community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the present Act imposes requirements related not only to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the crew and the structural safety of the ship but also to its manning, navigation, loading and unloading; to the carriage of dangerous cargoes, pollution of the sea and wreckage and salvage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Army establishment at Holsworthy, New South Wales, was added to my electorate in 1977, I have naturally taken an interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of serving members of the forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government had regard for all views, including those of the Northern Territory, during the framing of the Bills and the passing  of  the Acts relating to mining development, the establishment of townships, the protection of the environment and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House, mindful of the principles and philosophy of the Liberal Party to assist those in need, is anxious to protect the family and single people in the lower income groups from the worry of bills and charges for medical or hospital treatment due to illness or an accident, and therefore requests the Minister for Health to advise the medical profession that a confidential letter from a local justice of the peace, minister of religion, industrial chaplain or an officer of the Citizens Advice Bureau, Social Security or <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> or Probation, in relation to any patient, shall entitle that medical practitioner to accept the patient as ‘disadvantaged’ and refer any charges to the Commonwealth for payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is responsible for at least five major housing problems that are causing increasing hardship for low and middle income earners; that is, the two out of three workers who receive below average weekly earnings, those on pensions and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments and the unemployed who receive the miserable pittance that this Government calls an unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that approach we have been economically realistic but at the same time very sensitive to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> needs of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, on the best estimates and advice available to us of the position in the last financial year, the total amount available, from all the sources in public <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funding for housing was about the same as that for the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence shows that during the period of the Labor Government we had the longest waiting list in the history of this country of people seeking assistance from governments for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policies have started to bite and the numbers on these <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing waiting lists are falling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That sector is producing quality of life things such as education, information, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Government have before it a proposal which was designed to make the tax and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> system fairer and more equitable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when members of the Liberal and Country parties come into this chamber they forget about the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no wonder that those people whom I have mentioned in the motion, such as Australia’s Catholic bishops, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the responsible Minister in Victoria,  Mr Dixon,  and all the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies throughout Australia, can point to the Government the problems that are being confronted specifically by the young people but not only by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should not the Catholic bishops, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and all the other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agencies that carry this enormous burden speak up? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the election is fast approaching when the people of Australia will single out unemployment, job security, care, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and the opportunities that Australia should be giving to all its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>None has been so destructive of family security, as contemptuous of family <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or as corrosive of family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By failing to increase or index basic social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits the Budget permits a drastic erosion of payments on which many disadvantaged family units are dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same picture emerges when the absence of indexation is applied to other key <span class="highlight">welfare</span> allowances and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>‘convivial’ industries (to adopt the language of Ivan Illich) which are intended to promote the quality of life, but do not produce tangible goods or services which are capable of being exported or sold at a profit, for example, education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is almost 40 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget has taken almost 40c in the dollar of total Government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Over the last 10 years in Australia expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has increased almost sevenfold from $1.3 billion in 1969-70 to $5 billion in 1975-76, which was the last year of the Labor Government, to an estimated $8.9 billion in 1979-80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if adjustments are made for expenditure on family allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, the increased eligibility nevertheless means that expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76, Labor’s last Budget, to 21 per cent in the current Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that the Government’s import parity fuel policy has added a most significant indirect tax to the Government’s income armoury which has allowed the Government to reduce the deficit and to hand out some well deserved improvements in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When listing these points it would be wrong for me as  chairman  of the Government Members Health and <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Committee not to congratulate the responsible Ministers and the Cabinet on such measures as the reintroduction of twiceyearly indexation of pensions, increases in permissible earnings to retain eligibility of pensioner health benefit cards, the extension of the eligibility for pensioner health benefit cards and other fringe benefits to supporting parents, the increased capital allocations for the aged persons and senior citizens’ programs, the extension of service pensions to all allied ex-service personnel and the accelerated animal quarantine program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At one stage in 1975 he said, in the context of discussing the various claims that are made on the national exchequer, that to expect increases in education, to expect increases in <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, to expect greater health benefits and also to expect tax indexation was to ask for the impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One can look to other statistics for verification in order to gain the contrast between the concern for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of families in Australia under a Labor Government, and the brutal indifference of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 Budget Speech I announced that in the preceding year there had been an increase of 7 per cent in real terms in the income of the average income earner, and if one made allowances for redistributional benefits in the fields of education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, health and so on, the increase in real terms was 9.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is that this Government has allowed its ideological obsessions with this problem and with many others completely to obscure its view of the Australian community and its overall <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The vocal social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups have made some gains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unemployed, people on sickness benefits and those receiving the rent allowance- the poorest social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients in this country who do not have a voice- have clearly lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meanwhile, within the overall framework of the Budget, the Government has been able to restore important social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Total expenditure this financial year on the pensions will rise to $ 10,530m, about 40 per cent of the total <span class="highlight">welfare</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Government was stimulating the private sector, cutbacks were occurring in health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education showed a continual shift to the non-government schools, and in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> there was a freezing of many of the extra benefits; for example, supplementary benefits which have been unchanged since this Government has been in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They there has been simply the fact that the electorate looks very seriously at reductions, particularly at reductions in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A 9.6 per cent increase on last year’s expenditure is proposed in terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditures with a 10 per cent inflation rate expected at least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he imagines that that sort of approach to taxation is going to produce sufficient wealth for the vast social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> progams that no doubt a Labor government would want to perpetuate and increase, I think he has another think coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, after making a modest allowance for inflation, the Budget gives less to Canberra in total social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> appropriations, education appropriations, health appropriations, and the construction budget for the National Capital Development Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, condemnation is more in order as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending will actually drop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a Press interview, quoting figures about some individuals representing the party’s interests, the Minister for the Capital Territory said that congratulations had gone to the Government for the apparent fact that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure in the Territory is to rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condemnation is probably more the order of the day as <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending in the Australian Capital Territory will drop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending by the Department of the Capital Territory rose in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> allocations made by the Government are somewhat of a subterfuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is changing the picture as to what in fact happens with the funds as it proceeds to subsidise what should have been the responsibility of the Government- to maintain the level of expenditure in relation to those organisations which deal with people who are not in a position to help themselves in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area and to encourage those organisations to maintain their services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of Social Security contributed $ 1.32m and the revenue from poker machine funds added close to $ 1 m.

    <p>It had been opposed, predictably, by the Left, local government, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> lobbies and unions, and also by politicians of both sides, by the Press and by big business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1 974, the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made it quite clear that the Commission does not see itself as a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This we should do because the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of any individual is a function not so much of his own income but of the combined income of the family or household of which he or she is a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lest I be accused of caring only for the wealthy, let me say this: The competition for the available funds directed to <span class="highlight">welfare</span> each year is well known in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to kill the will, the incentive and the ability of the more fortunate in our community, in the future they will be putting their hands out to share in the restricted availability of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I passionately believe that a government of my Party’s persuasion has a very deep obligation to ensure that the stage is set not to allow people to dodge tax obligations but to ensure that the better off look after themselves so that when they reach old age their investments are caring for them and they do not become competitors for the restricted amount of money available for <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without trying to cover too many more subjects, I conclude with the observation that here we have well over 38 per cent of the nation ‘s Budget spent on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I advise the Opposition to get its feet on the ground and recognise the fact that the working man wants to take home as much of what he earns as possible while at the same time recognising he does have to make a contribution to the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government’s policies of restraint have not meant that we have shown no regard for those <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients in needy circumstances, although that seems to have come through in many speeches by members of the Opposition in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> record of this Government has been sound during a very difficult time for economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, we are concerned with furthering the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the needy in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As with previous Fraser Government Budgets, funding which goes to Aboriginal people has been cut in regard to housing, health, education, employment, enterprises, town management, public utilities, cultural and recreational funding, legal aid training and consultation and research- in fact, in every category except for general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> where there has been a small increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They say that the Government’s import parity fuel policy has added a most significant indirect tax to the Government’s income armoury which has allowed the Government to reduce the deficit and to hand out some well deserved improvements in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is in that area that one of the most significant changes is to be made to the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> area, but probably a more important change is the extension of Commonwealth fringe benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not increased family allowances this year even though it seems to think that is the jewel in its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand we have allegations that there have been cut-backs in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand we have assertions from some interest groups that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending is out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand groups are saying that there have been cut-backs and condemning the Government for the cut-backs and heartlessness; on the other hand, curiously, other groups are saying exactly the oppositethat social social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending is out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia over the past 10 years, expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> has increased almost sevenfold, from $1.3 billion in 1969-70 to $5 billion in 1975-76, and to an estimated $8.9 billion in 1979-80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if adjustments are made for spending on family allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, expenditure on social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76 to 2 1 per cent in 1979-80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past three financial years some $ 1 15.5m has been spent under the handicapped persons <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, those who say that they are opposed to the cutbacks in the social security budget and in social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> spending generally should specify where those cutbacks have been made and say how much they would increase expenditure in those areas and how the revenue to cover the increased expenditure should be raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, those who say that social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure is out of control, ought to specify where the surpluses are in current expenditure and be prepared to publicly justify cuts when the inevitable criticism comes to government for having taken drastic action to cut back expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look further than the immediate needs for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing which this Government has neglected and see what has happened even with those presently employed on low and middle incomes, and particularly those young couples or young people seeking their first home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been concerned in this area as in other important areas of potential redistribution, such as education, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, on the one hand to reduce the total volume of funds available and on the other to seek to ensure that the money that is spent is spent basically on behalf of its natural constituency, that is, on behalf of the better off, the more affluent or, if you like, the middle class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past it has relied on gaining the consent of the people through the use of a range of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, the education system, the media, the churches, the arbitration system, the law and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, I believe the Opposition has been effectively taken to task by the Australian Greek <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society, which is hardly a front for the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a temporary appointment which meets with the full satisfaction of the  Chairman  of the Ethnic Television Review Panel,  Mr Frank  Galbally, and it is one which the Australian Greek <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society has greeted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might go on to mention one more; the  President  of the Australian Yugoslav <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Society has also said that that Society fully supports the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of these is contemplated within our present ASIO Bill although I am firmly of the belief that all Australians should be possessed of some form of identification or social security number, as is the situation in the United States, in order to prevent the abuses under our Government’s <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and national health programs, but that is not related to the security of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments will: require a commissioner to consult with his  deputy president  before making or varying an award relating to wages and conditions; prohibit the Commission from ordering, recommending or sanctioning in any way, an employer paying wages to an employee for time when the employee was engaged in industrial action; provide for the expeditious hearing of stand-down applications, either before a single member of the Commission or a full bench; provide that the question of whether an industrial dispute exists may be the subject of a reference to a full bench; enable an industrial dispute or part of an industrial dispute to be referred to a full bench at the conciliation state; reinforce the powers of the  President  of the Commission by enabling him to withdraw a matter from another member of the Commission and either deal with it himself or refer the matter in a full bench; and provide increased protection for the community by creating an alternative path to the deregistration of organisations and thereby remove delays in the deregistration process in cases where the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community are put at risk by industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask you: How can one judge a man who one moment says he has insufficient funds for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing and the next has to struggle to hide a Budget surplus of $100m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government and, through it the Australian people, has given that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Knowing that there is that justified drawing power in relation to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, we have heard a confession of the general taxation policy of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition poured scorn on the late Richard Crosland who argued that <span class="highlight">welfare</span> could be delivered by means of greater economic growth; that greater economic growth would generate the resources that were able to be redistributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly the increased oil royalties received by the Government following the crude oil price increases by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, known as OPEC, greatly assisted the Government in not only reducing the deficit, but also enabled the Government to continue its social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies of assisting those most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder where the additional revenue is coming from- the sort of revenue that allows them to provide an extra $50m for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing, a 24 per cent increase in funds for youth and community services, a 34 per cent increase in other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> areas and a 55 per cent increase for pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forty-eight special project grants with total expenditure of $150,000 were made in 1978- 79 to encourage self-help among ethnic groups and to help trade unions in providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to migrant members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we come to the 48 special project grants, which were offered to encourage self help among ethnic groups and to help trade unions in providing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services to migrants, with a total expenditure of $ 1 50,000, this sounds good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If two or more of those members do anything which in the words of this amending Bill affects the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this country a declaration can be sought from the Commission that if such behaviour occurs again within six months the union will be deregistered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We can understand that, but when we look at the words used in the Bill we wonder what does not affect the health, safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That affected the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Australians but the Government does not interpret its action in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything that is done in this country affects the safety, health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of people, but the Prime Minister wants to kick the trade union movement and use it as the last resort in order to stay Prime Minister of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister decides that an issue affecting the health, safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community is of such importance that deregistration action should be taken, he must make application to the Full Bench and he has to justify his position in a Full Bench hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Port Adelaide asked quite piously: ‘What sorts of disputes could affect the health, safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government, when the health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community are obviously at some peril, cannot respond to the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed new section 143 A, which is sought to be inserted into the Act, will give to the Governor-General a wide range of powers which may be exercised against unions which take industrial action which has a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed section allows the Minister to apply for a declaration from a full bench of the Commission that industrial action by a union or its members has had, is having or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main features are that the Minister- and I stress that it is the Minister- may apply to the Full Bench of the Commission for a declaration that industrial action by an organisation, or a group of its members, has had, is having, or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community or a part of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we take the view that the public does matter and, as a consequence, we are providing in this legislation that deregistration can occur on grounds of safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It empowers a full bench to make a relevant declaration where it is satisfied that two persons have in the past been engaged in industrial action- for example, a ban- which has had a substantial effect on the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> part of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member failed to say, of course, that the Minister will intervene only when matters such as the safety, the health and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the honourable member and the Labor Party have us say that the Government should not be concerned about the safety, the health or the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would they say that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community would not be affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that the Labor Party is not concerned with the health, the safety or the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community because it would deny the Minister an opportunity to act for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite are saying that the Government of Australia is not concerned about <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, safety or health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are saying: ‘You allow us to have safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>; you allow us to earn our money; you allow us to attend to the wellbeing of our families. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A declaration may be made if it is held that industial action is adversely affecting the health, safety and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not necessary to show that industrial action is having an adverse effect on health and safety if it can be shown simply that a strike is against the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community the certificate has to be issued - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a strike involving shipping, transport, the post office or any public facilities, it can be easily argued that the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community is affected by it substantially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, as the Treasurer is a member of the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Committee of Cabinet, will the Acting Treasurer ask the Treasurer whether he will also refer the proposals for analysis and report by the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Secretariat which was established by the Government to co-ordinate development of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 give an undertaking to the honourable member for Sturt that the report on his proposal will be available as quickly as possible and on the Treasurer’s return this weekend I will put to him for consideration the suggestion that the proposal should go to the Social <span class="highlight">Welfare</span> Policy Secretariat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that the Government and the people of Australia will pull their full weight because, as I said earlier, our record in respect of Kampuchea is going to be seen by the world as demonstrable evidence that Australians do care and that we are concerned for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our fellow human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where are the decisions that have been so vital to the industrial <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or the economy of this country which have so upset the Government that it has to introduce such a draconian measure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the industrial action has had, is having, or is likely to have, a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community or of a part of the community, the Full Bench shall make a declaration that it is so satisfied and cause the declaration to be recorded in writing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill, once a certificate is issued by the Conciliation Commission to the effect that there is a stoppage of work in a particular union which affects the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community, the Minister will have the right to declare that particular members of that union shall not be eligible to continue to hold office, or that particular members of the union shall not be eligible to contest a ballot for office, or that particular members of a union may not be eligible to record a vote in an election for union officials, or that a particular member or members shall be prohibited from attending a union meeting, voting at a union meeting or attending a meeting of workers on a particular job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child care centres, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services, senior citizens’ centres, various recreational facilities and public libraries are vital in supporting people at particularly vulnerable times of their lives or in ensuring more satisfying leisure activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a real danger not only that local government will be forced to restrain severely growth of community services such as education, <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, recreation and cultural activities, but also that public works of various kinds will be allowed to deteriorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that in countries where <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services are advanced- England, Holland, Sweden and Denmark, for instance- local councils are playing a more and more important and responsible part in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is humanely and economically senseless to spend $ 1,000m this year on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments to unemployed people while there is so much important socially useful work that needs to be done and which could provide gainful and satisfying jobs for the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is a real and pressing casefor decentralisation of authority and that local governments will best perform many governmental functions in such critical areas as <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, culture and the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There now appears to be a general agreement that local government is the most appropriate unit for the planning, administration and delivery of a wide range of community <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services and facilities because it can take account of the different needs, values and preferences of individual communities and because it is the political unit closest to the communities being served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A Liberal and National Country Party government views local government as the focus for service delivery, since <span class="highlight">welfare</span> services provided at the local level will be very responsive to users’ needs and wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government boasts of significant increases in expenditure in various areas of immigrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, but the truth of the matter is that it is the immigrants themselves who will now be paying for the services the Government has appeared to offer so generously on the prompting of the Gal bally report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only are immigrants now asked to pay for the administrative costs they incur at a time when they are least able to pay for them, but they are the ones from whom money is to be taken to pay for the supporting programs designed as immigrant <span class="highlight">welfare</span>- the props and supports designed to give immigrants greater equality with other Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as there is now a significant component in the immigration <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program which is really directed at and for refugees, one could claim that immigrants generally will be paying for their own postarrival <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and for that of refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from the procedural amendments which I have described, another part of the legislationthis was referred to briefly by the Leader of the Opposition- provides for accelerated deregistration procedures for unions or sections of unions whose actions are substantially adversely affecting the safety, health or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As was pointed out in the recent interim statement of the Department, the overriding objective of the Government is to build up a department which is both efficient and compassionate, with a recognition that these two values, far from being in conflict, are the twin pillars around which a truly effective <span class="highlight">welfare</span> operation must be designed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first objective is to plug a number of gaps and anomalies in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition welcomes most of these efforts at greater consistency and the effort to make more comprehensive and solid the protective social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> framework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, the package of Bills aims to continue and reinforce the Government’s treatment of the unemployed, not merely as second-class citizens but as second-class <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first objective of these measures is to plug a number of gaps and anomalies in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provision in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With only minimal administrative changes and relatively small expenditure increases, a much more comprehensive <span class="highlight">welfare</span> floor could have been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third and most contemptible of the objectives of these Bills is the further development of this Government’s policy of treating the unemployed not merely as second class citizens, but as second class <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dole bludger epithet may now be rejected in Government rhetoric, but the dole bludger syndrome is alive and active in the reality of this Government’s social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they had received these adjustments, as has practically every other <span class="highlight">welfare</span> beneficiary, their benefit in November would be some $7 a week more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again discriminates against the unemployed as compared with nearly all other categories of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> recipients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But these Bills do more than simply tolerate the existing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> discrimination against the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the Government seeks to further use social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> as an instrument in industrial warfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be very interested to know whether the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck)  supports that use of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this quite savage <span class="highlight">welfare</span> punishment of unionists as the result of the industrial action of fellow unionists is wrong in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite inappropriate to use social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> provisions in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the present Budget a sum of $8.9 billion has been allocated in the general area of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indicative of this success has been the increase in the total number of  recipients  of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> which is theirs injustice, not in charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in the Budget of a government of concern and interest in the unfortunate in society the allocation for <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is about 28.2 per cent of the total Budget allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eighty-five per cent of personal income tax collections in Australia is spent on health and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party in 1973 allocated 20.4 per cent of our income to social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a long history of conservative governments being prepared to spend sometimes very significant amounts of money on social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that is that, historically speaking, social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditure has operated to a greater or lesser extent as an instrument of social control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, it is possible on occasions to use <span class="highlight">welfare</span> expenditures as a means of damping down the fires of discontent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about the increased amounts that have necessarily been spent on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> in the time when this Government has been in power, we have only to look at the unemployment statistics to understand why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had to spend considerably increased amounts of money on <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because unemployment creates a potentially revolutionary situation, a situation in which conflict of very serious proportions is produced in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we turn to what is being proposed in this legislation tonight in relation to unemployment beneficiaries, we see that it is simply a continuation of that kind of story of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, not in terms of the achievement of justice, not in terms of delivering to people what is their right, but rather in the form of an attempt further to harass people and make them feel that somehow they have to get more into line and that somehow they are being deviant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That has nothing to do with social <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has nothing to do with <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, and yet that is part of this social security legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only possible help will come from State <span class="highlight">welfare</span> departments, which have limited emergency funds and which in some States they are unwilling to hand over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has learned nothing from the 1977 four-week Latrobe Valley strike, which threw every <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisation into chaos from which they were finally rescued by a joint Commonwealth-State grant of $100,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have grown up with the notion that somehow work is related to participation in a particular kind of economic system, that it is related to working in organisations that are primarily devoted to a profit rather than being related essentially to making some sort of contribution to community <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to reply very briefly to the comments of the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  when he suggested that members on this side of the House had less than a passing interest in the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of our returned men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But, corresponding to what I have been saying about capital works, if one looks at the particular areas of spending, such as health, education and <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, one will see that the cutbacks are much more obvious and one will see the implications of the Government’s strategy much more clearly displayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">welfare</span> branch, of course, which is a band-aid organisation, does excellent work, but there is nothing to handle the youth support schemes as there is in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention that the departments covering the areas of health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education spend about $14.5 billion per annum, which is about 46 per cent of the total outlays of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to secure the future of the homeless persons <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program by removing from the enabling legislation reference to a prescribed period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsidies valued at $320,000 are also being provided for 44 social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers at 40 centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The program, by assisting with rental subsidies and social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker subsidies, has been able to contribute to the development of the halfway house concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This allows for placement of clients in a residential setting while they are assisted in adjusting to the many demands of a different life style by social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers funded under the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, the definition of ‘social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker’ has been interpreted in the widest possible sense under the program, the main criterion being that a worker provides a personal <span class="highlight">welfare</span> service to homeless people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Substantial sums of Commonwealth money are given to the Queensland Government for the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and advancement of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is failing in the area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and in the area of the advancement of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot see any <span class="highlight">welfare</span> or advancement in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at the situation in terms of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and advancement, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> would relate to good personal health, hygiene, a good diet and the right sort of environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of destroying these people if we leave their <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to the likes of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be able to say to the Aboriginal people: ‘We are genuinely concerned about your <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, expenditure on health, hospitals and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> is the lowest for any State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the Committee noted that there was a lack of the appropriate data required to assess the need for greater passenger <span class="highlight">welfare</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill because it secures the future of the homeless persons <span class="highlight">welfare</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now there has not been any guarantee that this program would be an on-going one, which has meant that neither the Government nor the organisations delivering this <span class="highlight">welfare</span> have been able to undertake long term planning of programs designed to assist homeless men and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some valuable government assistance also has been provided through capital grants, food and accommodation subsidies, rental subsidies and subsidies for the salaries of social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers, but until now the Act has required statutory extensions following periods of evaluation and review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By removing from the enabling legislation reference to a prescribed period the status of this Act and of those organisations and individuals operating under it has been enhanced and the Act can now be given the long term <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priority which it rightly deserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to social contact, there has been a high usage of church or <span class="highlight">welfare</span> centres and a virtual absence of family ties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is the church and other charitable organisations which the Government, under this Act, is trying to encourage to stay in this field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> to help the homeless and destitute people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations such as the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Jesus People- which is a uniquely Western Australian group who look after the homeless group in Western Australia and do an excellent job- must remain in this field of <span class="highlight">welfare</span> because the people they are helping are those who are often referred to as ‘skid row’ people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that governments should provide all the finance required to care properly for this area of <span class="highlight">welfare</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this were done much of the essential spirit and dignity which comes from the church and charitable and other non-profit <span class="highlight">welfare</span> organisations would disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That figure represents 0.01 per cent of the Budget outlays for 1979-80 which are classified as social security and <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to refer also to the salary subsidies, which amount to 50 per cent of the salary of a social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> worker employed at a homeless persons’ assistance centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  at present subsidies valued at $320,000 are being provided for 44 social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers at 40 different homeless persons’ centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers need formal qualifications in order to be eligible for this subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the purpose of these centres is to provide some scope for rehabilitation rather than just to mount a salvaging operation, additional suitably trained staff, quite apart from social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> officers, may be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One 35-bed hostel in my electorate employs nine <span class="highlight">welfare</span> workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem is an almost inevitable consequence of the conflict which occurs in determining <span class="highlight">welfare</span> priorities when universal payments assume a significance, both political and budgetary, which precludes a flexible approach in appropriating funds to emerging areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more we rely upon universal payments in the social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> field, the more that prevents a total concentration of scarce resources in areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Government is seeking to stress the criterion of need as the basis of disbursing <span class="highlight">welfare</span> funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding this desirable method of administering a <span class="highlight">welfare</span> policy, I think that we have a long way to go and the homeless persons assistance program highlights that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it strange that in a country of 14 million people, strongly endowed with the world’s most valuable resources, enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world and spending $14.7 billion annually on health, <span class="highlight">welfare</span> and education, areas of real need involving minuscule appropriations remain relatively ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather a question of priorities between universality and selectivity in <span class="highlight">welfare</span> payments, which I have debated time and again in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps there is a tendency for policy makers in democratic systems to listen to the highly organised and highly articulate <span class="highlight">welfare</span> groups, which leads mainly to income transfers being made from middle income earners to other middle income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the reason, I strongly suggest to the Minister for Social Security, who has constantly advocated a needs approach to <span class="highlight">welfare</span>, that she give a top priority to re-examining the present funding levels under this Act which services a very needy section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the people of Australia that notwithstanding the need to spend much more money in this area there are parallel schemes in existence: $3m has been made available on a dollartodollar basis with the States for the provision of youth support schemes; various family support service schemes, the community health programs and the <span class="highlight">welfare</span> housing programs are operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That means that ultimately if anything goes wrong the blame, broadly speaking, will not be taken by public servants who are guaranteed protection through the Public Service Act and other social <span class="highlight">welfare</span> benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account formula is for 40 per cent of the royalty payments for minerals extracted from the land to be paid to land councils, 30 per cent to be paid to the local traditional owners of the land concerned, and the remaining 30 per cent to be paid towards the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That formula is to be departed from by taking some money out of the 30 per cent for the general <span class="highlight">welfare</span> of Aborigines in the Northern Territory and giving it to the land councils to cover extra administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The worst way, the method adopted in this Bill, is to destroy the AUS, to make it less representative by interfering with the tradition of academic freedom and to prohibit the councils of tertiary institutions from enabling fees to be paid except for very narrow- one might say, almost selfishpurposes confined to ‘student <span class="highlight">welfare</span>’, narrowly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
