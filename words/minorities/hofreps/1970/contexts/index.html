<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he make an early statement on the allegations quoted in the white paper on pages 23 and 24 that United States policy has betrayed hill tribes in northern Laos by fostering their hopeless opposition to the North Vietnamese and then deserting them, contrary to Australian and allied stated policies not to jettison beleaguered <span class="highlight">minorities</span> requesting our support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the opening part of the question, I think I should say very forthrightly that the constitutionally elected government would not be prepared to allow <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to take control of the conduct of its business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, organisers of relatively small protest marches and demonstrations have been unable, even when they wished to do so, to exclude or control those extremist <span class="highlight">minorities</span> whose methods of operation are repugnant to all decent citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The smaller countries will continue to have many problems - political instability, economic rivalry, territorial disputes and trouble from <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and racial and sectarian groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such a situation, some of those who fought the Vietcong and some <span class="highlight">minorities</span> who had done nothing wrong would certainly suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic philosophical issue for our democratic society is that there are rights for <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, lt Ls no: a democracy that is run by a majority which believes that a decision made by the majority must at all times bc upheld, even whore it arises as a result of moral standards which become somewhat osified in a conservative environment because they have not been subjected to critical scrutiny as frequently and as intensively as should be desirable in a liberal society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also philosophical values of the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time some members of the Government go out of their way to excuse the unruly behaviour of other <span class="highlight">minorities</span> which oppose the Moratorium less peacefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To indicate our point of view, at the anniversary meeting of the General Assembly on the 24th of next month - it is a special meeting - a declaration will be made relating to the rights of individuals, particularly the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in certain countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the 2 things are entirely different though, of course, as we will have noticed with great regret in this nation, even though people may be of the same colour they do have, when they are racial <span class="highlight">minorities</span> of significance, tensions which can lead to the kind of actions which have recently been taking place in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whatever justification there may be for pooling shares’ at a lime of vast technological change such as the industry  is  now going through, and with the need to promote and aid any new development likely to yield a more economic service, the question should be faced as to whether those members of a conference, by their voting strength alone, should be able  to  hamstring the enterprise of national <span class="highlight">minorities</span> whose ships have proved their worth, by refuging a reasonable share, by  over-tonning  the trade,  or  by any course save by providing an equal or better service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only hope that eventually honourable members opposite will remember that the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, the right to free discussion and the opportunity to debate matters of national importance are what the Parliament is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated before in this House and outside it that the Government believes it essential to protect the civil rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> but it believes it equally essential to protect the civil rights of the majorities and will not permit organised <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to go beyond the law and interfere with the rights of the majorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heroin abuse is primarily a disease of repressed <span class="highlight">minorities</span>: 50.4 per cent of the users are Negro, 13.6 per cent are Puerto Rican and 5.4 per cent are Mexican. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the exploitation of the preferential voting system as exemplified by splinter groups,  2  other changes are necessary - change in the voting method to prevent the’ election of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and a draw for the position of a candidate’s name on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as important for the future of our democracy to safeguard the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to dissent as it is to safeguard the majority against the excesses of the dissenters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the few anti-democratic violent <span class="highlight">minorities</span> get away with it, then the rights of all legitimate dissenting <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>.In fact, the Bill sets out only what <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in particular cannot do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has always talked in terms of the pressure of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and the usurpation of the rights of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very little latitude is permitted in either of these countries for individuals or <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to express their criticisms of their governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a democratic society cannot subordinate so grossly the rights - of individuals and <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, as the Government does through this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not have to rationalise its case to individuals, to <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and to the growing number of people who are becoming resentful of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many aspects on which it can be taken apart and on which it can be displayed that this Government is applying unreasonable pressure and unreasonable bias against <span class="highlight">minorities</span> who care to challenge its opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill comes down heavily against the lawful rights of individuals and <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to assemble and to express their individual and group views in an attempt to change opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object to what the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Kennedy)  said about how this Bill relates to <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill aims at protecting <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, even little <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was completely fallacious for the honourable member for Angas to argue that this Bill is one that will protect the rights, of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In civilised discussions of decisions between majorities and <span class="highlight">minorities</span> we have to accept the rule that even though the other chap does not have the numbers we have to listen to him some of the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must have a  short  memory if one forgets what the Russians did in Hungary or Czechoslovakia, or the present persecution of the Jewish people, the Baptists and other <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his VIP aircraft jetting to the sprawling sores of Sydney he does not see the rape of the countryside by the affluent urbane <span class="highlight">minorities</span> of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that democracies take note that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are trying to force their will on majorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a man who leads  li  million people and rules 19 million people and talks about the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis has always been on our ability to integrate, to assimilate people and to avoid the setting up of small national <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not treat them as minority groups, because you are doing no greater an injustice to the people whom you claim you represent than by acting as though they are <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will use this sort of information as part of our election campaign because we are here to protect the interests of all the people, not the small <span class="highlight">minorities</span> which use these tactics against the basic people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area in which there is endemic insurgency for a whole variety of reasons - because of poverty, because there are traditional societies in movement and in change where all kinds of tensions arise, because they have large ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and because in many cases their powers are by no means certain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the difficulties of democratic governments in dealing with large scale lawlessness organised by tightly knit subversive <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument is that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> should be better and more specifically represented than the 2-party system allows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It just happens to be the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> who get booted around if the opportunity offers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a right to present minority opinions and to put a case for <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of parliamentary democracy is that there is concern for the interests of all the people, that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> really matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stage has not yet perhaps been reached where it has produced a sense of alienation that is associated with some other overridden <span class="highlight">minorities</span> around the world, and I pray God that it will never reach that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">minorities</span> have been provided for at long last and the philosophy of this was evident in the report tabled by the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>been tender to the claims of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and to the rights of free association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the persecution of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> by this so-called Government concerned with the rights of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government to government and business to business assistance throughout the world unfortunately tends to perpetuate privileged <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and this leads to a lack of any real material progress being passed on to the mass of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be because there are many ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in the electorate who have never bothered to become naturalised or it may be that it is a seat with a young population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lack of formal qualifications among women is exceeded by a greater lack in men in some of these groups; and of course the women of the Aboriginal race, ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and migrant communities suffer special disabilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>might well find that people in tie underprivileged <span class="highlight">minorities</span> will have their rights trampled upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not talking about the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> that try to tyrannise everybody else everywhere else in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Democracy includes the opportunity for <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to have their voices heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was worked on the basis that it catered for <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he ask for an amelioration of attitudes over the treatment of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> within that community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a vocal minority on both sides and I would like to say something about these vocal <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to commit ourselves to all powerless <span class="highlight">minorities</span> that need our help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It evidences a torment of conscience, perhaps, of contemporary society for the way in which it has been derelict in its duties and responsibilities over the years to some of the unfortunate <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I look upon it perhaps as a second home in some ways, but I am sure that the great majority of the people in New South Wales would agree with me that it is not only their more populous numbers which are to be considered in these matters which affect the whole country but the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> have some rights under our Constitution since it was based on the principle that smaller States and indeed other States would have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall deal at some length with the Aboriginals because their treatment in this Budget perfectly illustrates the qualities of this Government- its dishonesty, its pitiless treatment of inarticulate and unorganised <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, the underhand methods of the Prime Minister, his withholding of information, his abdication of the national Government’s responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the Australian Government has very sensibly re-established our diplomatic relations with Chile to their normal level by appointing a new ambassador, our trade with that country is being disrupted by the action of communist <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in certain trade unions, particularly the maritime and waterfront unions which have placed a black ban on all trade with Chile, a black ban I might add which has never been placed on trade with other communist dictatorships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
