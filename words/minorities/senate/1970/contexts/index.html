<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a situation upon which every Australian should reflect, because it is of grave concern that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> can create such a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this consideration in mind, and since the question of the status of the Slovene and Croatian <span class="highlight">minorities</span> has not been proposed for inscription on the agenda of any UN body this year, action by the Australian Government along the lines sought in the petition presented by the honourable senator would not be appropriate at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect that concerns me greatly is the growing trend in this country - a trend that 1 feel is a danger to the democracy and freedom that we have won over the years, and a trend that is condoned by many - to buck authority, the laws of the land and our law making institutions under the guise of freedom of speech, the rights of the individual and the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope he does not believe that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are not worth bothering about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you believe in the principle of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> then you cannot make selections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, as the Territory evolves towards self government, <span class="highlight">minorities</span> will have to accept the decisions of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is meant to limit the power of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is meant to limit the power of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> which do not agree with government or administrative policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some of our universities it has been successfully moved at meetings of the students that there shall be no student representative council, that every student in fact shall be a law unto himself and the small <span class="highlight">minorities</span> can do as they like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no racial <span class="highlight">minorities</span> within our boundaries to cause us those unending and so far insoluble conditions so acutely suffered by some countries at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to that part of the honourable senator’s question which would invite me to admonish members of the Australian Labour Party,  I  would renounce that operation as something in vain I would let them share the responsibility that is properly in the judgment of the public for supporting violent <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has variously described the Government, Ministers and the Government’s policies over the years as cruel, vindictive, inconsiderate, downtreading <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and having no consideration for people who are the poor and needy in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen comments that such radical <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are using university campuses for the purpose of underground operations in defiance and disruption of law and order instead of study? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is Important to preserve the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government has gone as far as this Government has gone in recognising the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Labor government in the past has ever put on the statute book legislation protecting the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> as this Government has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a perversion of the truth to believe that we discharge our duties when we look after the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen comments that such radical <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are using university campuses for the purpose of underground operations in defiance and disruption of law and order instead of study? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to intervention in aid of protection of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, that too is being closely watched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it can be said that there was some mandate by majority at the last election, <span class="highlight">minorities</span> have to be given some recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a society which is essentially undivided, without permanent <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and free of avoidable tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been heard to express very strongly in this Parliament my views that our duty is to uphold the rights of both majorities and <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not opposed to re-plays of football on Sunday mornings provided that the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Government in allowing these programmes at these times has not taken any action at all to protect the rights of those <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should have taken action by this time to protect the public interest and the rights of the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> which are so often referred to by this Government and also by the Control Board in its annual reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is in the interests of the public to have sporting programmes on Sunday morning and if it is in the interests of the public to protect <span class="highlight">minorities</span> then the Government should have legislated to ensure quotas at other times for the programmes which the Board itself has described as Australian programmes of merit and programmes for minority interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is a minority view for a parliamentarian, at least <span class="highlight">minorities</span> have their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just wonder whether the Government realises how far some of the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> here can step out as far as demonstrations are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was electoral reform and it gave people and the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> the right to have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to broaden the Electoral Act to the extent of granting some form of franchise to people between the ages of 18 and 21 years we should take the further step of seriously considering whether <span class="highlight">minorities</span> should have the right to representation in this chamber and in the other place in accordance with the number of people who vote for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the majority decision -  stated that it is cruel and unusual to apply the death penalty selectively to <span class="highlight">minorities</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: ‘ … to apply the death penalty selectively to <span class="highlight">minorities</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to build a mechanism into a democracy to ensure that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> get a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find this surprising for a Government which prides itself on having some concern for the special situation of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and which has talked about the special needs of groups of people, of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and of people who are in some particular and peculiar circumstances whether in the field of social welfare, education, the arts or communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it surprising that a Government which talks about the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> constantly being protected and preserved does not follow this theme through into the field of electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>district then <span class="highlight">minorities</span> are assured of representation, and in that respect the system has its virtue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also make a statement of Australia ‘s attitude and policy towards the Governments of Mozambique and Rhodesia, and allegations made in relation to the alleged persecution of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not aware of any recent allegations of the persecution of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in Mozambique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Government has supported a minority government in Chile, and it has a tendency to support <span class="highlight">minorities</span> except when it suits it to go to the people, as it will on another referendum, and say: ‘ We want to oppose <span class="highlight">minorities</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt at all that honourable senators are well aware- it is fresh in their minds -of the persecution of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the treatment of Jewish <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in a number of Arab countries is of such a nature as would inspire any Israeli to have the utmost fear of what could be done to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one could do anything but deplore the treatment of the Jewish <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in the great majority of, if not all, Arab countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could not see in it any great reform and he pointed out that the objection always to anything of this nature comes from the fact that it can lock up large <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in certain seats and in effect give those <span class="highlight">minorities</span> no say in the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a number of seats the Australian Democratic Labor Party has quite sizable <span class="highlight">minorities</span> but it does not get one member in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the most democratic form of election is the proportional representation system which ensures that the representation in the parliament will reflect completely the will of all the people who are entitled to vote and which will give the <span class="highlight">minorities</span> as well as the majorities the right to have voices in the parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is any question that the treatment of the ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, the culture and the language of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania under the Soviet Union is something of which the Soviet Union cannot at all be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except for a few racial <span class="highlight">minorities</span> that exist around the country- there are 42 million people making up those racial <span class="highlight">minorities</span> but they represent only 6 per cent of the populationall religion in the socialist State is forbidden by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to a recent article in the ‘Peking Review’, the wellestablished mouthpiece of the Chinese Government, which refers to Soviet control of the Baltic States ‘ as ruthless suppression and a policy of arbitrary assimilation of the national <span class="highlight">minorities</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the considered statements that that sort of insurgency and outside assistance will not come in to help <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in Indonesia to overthrow the government there, with whom we have good relations, or to overthrow the government of Malaysia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first past the post voting system produces situations in which <span class="highlight">minorities</span> may well, and in fact often do, govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time one million Australians are involved because approximately one million Australians belong to ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in various parts of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The acid test of a state or regime is the nature of its conduct towards <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and smaller nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, neglect or oppression of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and the exploitation of other countries, which occurs irrespective of professed ideologies, is the mark of the imperialist state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the average Australian is in no position to preach to others about the treatment of national <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who support these changes should say whether they believe in optional preferential voting and whether they believe that Independents or <span class="highlight">minorities</span> should not have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government then brings forward an electoral package and, on its own say-so, will bring in optional preferential voting which destroys the principle of one vote one value, which wipes out the <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, which fails to ensure the complete transfer of the preferential system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick  said that it should be determined by the number of electors and that those migrant groups- the ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> which tend to be heavily concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne- should not be counted for purposes of determining electoral boundaries because they are not naturalised citizens and do not have a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We rarely have the opportunity in the Senate to debate issues which relate in any way to questions of religious tolerance or the rights of religious <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has the Shah gone, but Iran does not have a moderate Paris university professor like  Dr Mossadegh;  it has the Ayatollah Khomeini, who wants to cut off people’s hands, who wants to persecute <span class="highlight">minorities</span> like the Bahais, the Jews, the Christians, the Zoroastrians and the free thinkers of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The situation as it might affect people in Iran is still confused and no clear indication of the new government’s attitude to Iran’s religious and ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> has yet emerged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I readily acknowledge that citizen initiative does enjoy some current popularity in certain overseas countries, particularly the United States, it is true that the idea of citizen initiative and a referendum dates from the time, and was most fashionable at the time, when nations were essentially run by elites elected by rich and powerful <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, when full adult franchise was unknown, when representative democracy was not fully developed, and when there was genuine frustration at the absence of an opportunity for the popular voice to make itself heard in the business of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I sensed his attitude correctly, I believe that he is interested in the rights of individuals and of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have robust compromises, that is true, and all kinds of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> on occasions which have nothing to do with party political matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister say whether the ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in Tasmania are included in these studies and when the results will be available? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not include ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> in Tasmania, but it is hoped that the results of the study will have a general application to other ethnic groups as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The communique made nine points: The Heads of Government: confirmed that they were wholly committed to genuine black majority rule for the people of Zimbabwe; recognised, in this context, that the internal settlement constitution is defective in certain important aspects; fully accepted that it is the Constitutional responsibility of the British Government to grant legal independence to Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule; recognised that the search for a lasting settlement must involve all parties to the conflict; were deeply conscious of the urgent need to achieve such a settlement and bring peace to the people of Zimbabwe and their neighbours; accepted that independence on the basis of majority rule requires the adoption of a democratic constitution including appropriate safeguards for <span class="highlight">minorities</span>; acknowledged that the government formed under such an independence constitution must be chosen through free and fair elections, properly supervised under British Government authority, and with Commonwealth observers; welcomed the British Government’s indication that an appropriate procedure for advancing towards these objectives would be for them to call a Constitutional conference to which all parties would be invited; and consequently, accepted that it must be a major objective to bring about a cessation of hostilities, and an end to sanctions as part of the process of implementation of a lasting settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I reiterate that Australia and this Parliament cannot underestimate the danger of passing these amendments to one Act and thus introducing a new Act which has no teeth and which is merely a window dressing exercise which the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  on his recovery from flu and pneumonia, will be able to take back to Lusaka and parade on the stages of the world, saying ‘There is no racism in my country’, while the people of this country, including those who are less than white, those who are part of the more ethnic <span class="highlight">minorities</span> and those who are refugees in this country, will continue to suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these measures, as proposed to be amended, are carried through in their entirety, we will have left no laws with any teeth for the protection of the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, particularly the coloured <span class="highlight">minorities</span>, of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The erosion of freedoms that will be suffered by <span class="highlight">minorities</span> is implicit in the very wording of the proposed amendments to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this part of my argument demonstrates that the proposition that people can rely upon the operations of the common law, leave it to judges, to tradition, to history and to the good sense of people in the community simply does not exist when there are pressures- the pressures against blacks, the pressures against Vietnamese refugees, the pressures of unemployment or anything else- because one of the first things that is sacrificed when those sorts of conditions prevail are the human rights of other people and essentially the human rights of voiceless and defenceless <span class="highlight">minorities</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that there is a demonstrable need for the legal protection of human rights which are all too subject to the whim of the majority of the day, to the most base and ignorant predjuices of the day and the situations where <span class="highlight">minorities</span> receive as limited an amount of protection from majorities as can possibly be eked out by the inadequate measures that we have at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It exists where the rights of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to dissent by way of verbal expression and even by way of practice, as long as it is nonviolent, are ensured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs advises that the Soviet Union and governments in Eastern Europe, including Romania’s, continue to deny fundamental civil and political rights to their citizens and that <span class="highlight">minorities</span> often suffer most in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It requires that we recognise the right of dissent, the right of <span class="highlight">minorities</span> to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
