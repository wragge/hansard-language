    <p>Will <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> who have tribal title to the area being mined receive any portion of the royalty; if so, what percentage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts been drawn to legislation being introduced in the Victorian Parliament by which penalties for air pollution in that State will be drastically increased as a result of a maximum penalty of $5,000 being imposed for the contravention of any of the provisions of the Clean Air Act and a maximum penalty of $2,000 being imposed for each day the offence continues after conviction or an order by a court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst recognising that the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts is a newly established Department and obviously some reasonable lime is necessary to obtain full efficiency, the Committee, in its examination of the Estimates of the Department, found that there was a considerable degree of confusion, lack of information and slow progress in reaching establishment in certain areas, particularly the section dealing with the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While no special provisions for the relief of unemployment among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are included in the Non-Metropolitan Unemployment Relief Scheme, special employment assistance for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in non-metropolitan areas is available through Commonwealth funds granted to the States under the States Grants (Aboriginal Adpancement) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increased numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are expected to be employed under this scheme as a result of the greatly increased grants to the States for Aboriginal advancement already announced for 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Doubtless the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, whom I represent, has also seen it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the question is directed to me as representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, although I imagine that the question should be directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister ‘ agree that the project implies that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are more incestuous than other Australians, and is therefore insulting to the decent and law-abiding Aboriginal citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLAND - The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: (1), (2) and (3) Records of the National Health and Medical Research Council disclose that the Council has not, during the past two years, approved any medical research project specifically intended to investigate the incidence of incest among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory (Administration) Act provides for the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund into which all royalties from mining on Aboriginal reserves are paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay and urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people then introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act; secondly, the regulations that were brought down on 4 December 1972; and thirdly the bylaws that operate in the various communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion which the good senator makes about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland being free to make their own decisions is not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might even add that those threats were going further back than the present Minister; they were going back to the previous Minister who was threatening Queensland that this Government was going to go into Queensland and take control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell the Senate that no one is going to take control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland because if they take control over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they will do so over my dead body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But its supporters start talking about taking over control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they have a fight on their hands because we in Queensland are not going to allow anyone to take control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had no knowledge that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were employed in such activities until it was reported to me by the Aboriginal community at Leonora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Did the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on a visit to Leonora late last year, in particular to the offices of the Shire of Leonora, accuse the Shire of misusing funds paid to the Shire for the purpose of a special works project for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I interpret correctly what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  has said, in my opinion what will follow will make this an historic day for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the day is fast approaching when this compensation for dispossession of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders must- I say ‘must’- be channelled to an all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander statutory body empowered to administer such a compensation for dispossession fund, for the survival of fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Aboriginal people- the indigenous people of this nation- will have the opportunity to be represented and to put forward their point of view in relation to what should be preserved in this nation as the national heritage of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister inform the Parliament how many homes were built in the Bamaga group of settlements for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> between 13 December 1975 and 30 November 1976? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that viewed at this particular time when the Aboriginal people had taken it in their own hands to have discussions on this land rights legislation this article is a reasonable record of a meeting that these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had with a reporter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a ) The removal of all powers to pass Land Rights Legislation from Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, particularly its control over sacred sites, entry permits, control over the seas adjoining Aboriginal land, the fishing rights of non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enter pastoral stations and control of wildlife on Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(0 A provision that land-owning groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may apply to form separate trusts if they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the provisions in these sub-clauses showed a paternalistic attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that what the Government is doing on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is repudiating that sacred site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Does this sub-clause mean that Aboriginal people who may wish to make a claim to those areas in fact have no claim at all because the road and not the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have the highest priority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I table a statement by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable Ian Viner, relating to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have a high personal regard for  Dr Kalokerinos,  the honourable senator will understand that my Department must rely upon acceptable scientific evidence as a basis for action to improve the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and contribute to their social and economic advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware of media reports that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will build 50 humpies on tribal land at Llandilo, north of Penrith, to house the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the western suburbs of Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware of a statement by an Aboriginal spokesman,  Mr Don  Williams, that the humpies were being built in absolute desperation and his claim that the Federal Government was asked, in vain, for sums of $170,000 and of $50,000 to build motel-type accommodation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Department of Social Security taken steps to establish a Social Welfare Unit for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the Department; if so, is this Social Welfare Unit to have comparable powers to the Social Welfare Units in the Departments of Health and Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will know of a submission to the Government from the Queensland Homeless Persons Advisory Committee seeking funding for a number of homeless persons projects for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In some areas of Australia there are schemes whereby amounts equivalent to what would be unemployment benefits are paid to the Aboriginal communities and payment is made to individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for work done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards unemployment benefits in general, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are eligible for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, yesterday I heard Government supporters saying that they supported a policy of assimilation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be said that the whole purpose of this legislation is to give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> selfmanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to provide for consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is drafted in such a way that the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in relation to these matters will be taken into account by the Minister in any of the declarations or the decisions which he must make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators,  I  present a report by  Mr N.  M. Butcher on the greater involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the economy of the Pilbara and Kimberley regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government support the abolition of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act (Queensland) 1 97 1 , and the Torres Strait Islanders Act (Queensland) 1971 and take such action as they deem necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Queensland Discriminating Laws Act, 1975 and the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 be enforced in so far as they relate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regularly visited the Territory on many occasions looking at environmental questions and the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Government to have another think about this matter while the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are doing their extra thinking and come up with the right sort of proposition, as the Government promised to do in 1975, instead of the broken promises it has given the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from that day to this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish merely to summarise my view of the episode in Estimates Committee C. Very simply, I felt that  Senator Kilgariff  was inclined to be a wet blanket as far as the expenditure by successive governments in endeavouring to alleviate the plight of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Territory is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that if only 10 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had better eyes and ears, as compared with the vast numbers who have had ailments in other years, it represented an achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke disparagingly of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as being non-employment statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner  said that Galarrwuy Yunupingu has asked him- a senator from the Liberal-National Country Party Government, who as such is a party to the legislation under which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may be suffering at the present time- to attend the meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, I have no knowledge of the matters that are being raised by honourable senators in regard to housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in each of the above categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-51-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give an undertaking that the reductions will not take place and that the Aboriginal Legal Service will be retained as a separate organisation for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-58-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather fascinating for an Aborigine to sit in this chamber and listen to a whole group of so-called white experts speak on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator who is interjecting at the moment would know no more about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than the man in the moon because he is not an Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he stands up in this chamber and spouts off as if he knows everything about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How in the name of God can he stand up here and through a white man’s eyes view and understand the things that mean something to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to distribute my statements widely to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so they can know the full truth of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were told at the time of the signing of the mining agreements that the Government intended to tax their royalties and the extent of that tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many: (a) male; and (b) female <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are enrolled (i) at each University and College of Advanced Education; and (ii) in each faculty at each university or college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In standing up here and pretending that we are concerned about human rights we should not be as concerned about the kind of people who are articulate and who can make flowery speeches as we are about the little guy, the person who cannot battle for himself, such as the helpless, illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have a serious eye disease that might send them blind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 when the Labor Party drafted its Bill for Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory, it said in the attendant publicity that of course it was not incompatible and that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were entitled to their share of their traditional lands and their share of land granted to them on a basis of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite possible that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves will get very little from the royalties, at least for a very long time, and some of the official documents issued by this Federal Government have indicated that it may be a long time before the royalties are there in any quantity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned as to whether there is going to be a payment by the Commonwealth to anyone who is going to oppose <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> getting land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it be considering their rights or their claim for rights as against another group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanting land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking in the Senate on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill on 23rd September of this year 1 recited information I had  received of bad treatment to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Yuendumu settlement, Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the allegations I made was that six male <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were directed with the approval of the Superintendent to round up three girls and, as a punishment for an offence, take them out bush to be continually raped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said:  1 have caused further enquiries to be made in the light of this more specific information and 1 enclose a copy of a statement from thirteen <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are councillors or former councillors at Yuendumu. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said:  ‘Mr Nichols  is able and willing to take part in general social work with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and is capable of supervising European staff.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President of Yuendumu Village Elders Council, Tim  Jabanardi  said many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Yuendumu did not want Nichols to leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948-66, all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are British subjects and Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the commencement of the Social Welfare Ordinance 1964 in September 1964, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory have been equal at law with all other residents, although some special benefits have been retained for them or have been introduced since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is even worse in the regulations under the Act, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and Torres Strait Islanders Regulations of 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister went further when he was making his statement about the Wingellina nickel site and said:  lt was difficult to delineate the areas to satisfy the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the mining company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Council sought and was refused a hearing by the Commonwealth Minister on that dale, will the Minister agree that in all future discussions of this nature white men alone be not allowed to make decisions and that a majority of Aboriginals and Islanders be included in such conferences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the opinion of those responsible for circulating this petition that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders’ Affairs Act 1965 oppresses the Aboriginals of Queensland and that it is a denial of human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic philosophy of this act seems to be that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> it covers must be closely  controlled by the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs (hereafter referred to as the department). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves have grown up believing that they had no rights at all and that they must always obey the white staff on the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1965 act differentiates between those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be assisted and those not requiring aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is also notable that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> refer to the ‘unassisted’ as ‘free men’ and talk about getting their freedom when making application for exemptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the statement made in the House of Representatives on 3rd September 1970 relating to Aboriginal land rights be withdrawn, since it can only be described as Government pressure on the Northern Territory Supreme Court; if not, will he undertake to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to obtain land in the same way as tribal lands were seized from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the first place, that is, by making it legal for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to use force in their struggle to obtain land rights and in the same way as previous Governments made it legal for white men to use force to obtain land owned by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for  the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts been drawn to reports of a study made by the Chemistry Department of the University of Tasmania concerning pollution of marine life by metals, which suggests that mercury levels in sea food in some Australian waters are already much higher than is desirable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today find themselves drifting between 2 worlds, accepting

          retaining to some extent the intricate pattern of relationship, the wonderful gift of

          departments and organisations working in the field today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obligingly, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live up to that
            expectation in every part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor D. W. McElwain, whose research into the cognitive ability or
          intelligence of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland is well known, has concluded as a result of a
          study of 1,000 subjects: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no inborn or genetic limitations on the basic intelligence of
            <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be regretted that artifacts
          which have been identified with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should now be mass produced overseas and
          imported into Australia at such prices and in such quantities that the indigenous
          manufacture of such artifacts as boomerangs is no longer economically feasible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people who are most maligned and who get the least assistance in Australia are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not be derogatory about the current Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  but probably the first time he saw more than 10 black people together was when he visited a Queensland reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts seen  a report from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries stating that Queensland’s kangaroo population was healthy and flourishing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  took part on the radio programme ‘A.M.’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by the new Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  quoted by  Senator Georges  a few moments ago is something else that causes me some concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the new Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts will also be making further opportunities available for research in matters of an environmental nature which directly concern us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber wholeheartedly endorse his plea for a better deal for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not alone in my thinking when I say that  Senator Bonner  will have many disillusionments when he tries to persuade this Government to change its attitudes to the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another maiden policy speech last night,  Senator Bonner,  an Aboriginal, made an eloquent appeal for Australia’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government has dedicated itself to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia has played a significant pioneering role in the field of legislation to assist the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a positive fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Act apply not simply to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also to any group or individual who might be discriminated against, but it has had particular importance with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, under this legislation the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> goes beyond the mere negative removal of specific legislative discriminations and deals positively with the informal discrimination which had previously operated under social rather than statutory sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another landmark in legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which can be claimed by South Australia is the Aboriginal Land Trust Act 1966, under which land which had been reserved for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but which had remained Crown land, was transferred to an Aboriginal Land Trust, made up of Aboriginal members, with the ownership of the land being vested in the Trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The social services system has not been implemented properly in another extensive field, namely, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my travels in my own State and in other areas I have come across many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are entitled to age pensions but who are illiterate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case histories in my office show clearly that, had it not been for our intervention or the intervention of Aboriginal organisations and people who are prepared to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, thousands of them would not be receiving an invalid pension or an age pension because their skins are black. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Health: ls it a fact that since the Western Australian Government ceased to make a lump sum payment to the Western Australian Branch of the Australian Medical Association, which helps to provide medical treatment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the south west of Western Australia, these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been left with only the subsidised medical scheme of the Commonwealth Government to help them meet the cost of medical treatment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls  it a fact that of the 6,000 or 7,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in the south-west of Western Australia no more than 1,000 are covered by the subsidised medical scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have invitations been extended to mining interests generally for the mining of bauxite in the Arnhem Land reserve at Marchinbar Island when the Prime Minister announced on 6th May 1971 that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be given reasonable preference in mining prospecting and exploration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it not have been more in keeping with policy to have offered the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Elcho Island and Yirrkala, some of whom were born on Marchinbar Island and consider it clan territory, the first opportunity to form a company to develop the bauxite mining? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember on one occasion we were arranging housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 8th April 1971 the Prime Minister and tha Queensland Premier issued a joint statement concerning the agreement reached on alteration of the Queensland legislation applying to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 1 6th September  Senator Murphy  asked me a question without notice about a letter from the Australian Mass Communications Council to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts concerning the proposed National Film and Television School. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a grand opportunity for the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to come in with all guns blazing and co-opt the various authorities that arbitrate on this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Like everyone else in this chamber I have been inundating the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts with all sorts of matters, ranging from limestone to many other things, in respect of which I wanted him to instigate effective planning, utilising the Bureau of Mineral Resources to assess various alternative deposits - in fact the whole range of variations of environmental control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts continues to adopt a Pontius Pilate attitude it does not say much for the research that  Senator Davidson, Senator Rae  and other people who served on the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution engaged in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the fairly pervading influence of the Commonwealth Department of Health, and in a position yet to be evolved in these areas there is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the notorious incidence of air pollution in Los Angeles and Chicago, regarded as amongst the worst in any part of the world, will the Minister make urgent representations to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts for immediate consultation with the New South Wales Government to enable such research and action lo be taken as may ensure to Sydney, or in like manner to all of our capital cities, an avoidance of the American cities’ dire experience in’ respect of air quality? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware also that the former Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  before the 1969 election, promised that all discriminatory laws against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be abolished in the life of the present Parliament, and that the then Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effectiveness of policy in relation to the arts will depend in part on the vitality and wisdom of the institutions set up to administer it In the Commonwealth, overall responsibility for the arts has been placed by me with the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the South-West of Western Australia receive only Commonwealth Government assistance with regard to medical expenses since the Western Australian Government ceased the payment of a lump sum amount to the Western Australian Branch of the Australian Medical Association, which previously helped to provide medical treatment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the South-West of Western Australia who have availed themselves of assistance under the Plan is not known because no distinction is made between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the introduction of the Plan, State authorities and private doctors assumed some responsibility for the cost associated with providing medical care for low income groups and in particular <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Correspondence between my Department and the Western Australian Branch of the Australian Medical Association was concerned with proposals put forward by the Association to assist wilh the payment of doctors for services rendered to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Victoria River Downs Station in the Northern Territory still living under appalling conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister undertake to have an immediate and urgent inquiry made into living and working conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Victoria River Downs Station? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) There arc about 90 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living permanently on Victoria River Downs Station which is owned by the Hooker Pastoral Company Pty Ltd. Only a small number of these people are employed by the Company on a regular basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In common with many other areas the living conditions of unemployed and pensioner <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> residing on the property are unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Government has appointed a Committee to examine and report on the situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on pastoral properties to see what steps might be taken to improve the social and economic situation of various groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 also asked company representatives about the effect on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has another reference before it dealing with the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Committee is not clear about what time would be required, the reference in relation to discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders certainly would be all the Committee could cope with within this series of sittings, so it would not be ready for any other references before we returned in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and MinisterinCharge of Tourist Activities inform the Parliament why his Government recognises - even if only partially - land rights for some persons in Papua New Guinea but consistently refuses the same recognition of tribal land rights to Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts ascertain whether the Australian Film Development Corporation has invested in an Australian feature film called ‘Stockade’ on the basis of a return of  I2i  per cent of all profits made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meet  the special housing needs of (a) low income earners, (b) pensioners, (c) migrants, (d) <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and (e) deserted wives and similarly disadvantaged people; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Government accepts its responsibilities to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, of course, to deserted wives and other disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to pensioners, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, deserted wives, and similarly disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has power to legislate for the assistance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, lt was granted that power by a referendum of the people of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not need assistance and do not want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in the category of low income earners (hey should be considered on their merits and in no way associated with their racial background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> happen to be a little better off than the low income group  they  should not be included in a special category just because they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as such are as much a Commonwealth responsibility as are members of the armed Services, pensioners or migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not start impregnating legislation of this type with endeavours to deal with special problems such as we have with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be solved only as a separate problem.It will not be solved by patching up all sorts of legislation to provide special concessions or advantages in relation to housing or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should come under the Commonwealth’s own authority and be accepted as a Commonwealth responsibility in line with the opinion expressed by referendum by the people of Australia when it was decided that these people who are disadvantaged because of their association with their old tribal customs and all that flows from them should be looked after adequately by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not be introduced into special legislation relating to homes savings grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope the British Government takes note of what we have been saying, lt is also out of order to mention in this amendment the special housing needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in existence a scheme which assists <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the field of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that scheme $25m will be provided to the States over 5 years for the building of housing units for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far $ 14.5m has been spent for this purpose in building 2,000 units for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been assisted by a grant which has been made by the Commonwealth Government to the Stales to the extent of $14.5m for the building of 2,000 units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pensioners, (c) migrants, (d) <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and (e) deserted wives and-  for the glory of the excitement and so that no elector shall be left out of the net of allurement-  similarly disadvantaged people; and (2) acquire existing’’ dwellings for restoration’ and allocation by rental or sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the part of the amendment that deals with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2m for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were to be worked out on a per capita basis for the rest of the population it would show a great advantage per capita to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over the remainder of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2m to provide 430 houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this year is not a disregard of their requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really an impertinence to the Senate to bring this amendment forward, suggesting as an appendage to a generous allocation for general housing purposes a categorisation of this sort, specifying <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and aged persons and not even noticing the significant appropriations made under recently innovated Government policy in each of those special fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts aware that an atempt to ask questions about the living conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed by the Hooker Corporation at Victoria River Downs Station was rejected at the annual meeting yesterday of Hooker Corporation Ltd? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Government view the fact that when Pastor Frank Roberts, representing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, asked for more detail in the answers, he was abruptly silenced by  Mr Hooker  who old him that the meeting would not be turned into a debating forum on the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Government consider this kind of behaviour by a wealthy land tycoon to be of any assistance in maintaining good relations wi h the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially in connection with their claims to land rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concern of the Government is  we))  expressed by the many steps which it has taken to improve the position of the Aboriginal population and to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in accordance with Government policy, to have opportunities for development in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made a request that as S208.700 was appropriated for the Legal Services Bureau, as S73.200 was appropriated for the payment of legal aid in special circumstances and as $466,400 was appropriated by way of grants to approved marriage guidance organisations would ihe Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  consider an extension of legal aid to cover pensioners and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pressed the matter further and asked the Attorney-General whether there were any possibility of his Department giving some consideration to extending legal aid lo people in necessitous circumstances such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impetus for its foundation did not come from white people or from a desire to implement abstract principles but from a group of articulate young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reacting to the day to day pressures which they felt operated in their own lives and in the lives of other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially they felt a desire to fight back against what they experienced as an alien apparatus of law enforcement which bore oppressively on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and did not operate to protect them or accord them rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had at its inquiry desk <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were seeking legal aid approached other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were considerate of their requests and forwarded them onto the committee of management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following my question to the Attorney-General at the Estimates Committee hearing I was pursuing the point that there should be an extension of the legal service for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, which is the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They explained that where they have to go along to the established legal aid set-up there is some embarrassment felt on their part because they are interviewed by whites and they would rather be interviewed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier to the fact that this inflexible policy is shown most of all amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have’ our own coloured people to look after - the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that to hear  Senator Keeffe  speak about the turmoil and the recent demonstrations by some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and applauding them, is not the way- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could help Australia by training a few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as shearers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that simplified application procedures being arranged by my colleague, the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  will make the benefits of the subsidised medical scheme more readily available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding past and present efforts the health status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> remains a cause for concern particularly in respect of infant mortality and malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond the statutory school leaving age, we are very encouraged by the response to the secondary and study grants schemes, which, as honourable senators will be aware, help make it possible for young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to pursue their studies as far as they are capable of proceeding with substantial benefit to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that very many more young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are now staying on in secondary school and that there has been generally a marked improvement in the attitudes and application of the children and in their level of attainment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By investing sufficient money in the right areas over the years immediately ahead we will be making it possible for increasing numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become independent of the special assistance now being provided through the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account and in other ways, and, where they need assistance, to be progressively cared for by the general provisions made for the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after that the present Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  was allotted that portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that his portfolio is that of Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities, but there appears to be nothing relating to tourist activities in the heading set out in the Particulars of Proposed Expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What are the facts about the environment within the sphere of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Ihe Arts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administrative step of establishing the Office of the Environment within the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has been taken by the Commonwealth, but this Office appears at the time of the preparation of this report to have done little more than play the part of a liaison agency without developing the operative co-ordinating role in Federal action that seems desirable to focus the Commonwealth’s multifarious interests in spheres of activity bearing on environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland referred to some of the dialogue which ensued between members of Senate Estimates Committee B and the officers of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortified by that assurance I waited for the honourable Peter Howson, who is Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, to get cracking in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have been  Senator Greenwood,  deputising for the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, who supplied the answer I have in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appreciate that it has overtones for the Western Australian Government, but it is clear that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has no ammunition to enable him to play a valuable role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and I feel I ought to make some response at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did  Mr Townsend,  the  Deputy  Secretary of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and ihe Arts, say to Senate Estimates Committee B when he appeared before it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>because 1 know something of the efforts he was under taking, that a very real impetus to the development of that council was given by the present Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  lt is proposed that through this council effective consultation and coordination between the Commonwealth and State Governments will be achieved on appropriate environment matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administrative step of establishing the Office of the Environment within the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has been taken by the Commonwealth, but this Office appears at  the  time of the preparation of this report to have done little more than play the part of a liaison agency without developing the operative co-ordinating role in Federal action that seems desirable to focus the Commonwealth’s multifarious interests in spheres of activity bearing on environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been ample opportunity, notwithstanding anything which has been said by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood),  as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  for this Government despite any constitutional problems which may exist to have taken action and to have shown an awareness of the problem and a keenness to take steps to overcome the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some 14 months after the announcement, all that can be said by the officer who represented the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts before Estimates Committee B is that’one and a bit’ officers have been appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is probably quite wise to draw attention to the content of the report of the Senate Estimates Committee  B  in which, in referring to the Department  of  the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, there are references to what the Committee called on that occasion it considerable degree of confusion, a lack of information, and slow progress in reaching establishment in certain areas, particularly the section dealing with the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  as well as of the officers who were with him that there were references within the departmental estimates to a considerable number of officers within that Department such as those involved with Aboriginal affairs, the arts and various other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Office of the Environment within the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts does not go down as the Department that is credited with one and a bit officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what bas been done by the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The substantial part of the period from June to November was taken up by the Public Service Board and the Department of the Treasury - not the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts - in dealing with the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament wants to change that system, let it change it; but 1 believe that, on the inadequate information which was available to the Estimates Committee which looked at this matter, there was no warrant for saying that the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts was responsible for slow progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only person who has spoken in support of the Government’s contention on this matter throughout the whole of the debate has been the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  who represents the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister seems concerned that as a result of the digging and probing which went on at the Estimates Committee hearing certain facts were elicited.I again remind the Minister that on page 29 of the document entitled ‘Particulars of Proposed Expenditure for the Services of the Year ended 30th June 1972’, under the heading Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts’, we find the following divisions listed: Administrative Assistance for the Arts, Commonwealth Archives Office, Australian Government Publishing Service, Australian War Memorial, Office of Aboriginal Affairs, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and National Library of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one finds those divisions listed in the appropriations for the Government for the year, the ministerial portfolio is the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, and no mention is made of the Environment section of that Department, what does the Government expect? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was when the portfolio of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts is a newly established Department and obviously some reasonable time is necessary to obtain full efficiency, the Committee, in its examination of the Estimates of the Department, found that there was a considerable degree of confusion, lack of information and ‘slow progress in reaching establishment in certain areas.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The camp at Marrylli out from Katherine is in contrast with the Warrabri camp in that it has 3 different stages of housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one section for those who follow the tribal custom of living out in the bush in shacks, a second section composed of those who have graduated to a better class one-room brick house, and then a further section composed of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been educated and trained to a standard which enables them to occupy cottages which would compare with reasonable constructions in city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department also gives special attention to the needs of older workers and it applies special measures to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over a lengthy period the Opposition has contended that the maximum is not being done by the Government to alleviate the problems associated with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Office of Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister might be able to examine the possibility of giving sufficient, by way of a grant or repayable bridging loan, to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to purchase their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know from personal experience that, because of a lack of education and training, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are facing many problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are competent, know the problems of their own people and will work, they can be of great assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how much money we pour into this area or how we legislate, unless the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are able to help themselves all our efforts will be in vain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has made some suggestions of which I am sure the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  will take account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government does not identify Public Servants and Crown employees by race and there is no record to indicate whether officials are white or non-white, but purely from some personal knowledge it is known that some Torres Strait Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are within the Public Service/Crown employees Staff establishment at Bamaga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have invitations been extended to mining interests, generally, for the mining of bauxite in the Arnhem Land Reserve at Manchester Island, in view of the Prime Minister’s announcement on 6th May 1971 that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be given reasonable preference in regard to mineral prospecting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it have been more in keeping with the Government’s policy to offer the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Elcho Island and Yirrkala, some of whom were born on Manchester Island and consider it their clan territory, the first opportunity to form a company to develop the bauxite deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A document issued with the press announcement of 12th September 1971 on the subject indicated that a particular consideration in assessing the suitability of applicants would be an applicant’s preparedness to respect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the island and a willingness to provide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with tangible economic benefits from mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts whether it is a fact that the infant mortality rate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is 6 times higher than the rate for other Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator’s question from information received from the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that statement, the Prime Minister dealt with the Government’s overall policy for Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and its specific policy on land and gave a summary of the Commonwealth’s achievements in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now I would like lo inform the Senate of the Government’s intentions for the advancement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and explain the implications of our present policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek in this that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will achieve effective and respected places in a single Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a right to decide for themselves at what pace and to what extent they come to identify themselves with that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thought of separate development of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a long-term aim is completely alien to the Government’s objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainly, these decisions are concerned with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, because it is a vast area of Australia in which the Common-  wealth has direct responsibility for the development of the  22,000  Aboriginal Australians there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me deal firstly with the decisions that have been made for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who’ wish to continue substantially to follow their traditional way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that there shall be no doubt whatsoever, the Government has decided to provide explicitly in legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have effective access for hunting and foraging on reserves and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the opinion of the Government, these 4 new decisions make it clear that everything is being done to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to continue their present way of life to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible under these proposals for a community or group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to obtain a SO-year lease of land at a nominal rent  Ibr a  variety of purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  said in his second reading speech on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill last October, governments throughout Australia are spending some $44m this year on behalf of 140,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, in addition, as Australian citizens, they also receive social services and other similar benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also several reports are being prepared by expert committees on special problems which affect the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the north and will give valuable guidance to those concerned with Aboriginal development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that impressed the Minister greatly during his recent trip to the reserves in the western part of the Northern Territory was that there are no longer any nomadic <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that part of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Port Keats mission community, the Minister saw <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> engaged in making bricks, sawing timber and erecting their own homes; in fact, entering into a new way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Yuendumu, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have made remarkable progress; they have their own modern community hall, a community store and various worthwhile enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister believe that this insult to Miss Goolagong and Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is reprehensible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a meeting of the chairmen of agencies which advise the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  on support for the arts, it was agreed that our programmes should have the following broad aims: The promotion of a standard of excellence over the whole field of the arts; the widening of access to and understanding and appreciation of the arts in the community generally; the expression of an Australian identity through the arts; and the presentation of Australia’s cultural achievements abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts expects the committee to begin its inquiries immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood),  on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However minor the action which is starting to come out of the Ministry of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, let us welcome it, because so little has happened and so little is likely to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I am fed up with the discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders throughout Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 agree that there is a tape recording in existence which has on it the names of several <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and 2 or 3 white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is one of the blights on the conscience of Australians in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this appeal to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  at the Commonwealth level and ask him to conduct a searching inquiry into the Queensland Department and the conduct of all senior people who come under the control of the Queensland Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask that this also be referred to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, lt is not the first time there has been discrimination in Townsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially  Senator Keeffe  raised one matter regarding the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in the context that it was either an injustice or a matter of discrimination.I do not know the full details of the matter he raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AllI will say is that I will convey to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  whom I represent, the matter that he raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is one of the problems which we face in these issues of alleged discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer what  Senator Keeffe  said to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts so that he can examine the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts aware of the project known as ‘Operation Earth Day 72’  -  an imaginative undertaking launched yesterday by a number of organisations and aimed at concentrating public attention upon the need for balanced development and conservation of the environment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> arid the Arts has been drawn to this matter, I am unable to say; but I am quite sure that he will be interested in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister say whether there is any substance in his prophesy that in time this policy would jeopardise the jobs of Australian born people and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the entry of 27,000 non-European migrants in each future year would prejudice the jobs of Australians, including <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is something which one cannot really say in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that 2 representatives of the 2 Australian companies to which I have referred recently saw the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I already have spoken to the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  about this, both in his capacity as AttorneyGeneral and as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his address to the Senate,  Senator Keeffe  also made some very strong statements concerning the Queensland Government and its treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us go back to look at the Labor Party’s attitude towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 19SS during its term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, I as an Aborigine, and as many other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, were referred to as niggers by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember living in Queensland when many people referred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as niggers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the time in Queensland under that regime when I was working on cattle stations and I had to eat my meals at the woodheap, when cattle station owners treated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with a stirrup iron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find lt quite humorous that various members of the Australian Labor Party say they will do so much for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, I have seen the Labor Party policy in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one of his statements, he gave his way to treat the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today and to overcome a lot of the problems that we face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Everingham  sits in the other place, and his policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland and for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia is that they should all be sterilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the Labor Party is just a little bit afraid that perhaps the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might one day build up to such a stage that they will be too many in number for the Labor Party to be able to control and use for political purposes, such as they are using today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel quite sure in my own mind that I as an Aborigine could well fill all the galleries of this Parliament with young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and not so young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if I were inclined to use <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for political purposes as I find the honourable senator from Queensland apparently is doing today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the honourable senator who was making such claims about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland remembers a particular case in that State in which he was going to show the Queensland Government, the Director and the administration on Palm Island exactly how to handle <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said to the administration on Palm Island: ‘You people do not know how to handle <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well,  Senator Webster,  we know your general attitudes towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who refer to  Senator Bonner  as the Uncle Tom of his race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have known occasions - and this was not so many years ago and I am sure the honourable senator will remember - when he made public statements that the housing situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland was quite satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to repudiate what they have said or they have to go quietly on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator made a brief reference concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before the rising of the last Parliament It was one of the shortest speeches he has ever made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question was given to him to ask in this chamber by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a few days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have now been given the question to ask on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who want to know what their rights are in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is one of the great tragedies of life that a man who has been appointed to this Senate, as is the case with  Senator Bonner,  to defend the rights of his people now demonstrates that the only speech that he can make in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is one that attacks somebody who is aligned with the Aboriginal cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy is not to grant sufficient cash to see that the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are improved; it is not to see that the infant mortality rate is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The infant mortality rate of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country is higher than the infant mortality rate of any other coloured race anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner knows and I know of a question that I asked here a few weeks ago concerning the number of homes, occupied by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders, connected to the septic system on Palm Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This argument on Aboriginal rights will go on in this Parliament whilever this Government is in power because it is only the Australian Labor Party which has a reasonable policy and which can implement it in a reasonable way to give to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the status of human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until 1967, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not counted as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  made some attempt to remove or to persuade the Queensland Government to remove its discriminatory laws against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somebody on this side of the Senate has to stick up for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and I am proud to be able to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that there are many fine people in that Department, but I want to see all those people whom I have mentioned sacked and disposed of because of the inhuman way they have acted towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been herded onto reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator is happy with that situation I should like him to know that there are at least 29,000 other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland who are not happy with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that this matter has been raised in such a way as to indicate to many people that there may be disagreement among the people of Australia on the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be regarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further point is that  Senator Bonner  suggested that we were turning the lives of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the world should not be informed maliciously and falsely that a man of his standing in the community plays <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> off as political issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I know of noone in Queensland who has done more for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than has  Dr Everingham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner has referred to the fact that  Dr Everingham  is alleged to have said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be sterilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to be accused of that, then I suggest to  Senator Bonner  that he go to his ex-Prime Minister and tell him that he, the ex-Prime Minister, was trying to make the lives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a political issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was  Mr Gorton  who said that unless the Queensland Government removed from its statute book some of the discriminatory laws against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he, as Prime Minister, would be forced to come into the issue and see that those discriminatory provisions were removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to be accused of making a political issue when we stand up in defence of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, then I say that the ex-Prime Minister has also to be accused because what he has said is on record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anybody in this chamber tonight had done as much to advance the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - particularly those of Queensland - as had  Senator Keeffe  and  Dr Everingham,  then the lives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this Commonwealth would be much better than they are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall also direct the attention of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  whom I represent, to the matter to see whether anything can be done on  a  basis which acknowledges the rights of people to move to better jobs and, at the same time, to avail themselves of opportunities to establish businesses in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that when  Senator Keeffe  walked into the Senate the public gallery was full of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, half castes or people of some degree of colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Keeffe  left the chamber and when the AttorneyGeneral rose to speak the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> left the gallery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the man who is representing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be remiss in my responsibility if I did not congratulate  Senator Keeffe  on his great defence of coloured Australians, when compared with the attack made on him by one of their race in defence of the white man’s treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose was to discredit the Labor Party’s treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to suggest that he was doing more for them and their protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly  Senator Keeffe  did not reply to the particular question, but in no uncertain terms he left noone unconvinced that he was championing the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the causes of that outbreak is the fact that 27 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living in 2 rooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister  representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts investigate an allegation of cruelty on the Yarrabah Reserve as it has been stated that a male resident had his hands handcuffed behind bis back and was then assaulted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he taken into consideration the fact that large numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and many species of wildlife inhabit the many remote areas of Australia and that they would be seriously affected by the sonic boom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances did he discuss the likely injurious effects to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the environment with the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts before he made his decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Government consistently refuse the same recognition of tribal land rights to Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders that it gives to some persons in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite the honourable senator’s attention to the Prime Minister’s statement of 26th January which was tabled in the Senate on 23rd February: Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, Commonwealth Policy and Achievements’, and in particular to the sections on land policy set out on pages 9 and 10. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now occupying some of their own land in front of Parliament House have conducted their land rights campaign with great dignity and credit to their people, will the Minister persuade the Government to make available to them a suitable building in Canberra which will serve as a headquarters for the ‘Embassy’ and the Aborigine and Torres Strait Islander campaigners for land righto and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that a census taker is alleged to have informed Councillor S.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Health been drawn to an article appearing in the ‘Age’ of 5 th April 1972 directed to the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders which states that venereal disease is widespread among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can he assure the Senate that his Department will investigate this claim to ensure that my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory will be given every medical help in this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Senate on 8th March 1972  Senator Kane  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, the following questions: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has furnished the following replies: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, what steps, if any, have been taken to enrol several thousand <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory so that they may participat . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that at that meeting a number of accusations of ill treatment and neglect were made in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that  Senator Bonner,  who is the State  President  of this organisation, has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the honourable senator will explain to us why  Mrs Wilding,  one of the best known workers for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the last  2  decades in Queensland, was dismissed or forced to resign - whichever the case may be - as matron of the biggest establishment that OPAL has in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that the last Senate election in Queensland indicated that I had the support of a very great group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had voting facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that a moment ago I said that the Premier of Queensland was complaining that the Labor Party was demanding preferential housing treatment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments and, more particularly, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their supporters, have tended to justify favourable discrimination on the general grounds that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have suffered adverse discrimination and deprivation for so long that a few years of favourable discrimination is the least they can expect, and that it is only by such measures that the glaring inequalities between the standard of living of the average Aboriginal and the average non-Aboriginal can ever be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poverty knows no colour bar and there are, no doubt, many non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are in need of financial assistance for housing, education and health services as are the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not enough to keep up with the normal population increase in Queensland, a State which has 50,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on settlements in Queensland are living in abject poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is touchy on the subject of the dereliction of duty to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we ought to recognise that, throughout this country, Commonwealth and State Governments are currently spending at the rate of $44m a year on various ways and means of improving the lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not certain of the facts in regard to this matter or of whether the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts is the appropriate Minister to whom the question should be directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Commonwealth committee is the National Radiation Advisory Committee (NRAC) which reports to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and advises the Commonwealth Government on matters concerning the effects of ionising radiation, whatever its origin, on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister Inform the Senate, firstly, whose responsibility it is to register <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as unemployed; secondly, what facilities are available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for this purpose in remote areas, and thirdly, whether provision is made or could be made for welfare officers or social workers to act as agents for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to see that they are recorded with the Department as unemployed, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been reported to me that in the area in which such liquor is being sold to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there is temporary blindness among some of the youngsters and many of them suffer from tummy pains - and the publican concerned goes on making a fortune. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become clear that in order to lower the levels of infant and child morbidity and mortality among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory it is necessary to have an improvement in the general socio-economic status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 9th March 1972  Senator Rae  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, what progress had been made in bringing the staff of the Office of the Environment Division up to establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has now advised me that the approved staff establishment of the Office of the Environment Division is: 1 - First Assistant Secretary, Level 3 1- Clerk, Class 8 2- Clerk, Class 6 1- Clerk, Class 4 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is for a group of people, including <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and supporters of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Adelaide, who come to me on occasions for assitance in their fight for equality and better conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This group came to see me last week, concerned at the attempt by certain Ministers of the Crown to hold <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in contempt, as second class citizens with whom no-one likes to be associated, in relation to using them to stop special assistance being given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A. M.

  <li>
    <p>We see the basis for the propaganda that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are inferior people and that noone likes living next to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These statements which I have quoted as being made by  Mr Hodges  come from such a responsible source that what he says would appear to be the policy of the Queensland Government, that is, not to house <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the sake of providing housing for them but to house them for the purpose of the destruction of those who are out to promote their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of only one honourable senator who has been championing the cause of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and who lives in northern Queensland among the Aboriginal people and among supporters of the Aboriginal cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  would be recognised as one of the greatest supporters that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What hypocrisy appears now if this honourable senator, who has been championing the cause of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is trying to sell ‘lis house because  Mr Hodges  is deliberately placing an Aboriginal family next door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I moved for the Committee to inquire into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that this proposed ordinance is not to be directed against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been camped on the lawns in front of Parliament House since 26th January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should imagine that if this ordinance is brought into operation and physical action is taken to evict them we probably will find not the remnants of this group there but perhaps 1,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> converging on Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another inference that might be drawn from the statement made by the Minister concerned is that if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> make application for a lease of the area it is remotely possible that it might be granted to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to the recently announced flight plan across Australia for the inaugural Concorde venture, are we to conclude that the Minister endorses the statement of British Aircraft Corporation publicity manager, Charles Gardner, that in the Australian desert there is nothing except a few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and plenty of kangaroos? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior seen a newspaper report which suggests that only 5 of the 52 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were supposed to have supported a petition opposing a wood chip industry on Melville and Bathurst Islands had in fact done so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the Snake Bay Council - one of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the Territory who visited Eden last month to see the wood chip industry there - and the Superintendent of the settlement interviewed the people whose names appeared on the petition to talk about their objection to the wood chip industry on the islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Health a question about health services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and he said that he would respond to the question today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now restate my question: Are any specific provisions made by the Government to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not deprived of medical services through inability to pay contributions to the health funds, and are the benefits available under the subsidised health benefits plan made widely known to Aboriginals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particular problems have arisen with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially in Western Australia, but action has been taken by my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Social Services, to effect improvement to the arrangements in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the special situation in Western Australia, certain general improvements to the plan introduced by my Department in November 1971, including the introduction of simplified forms of application and entitlements and other procedures, should also facilitate the enrolment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>As you know,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  the Committee of which you are the  Chairman  was looking only recently at some of the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Arnhem Land, although they receive very low incomes, seem to be avid cigarette smokers and purchase large quantities of cigarettes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a substance which is more dangerous to the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than cigarettes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the high infant mortality rate amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Arnhem Land could be traced to an over-indulgence in what is regarded almost as a sacred product in Queensland and what is harmless to the rest of us, that is, sugar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware that at a meeting of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> held in Canberra on Fiday, 11th August, it was resolved to ask for the re-establishment of the black embassy in Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 could speak on this point at great length in order to indicate the futility of providing such Aboriginal reserves if they are not to be put to some use for the future benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has made a statement on the subject; but I should like to see a more recent statement showing what steps have been taken to implement or to adopt, or to adopt with qualifications, the recommendations of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the first amendment is to ensure primarily that the principles which were set forward not only in our deliberations and in the decisions taken by our conference, but in the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Atomic Energy Commission is a subsidiary of the National Development Ministry why was this ministry given inflated committee membership when the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts was excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most States and the Northern Territory retain special legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, providing among other things for the maintenance and management of Aboriginal reserves and the provision of special assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-122-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The activities of the Nutrition section of the Department of Health are currently related to certain nutritional problems in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-129-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The concept of an impact statement’ designed to protect the environment was first outlined in the Senate by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts on 24th May 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not count our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many persons employed by the nonmetropolitan unemployment relief scheme are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the scheme make any special provision for the relief of unemployed amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have nol the figures of the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are assisted by the non-metropolitan unemployment relief scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the scheme makes no discrimination whatever between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other unemployed persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the comparative per capita expen diture on education as between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and others, last year the general per capita- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made very little increase in the allocation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the current financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a programme of orientation to and education about Aboriginal life and culture, including language courses where possible, presented essentially by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for all personnel involved with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw honourable senators’ attention to the Development News Digest’ which sets out in detail many of the problems confronting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today and the manner in which some of the problems can be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But later in the session I shall certainly be talking in detail about a whole range of questions concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Plenty of opportunities to carry out a further post mortem on what the Government proposes to do with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be available before this session terminates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I remember correctly, the figure for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was twice the figure for nonAborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We detribalised the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am almost ashamed to tell the Senate what we did to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at the history of Melbourne to see what we did to the continental <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that a senior New South Wales police officer, Assistant Commissioner Baldwin, stated at a meeting of the New South Wales Aboriginal Advisory Council in Sydney on 14th August that he had been requested by the Commonwealth police to crack down on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to prevent them organising following the removal of the Aboriginal ‘embassy’ in Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he verify or deny a report that in the past 2 weeks or so police  in Sydney have arrested over 40 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for a wide variety of alleged offences under the New South Wales Summary Offences Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he explain why police are exercising surveillance over the homes of certain <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the inner Sydney suburbs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would doubt very much that the Commonwealth police have any part in the matters to which he has referred because it is not the function of the Commonwealth police in any sense to take action in New South Wales with respect to offences against the Summary Offences Act in that State; nor have the Commonwealth police any function to deal specifically with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minis ter for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these serious allegations have been refuted by 2 Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>,  Mr Samuel  McDonald and  Mr Frank  Webb, who have worked for Vesteys and who have many relations living on Vesteys properties, will the Minister have an inquiry made to ascertain how many new homes have been constructed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the last 5 years by Vesteys, what types of homes have been constructed, what has been the cost of each home and how many of these homes have been deliberately burnt down by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has viewed our programme over the years will know that we have tended to emphasise certain stories: censorship, the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and attitudes towards colour, deficiencies of social welfare, dissent and the conflict between civil liberties and the needs of the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to a few parts of the Budget and, in particular, the section which deals with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had occasion in Western Australia to write to the Minister in charge of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State to draw his attention to the fact that it had been stated in the ‘West Australian’ newspaper that 423 Government houses were vacant in various country towns in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to that Minister that he may be able to use some of those vacant houses to house the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are calling out for homes, I will bet you anything you like that there are many such homes in other States which are vacant and costing governments money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could be used, if necessary, to house <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to find out whether they can look after homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the Commonwealth have to grant this money to the States to build homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when there are homes vacant waiting for someone to go into them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, ls it a fact that at 2 recent international conferences Australia managed to record 2 different votes on the same subject of a 10-year moratorium on the commercial killing of whales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts will be very keen to answer it as soon as he can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department under tha control of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  seems to be an organisation that other departments merely put up with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the purpose of this debate I do not think it would be appropriate for me on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to refer to that aspect in detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For months and months and months the Opposition has been saying that we ought to do more for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am proud of the vision of people like the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who has been a frontiersman in the understanding of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country, in attempting to preserve their traditions, in attempting to get the people of Australia to understand them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday of this week, I was asked a question by  Senator O’Byrne  about a supposed request by the Commonwealth Police to a senior officer of the New South Wales Police Force to crack down on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne  then went on to ask me a number of other questions about actions which police are supposed to have taken with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth Police Force is concerned, there have been no arrests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the past few weeks in New South Wales nor has the Commonwealth Police Force been ‘exercising surveillance’ over the homes of certain <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the inner suburbs of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the AttorneyGeneral now been advised that  Mr Johnny  Golden Brown, an Aboriginal, won his case before the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory concerning the ordinance removing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the precincts of Parlia ment House and that the judgment was that this ordinance never took effect? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Capital Territory: Is it not correct that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other persons outside Parliament House were arrested by the police and were removed from outside this building by the police under colour of the amendments to the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General state plainly to the Senate that that is the position and that it was for some other reason, not that which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were told was the basis on which they were arrested, that they were being dealt with, that in fact it was a huge bungle- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are at present re-erecting their embassy on the lawns outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special circumstances also pertain to the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and the Government proposes to meet this special need by increasing the level of subsidy to those employers who participate in a work training scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that this table does not include indigenous children - <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it refers purely to white children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister take urgent steps to trace the source of that mercury with  a  view to invoking the principle supported by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, that the polluter must pay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he does not plug them there is a chance that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might set up a tent embassy in the corridors outside his office in Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question as to whether it was legal for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to camp in their tents on the lawn is, as I understand it from the judgment, irrelevant, anyhow, because as I understand the judgment - I ask the lawyers to correct me if I am wrong - the judges ruled that the Commonwealth, being the owners of the land, had a continuous and full right to remove people from that land under the common law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion this whole situation has been brought about by the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> put an embassy on the lawns in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of the ‘embassy’ in front of Parliament House began on 26th January of this year, the day on which the Prime Minister said that he would bring down so-called enlightened legislation on the land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted, and it was not what every fair thinking Australian wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had been forecast beforehand that the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt),  who merely takes his orders from the Prime Minister, anyway, would wait until the Parliament was no longer in session before making any move to implement an ordinance to shift the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the embassy’ in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were causing problems to no-one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the only vocal member on the Government side in this House who objected and tried to have the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> removed was the gentleman who was sitting in the chair before you occupied it,  Mr Acting Deputy President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that was not to be; the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not to be left to make a peaceful demonstration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the first opportunity, when members of the Opposition were scattered far and wide around Australia, on 2 occasions large numbers of police were brought in to remove the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that a member of this chamber - I refer to the Independent senator from Western Australia - said that it would not be of much use to give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a copy of the ‘Gazette’ because they would not be able to read it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land rights issue is a very major one for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is relevant to the Bill because it deals with the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the very rights for which these people were fighting in occupying land in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accused us of being liars in actual fact  But  the point I wanted to make is this: That the Commonwealth has got power to move in and override the State, and ‘I think this ought to be  borne  in mind when we are talking about land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> represent less than 1 per cent of the total population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the new legislation will be .looked after better than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in any other State with the possible exception of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question to do with the Aboriginal embassy or whether the rights of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being infringed in some way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If senators opposite are entitled to use the argument that action which is taken by senators on this side is for the purpose of protecting their friends - whether it is the moving of an amendment or the suppressing of a report by the  chairman  of a committee - we are entitled to use the same analogy and to say that a report of a committee is being suppressed by a senator for the reason which he has alleged that amendments have been moved by Opposition senators - to protect the persons whom they represent, whether they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister read of the reported statement by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, when opening a tourist convention, in which he called for lower air fares within Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Government and its law enforcement agencies which had no difficulty in throwing a few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> off the lawns - a problem which is well out of its reach - finds itself completely balked by the problem of solving  this much more important matter which involves threats to the lives and property of Australians and of people who have taken refuge in this country, people who have come to this country believing that it will be safe, and the representatives in this country of a sovereign state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I refer to the emotional issues which involve justice to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to protest effectively by using the area in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Keeffe,  who will be the next  speaker  from this side of the House in the debate, is more competent than I to talk on the emotional issue, because he has had a long-standing interest in the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and he will put a case on that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this issue, let me just say that on Australia Day, 26th January, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> erected a number of tents on the lawns in front of Parliament House for the purpose of protesting against deprivation of Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say that the tents were erected on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were protesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> supported, as  Senator Webster  suggested in his interjection, by many other people consider that they are deprived of land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government waited until 30th June before it made such an Ordinance to remove the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal embassy provided a means by which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could ventilate their protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had become somewhat of a tourist attraction and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had received the sympathy of tourists for the bad deal that had been given to them by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if the Ordinance is disallowed the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or anyone else will have complete freedom to erect a tent on unleased land simply on the basis of the right to organise in the appropriate manner or in a manner which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> think effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that the attitude of the Government in regard to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had no justification at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were taken down without any rectification of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ grievances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I stated, the main question of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be dealt with by  Senator Keeffe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we reject this ordinance today - it then does not become law - the injustice still has been done to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While someone may think that it is ah ordinance involving only the removal of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are camping in front of Parliament House, it goes somewhat further than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of the Government taking action against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it is a question of the Government facing up to its responsibilities of preserving public places in Canberra for public use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the Opposition moving for the disallowance of the Ordinance is to retain a freedom for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party says that, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had a right to demonstrate and my colleague  Senator Cavanagh  pointed out in great detail that they did this with dignity and with honour, not only to the group who were demonstrating but also to their race in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind him that there was no violence and no bashing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when an embassy was removed from the Western Australian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the very basis of the establishment of the embassy on the lawns in front of Parliament House, lt was established there to draw attention to the lack of social rights, to the lack of legal rights and to the lack of the ordinarily accepted human rights which are suffered by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government expects to announce soon the granting of a lease to a company of Gurindji <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for  a  cattle mustering enterprise at Wattie Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lease will be Hie first granted under the decision, announced in June, to make available about 25 square miles for leasing by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Wattie Creek - the final amount could be up to 35 square miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a copy of that telegram which was sent on 26th January 1972, the day on which the protest group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> set up their embassy outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is one of the best spokesmen in this country on behalf of the, downtrodden <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cannot be classified as a person of no moment with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area of protest concerns the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia, particularly the health of Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infant mortality among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in some areas of Australia is 5 times to 10 times and even 12 times that of Australian children of European descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a field in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> asked for help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we move among adult <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we find that in some areas of this country <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with Hansen’s disease are isolated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The island which is occupied by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with Hansen’s disease is Fantome Island which is well off the Queensland coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter about which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> protested very loudly was the restrictive discriminatory anti-black laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation is now divided into 2 Acts, one for the Torres Strait Islanders and the other for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> protested at the embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took about 50 police to remove 7 or 8 peaceful, non-violent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at 1 a.m. on a cold morning with rain falling and wind blowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said: ‘They are not such big brutes that they will come and shift the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before tomorrow morning.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be treated with humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the Australian Country Party are having their own private war about whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right from the start the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> said they did not want to set up there a permanent embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not, in the main, aggressive, although at times and in some circumstances they were driven to assert themselves and did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that today we would all agree that this supposed solution ultimately did not help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to cross the bridges to join us in developing this country, but rather it helped further to destroy them even more widely and insidiously than anything else that could have been designed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  made the relevant point that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been camped outside Parliament House for 6 months and that nothing had been done about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government which is charged with being in some way hostile to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the things they wished to demonstrate, because it had left them there for 6 months before it did anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all aware that the Labor Party supports many causes which it considers equally as valuable as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own Party believes in many other things just as sincerely as it believes in the case for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and which should be given great prominence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, confusion between the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been fringe dwellers of industrial cities for generations, and the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are the true nomad people of sections of northern Queensland, northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory should cease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory have a distinctly different set of problems which are far more difficult to solve than the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have lived in the shadow of industrial cities for generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria the Democratic Labor Party pioneered land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had been segregated into Aboriginal reserves in the Gippsland area to give them back the dignity that they seemed to have lost under the old handout system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 agree wilh  Senator Keeffe  - nobody can disagree now because of the production of the figures - about the infant mortality rate among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if he puts a needle into the little bodies somewhere to give the children the necessary treatment superstition is then introduced and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say that this is what killed the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he is not going to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unless he gets down to cases and investigates those cases by using what intelligence he is blessed with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said at a Democratic Labor Party conference that some of the things that were real culture, which would never die, and which would remain so whatever bridges the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> crossed, were their bark paintings, their carvings and their dancing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Bathurst Island and in various settlements in the Northern Territory I have talked to young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who said that they are walking away from much of this alleged culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a feeling that we as a people want to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and want to do it intelligently and correctly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that there are easy ways out of this problem such as thinking that all we have to do is to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> some land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe has suggested that the Government’s proposition to give 35 square miles of land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Watt <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A station of this size would be needed for a whole tribe of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to establish a viable unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because I would have as much knowledge as, if not more than, most honourable senators in regard to what my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were demonstrating against in front of Parliament House earlier this year until such time as the Ordinance was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to disallow it, the Commonwealth would still have power to move my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> off the lawns in front of Parliament House if they came back there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> set up their tents on the lawns in front of Parliament House they did so to demonstrate against some of the atrocities that have happened to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> since Governor Phillip landed at Botany Bay about 188 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying,  Mr President,  that my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were protesting on the lawns outside Parliament House but they were not protesting wholly and solely against this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Ordinance has become law and, as a law abiding citizen, I stand by it and I hope that my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will stand by it also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to take a great deal of time, but while I am on my feet I want to refer to some of the remarks passed by an honourable senator who purports to support <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made some remarks, when speaking about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which are very offensive to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But why bring the matter up in this place and hold <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> up to ridicule for one’s own political gain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are suffering from what he is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in their own way, always have been very law abiding people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If white people had had to live under the laws of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when living in accordance with their tribal ways, they would have had a tomahawk or a nulla nulla over their heads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much has been said in this debate about my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> protesting on the lawns outside Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just prior to the rising of the Parliament for the last recess I went out on to the lawns outside Parliament House and spoke to my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know from travelling around Australia, and particularly from travelling around my own State, that 90 per Cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my own State, and perhaps throughout Australia, were not in favour of the idea of our young men camping on the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> always have been a very dignified race, particularly until the white man introduced grog and things like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> generally did not agree with our young men camping there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They asked me to come to Canberra and to talk more along the lines of the Government providing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a building in Canberra which they could use for a permanent lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also negotiating with my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the lawns outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They advised my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not to listen to anyone negotiating for a permanent building here.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be continuing that line of action and I will be talking again with the Minister for the Interior and, I hope, with the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  about providing in Canberra a permanent building which can be used by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a permanent lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could then come to Canberra for conferences, discuss matters that they want to discuss and pass resolutions that could be brought before the Government and before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the best way that people can help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is by letting them work out their own problems and by letting them bring their problems to the appropriate people in authority who can do something about them; not by waving banners or walking up and down the streets and shouting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have the political parties of this country not encouraged <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become politically involved and to find their way into Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hear about all the wonderful things that members of the Labor Party are going to do for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that I would have the pleasure of seeing one of my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sitting either on the Government benches or on the Opposition benches - I do not mind which. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like to see encouragement, guidance, training and counselling given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that they can come in here and take their place in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I will be trying, to the best of my ability, to bring about a situation where my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have a permanent lobby in Canberra, I do not feel that at this time I can support the motion to disallow the Ordinance because, as I said earlier, it can do no good for my race whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth still has power to remove <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the lawns in front of Parliament House if they were to set up their tents there again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that 1 was one of those who would or did incite <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to violent action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not at any time take part in any activity or protest on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> here in Canberra or in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be disallowed if only to enable the group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who sought to protest in the way that they did to reerect their tents in front of this place so that there may be a constant reminder to us that something needs to be done in greater depth and that we need a better understanding than  Senator Little  brought to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This year $53 m is to be spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders throughout this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we add all those things we come to $100m at least which will be spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hoping that it will achieve a better end result for the ordinary Aborigine than was achieved last year and that the money will not flow into vested areas, to created positions, to empire building within a department in a way which will absorb the money and which will be of no use to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sign of political adulthood and it shows a maturity within the society when a hunger striker can stay there for as long as he wishes to state his case or when a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may erect some tattered tents and stay there for as long as they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter of wishing to support or not wishing to support the cause, for greater recognition for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the claims of the Aboriginal people on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Labor Party concede to those organisations as well as to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the right to put their shanties, tents, emblems and other things on the lawn outside Parliament House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will, if necessary, link arms and stand between the authorities and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ action in setting up the embassy was not and had never been against the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of our attitude !o <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country has moved from a position of initial hostility and oppression and even cruelty in the early days of Australian settlement through a period to one of paternalism from which we are now resiling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to integrate with our society in the fullest sense of the term, then they must be prepared to integrate, and it is what we should want on the basis of both duty and entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The moment you put the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a different position in relation to respect for law and order, you are immediately demonstrating to them a tolerance which is not accorded to other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want a position of equality to which they are entitled, and integration in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore to those who have suggested that in this form of protest they should be accorded a solicitude and a tolerance which is denied to other sections of the community who similarly want to protest on issues which are relevant to their interests in life, I say that once they do that they are putting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a position different from that of the rest of the community; they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on racial integration, they are contradicting the whole of their thesis on toleration and the whole of their thesis on the ultimate integration of the Aboriginal people with the white culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I say in these last few minutes that those who have supported the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this programme and in this type of protest should have second thoughts about it, to see if by doing that they have not in fact done a great deal of harm to the campaign of these people and to the campaign of the Australian community for the ultimate total absorption of our indigenous people in our culture without any distinctions or differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said that members of the Labor Party who took an active interest in this debate were of the opinion that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had a just cause and that they had protested more vehemently for that cause than they would have for other causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s concern was demonstrated by the fact that some members said they were prepared to link hands and form a barrier between the police and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was evidence of their concern about the treatment that has been accorded to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over a Jong period, a concern which they were prepared to demonstrate in order to impress more people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to speak of the loss of dignity by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and of paternalism, but it is something we must face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  quoted the example of Vesteys being prepared to give land to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet no attempt has been made by this Government to provide land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group of militant <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, even if they are not representative of the whole movement by the Aboriginal people, is not prepared to permit their race to persevere under the conditions of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is whether the Ordinance is a good ordinance, leaving aside the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or whether it ought to be amended or modified as it applies to the ordinary vehicle and to the lands or camping on them or the holding of circuses and festivals on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that there would have been a statement by the Government on its intention to make adequate provision for people to protest, other than the half hour demonstrations that are held from time to time, without it being necessary to do what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have tents, which they call embassies, in other cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has this tendency to treat exservicemen as second class citizens in the same way as it treats pensioners, many of the migrants and the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did Tercon Pty Ltd, the contractors who were awarded a $300,000 contract to widen the Bagot Road (Northern Territory Newsletter, May 1972), give any assurance that provision would be made for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be employed on the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Civil works contracts in the Northern Territory do not contain specific provisions relating to the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are at present only a small number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with suitable work skills available for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>These authorities bring to the attention of contractors and other employers the availability of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for employment and employers generally have co-operated in employing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Health, relates to health services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I present an interim report from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment on the reference relating to the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 main reasons for the presentation of this brief interim report on the reference relating to the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the Committee’s field trips, the members examined sites of significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, by invitation of the particular Aboriginal groups, collections of objects of sacred and cultural significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proposing that action be taken on this aspect of the general subject matter, the Committee wishes to emphasise the need to consult the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned in each instance and to encourage them to seek action for the protection of their objects and sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, however, some of the programmes of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs from the $8.045m available to it, after making the proposed States grants, will benefit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of this amount, $5m will be for the purchase of properties for Aboriginal communities off reserves and $500,000 for grants in association with capital fund loans, as promised by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  in his statement of 26th January, and $2.545m for grants-in-aid for a variety of purposes; and both of these programmes will benefit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly much remains to be done in the health field and the health status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> remains a cause for concern, particularly in respect of infant mortality and malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas in 1969 there might have been no more than 2,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in secondary schools throughout Australia, by 1972 there are of the order of 8,000, of whom 4,266 were training as at June under the secondary grants scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a population percentage basis there should be some 13,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in secondary schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds have been granted to local and other authorities to provide employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on socially valuable projects chosen in accordance with criteria specified by my Office and the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These projects have enabled shire councils in many rural areas to carry out projects of value to their communities while at the same time providing employment and training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the research phase in our crocodile and turtle farming projects has made progress, and  Dr Bustard  has numbers of Torres Strait Islanders and coastal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> engaged in pilot farming projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as honourable senators will already be aware, the whole direction of the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises operated by the Office is to assist suitable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become self-employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing programmes aim primarily to assist families, whose children will benefit thereby: a great deal of health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and children; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for younger <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist schoolleavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it important to bear in mind that the problems facing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in major towns and cities and those of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in communities on reserves, on pastoral properties and on the fringes of remote townships differ very greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The movement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the major cities has been quite striking over the past decade or 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we have placed an increasing emphasis on programmes to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either with the State or unilaterally we have provided hostels and houses, supported the Aboriginal health service in South Sydney, provided funds for schooling, pre-schooling and adult education facilities, assisted <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to find and hold employment, and supported the Aboriginal legal service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has stated that he personally is most impressed by the work being done by the Aboriginal medical service in South Sydney, and believes that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> involved are providing a referral or treatment service to numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Sydney metropolitan area who would not at this stage have the necessary confidence to seek treatment in the first instance from the normal community services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We expect that, as our programmes become more and more effective, the urbanised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will need our assistance less and less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems little doubt that ample employment is available in the cities: What we seek to do is to remove those handicaps inhibiting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from taking full advantage of this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, most of those involved are now living in static communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if almost all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have abandoned their semi-nomadic hunting and gathering life, this does not mean that the old tribal structures and beliefs have also disappeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their members are finding themselves having to cope with a cash economy, to become accustomed to a radically changed diet and to learn aspects of hygiene not previously relevant in their nomadic exsistence I think we should all try to realise that these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote situations are experiencing a difficult period of rapid change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should help them develop appropriate kinds of dwellings, such as the house developed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Finke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we have embarked on a far-reaching programme to delineate areas which are of sacred or special significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we can, through the provision of relevant education, ensure that members of the remote communities become less and less dependent, while at the same time relating that education more directly to the sorts of employment we will be encouraging the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can find additional, different and meaningful employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote communities, we may expect the drift to the cities about which I spoke earlier to accelerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971’ and the ‘Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971’ were introduced to the Queensland Parliament in December 1971 , were assented to on 16 December and presently await proclamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>The Commonwealth Literary Fund is administered by a Committee comprising the Prime Minister  (Chairman), for whom the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts acts, Mr P.

    <p>Surely it comes within the competence of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  as well as the Minister for National Development to act in relation to these matters, and surely these are matters which the Standing Committee on Industry and Trade should examine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think my initial reaction to this measure, and the attitude of all senators, is that a large sum of money is entailed and that we are entitled to feel that there must be a participation by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the spending of the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could pour money into a cattlemen’s co-operative or some other project conducted by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that could fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably there would be an upheaval then about whether some Commonwealth public servant had showed bad judgment, and racists would no doubt argue that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not have the business know-how. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Opposition we have advocated adequate funds being granted to assist the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but we are appreciative of the complexity of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may sound strange coming from me with my trade union background, but although  1  have always believed in seniority for the purpose of protecting people when it came to dismissals, nevertheless we may reach a stage when some of the younger people in the Aboriginal community will have to be given positions of responsibility because some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the older age groups will be too cautious or timid and may not have the drive to meet a situation which the younger ones could manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably it is unfortunate in some respects that this legislation has come before us before  1  and my colleagues  Senator Laucke, Senator Keeffe, Senator Webster  and others have been able to complete our deliberations as members of the Standing Committee on Social Environment which is considering the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reference has been made to the Department of Labour and National Service and there has been some question as to its capacity to handle the urban problem relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a race, I am far from satisfied today that we are geared sufficiently to meet the situation as more and more manual work is phased out and that we are able to provide job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that obviously it is good that because of this Bill <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be able to achieve new skills, but when 1 look at the whole social structure of Australia I come to the conclusion that the Department of Labour and National Service is not so far advanced or so well equipped as it should be to meet the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, let us look at another situation as we are talking about the role of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to asbestos mining there have been some of these small pocket handkerchief mines which people thought were very grandiose in offering work to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even on the job aspect I do nol feel that we should say that we will give these jobs, which white Australians do not want, to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because it keeps them content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many areas in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in great need, particularly in fields to which the Government has seen fit to allocate money such as housing, health, education, employment and, social work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today more assistance is given to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> move into better housing conditions and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen remarkable changes, particularly over the past 6 or 7 years, since the Commonwealth has had power to make special laws for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we add this to what has been allocated by the Federal Government we can see that things are progressing very well for my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in some areas of Queensland criticism has been levelled at the Government because of what is happening and what is being done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very encouraging to me to realise that the Commonwealth Government and my State Government are now becoming more aware of the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that they are now more readily doing something to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time I believe that there is a great need to involve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say this I mean competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not necessarily academically brilliant but <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have suffered the problems which are facing many members of my race at this time and who have been able to overcome these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am not knocking fully qualified social workers but I believe that what is sorely needed is <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have this common communication and who can speak with their own people and assist them to do better in the fields for which the Government is providing finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Bonner  that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not necessarily need academic qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a disadvantage in this respect because so few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have had the opportunity to obtain academic training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland - I will make most of my references to that State - we have a population of something like 60,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders, some 30,000 of whom are still living under what is popularly or unpopularly known as the Dog Collar Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate the substantial provisions made by the Commonwealth since the 1967 referendum the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  prepared a table which he subsequently had incorporated in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders met at Alice Springs from 1st April to 3rd April this year and passed a series of resolutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the words of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as they appear in the resolution- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can understand the attitude of  Senator Webster  when he interjected a moment ago because he expresses the Country Party policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will read the lot because I am not sure where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are included: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One line constitutes the whole of the Country Party’s policy towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that the honourable senator has not come into the Senate and decided to do something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party suggests that the Office of Aboriginal Affairs be upgraded to ministerial level and that the Commonwealth assume the ultimate responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders accorded it by the referendum of 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have equal rights and opportunities with alf other Australians, and every form of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be ended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will receive the standard rate of wages for the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see spreading out in more detail the policy of my Party in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one of the strange things is that under the 1965 Act all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders subject to it were treated in a less than human way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are of different ethnic origin there is always a tendency to look at many subjects not quite eye to eye. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the powers responsible in the Queensland Government decided that they would make this division greater by creating 2 Acts, the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971 and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that they would make life easier for many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither are the other 59,999 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here a letter written by  Mr Joe  McGinness,  President  of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will read portion of it because it signifies precisely what is still happening under the dog collar Act in Queensland in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to bring to your notice  the  allegations against some police officers’ action and attitudes towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who happen to be resident of the different areas around the districts adjacent to Cairns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reports reaching us from centres from time to time is the cause for concern and the decision to write you was, that you in your capacity as Minister, would order an inquiry into these allegations and if proved correct, you in your wisdom, will be able to exercise disciplinary measures against those members of the police force who are administering the law against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> incorrectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports on several occasions have indicated that there seems to be excessive use of the baton when arrests are carried out against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and one particular case which will be mentioned here, there are allegations of a fire-arm being discharged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I am afraid there would be a much greater public outcry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is true special legislation does exist which is applied to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders only in this State, this does not give sufficient reason for police officers when administering the common laws of the State, to act differently when its application is considered necessary against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps, to develop our argument further we would suggest you consult files of your Department which deals with ex-officers of your department, who have been charged and found guilty of crimes against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the actual lead up to the confrontation of hippies and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the reported incident was something that had occurred days previous between an Aborigine and a couple of hippies, but allegations are that the law had not been enforced correctly which created disharmony between the hippies and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Kuranda, which resulted in the reported incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main concern of this organisation is that while we are working towards Aboriginal advancement, we are endeavouring to build a better understanding of our people among nonAborigines in order to improve present existing race relations where our cultural differences seem to make it difficult for non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> people to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another incident I wish to bring to your notice and also ask that this be investigated, is the practice of some police officers making arrests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been drinking liquor and charged with drunkenness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received another phone call later from  Mrs Getawan’s  brother to say that on making application for bail and the release of Getawan, which was refused, he noticed that there was a number of other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the lockup and the number mentioned was rather staggering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Gordonvale incident I am ready to register a complaint regarding the attitude of some police officers towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which concern indiscriminate arrests against those who have been drinking liquor, but not necessarily, drunk, but none the less, arrested and charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>refusing to restore land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on reserves or in significant communities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little,  that the reference 1 was making was from a document prepared by  Mr Joseph  McGinness, the  President  of the Federal Council for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders - a man of standing in the black community and a man of standing in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that we do not get my speech out of context, let us understand that the grants being made to the States are for the protection and development of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for the easing of their many social problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disregard of personal privacy seems to be an accepted thing by those in authority, when it concerns <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this State and because of the existing legislation mentioned earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument to maintain this practice is that while <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are resident on reserves, they are occupants of Government houses and this gives every public servant the right of entry without the occupants consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not quote his name -  was equipped with a baton, no doubt to quell any riotious behaviour of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which never developed, but this sort of action, helped to provoke the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into being vocal and show some sort of resentment against such action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had many arguments in this chamber in relation to land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who is playing politics over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The offer by Lord Vestey has  been  taken up in the context of the Government’s acceptance of the recommendations of the Gibb Committee that a policy be adopted to enable community living areas for  Aborgines to  be established on pastoral properties and under the control of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I must take the Minister to task because land rights is one of the greatest problems facing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is not what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hold the Minister entirely responsible for many of the hold-ups in grants being made for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall the unfortunate death of one of the leading <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Palm Island and probably one of Australia’s leaders in the Aboriginal progress movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have asked the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts to initiate a royal commission into the conditions at that reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to the time when the Commonwealth Office of Aboriginal Affairs was established One of the aims of the Office was to establish <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own right in businesses, on farms and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  -  1 am highly critical of him: I am sure that he never saw 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> together until he was appointed to his present portfolio - there has been a severe scaling down of the number of grants made available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I live in the only State in Australia which has a population of more than 50,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and in the last several months I have not been able to find any Aboriginal to whom a grant has been made to enable him to establish his own business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know most of them, and I would say that each man and woman on that staff is determined to do his or her best for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders; but they are severely restricted not only by the Minister who does not know what his job is all about but also by the Prime Minister who does not care what it is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same problem is experienced in regard to Commonwealth grants for homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a Queensland Housing Commission scheme, for a long period beginning back in the days of the Labor governments in Queensland, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were able to use part of the money they had paid in rent as deposit on a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that their environment has caused our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have a skin pigmentation different from that which some may think is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 resisted that and I still resist that as a general way of helping the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because in my view it will not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may not have survived to this point of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody who has fairly considered the history of this country could say that the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, any more than the animal species of this disappearing continent before the white man came, would have survived through to this generation had it not been for the intervention of the white people, bringing the knowledge and skills of Europe with them which enabled them to tackle the deteriorating environment of this country and make it what it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be said that in the more lush sections of Australia such as Victoria and Tasmania there would always have been plenty on which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion now is that by Crown grant we should give particular land rights to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me appeal to him to listen, and he will understand that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are no different from us in their evolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a great deal of mythology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boys having to prove themselves before they are men and some of the physical things which girls are forced to go through as part of tribal rites are things which, if we leave the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> alone, they will not try to bring with them across the bridge from the environment which they once knew to the environment in which it is inevitable that they must some day live, unless the fools in the Opposition force them to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is being against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, 1 fail to see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that that is being interested in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and fighting for the things that are good for them - not telling them thai they have to leave anything behind but leaving it to them, as they develop, as they become educated and as they get the advantages of the money that will be provided by this Bill, to decide whether to cross the bridge between the 2 entirely different civilisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I draw attention to the fact that Opposition senators are trying to gain political capital by saying that the ‘Government is bad and is racist and that they, who have seen the light of a White Australia policy only a year or two ago, are the purists now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they expect too much they will destroy the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also condemned, according to the Opposition’s amendment, for refusing to restore land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out, there is a case for the ownership of land by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of social workers are employed helping the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to understand the difference between living in the environment that they are used to and transferring to a certain type of house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore the fact that in presenting this to the people of this country through the Parliament of this nation we hear read long lists of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been charged with this or that petty offence or something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who could imagine any Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> behaving in such a manner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as there are others in the Australian community, who for diverse reasons are incarcerated in gaols from one end of Australia to the other for short or long periods of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does no good for the cause of emancipation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that members of Parliament should say how the gaols are stacked with these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first steps towards the emancipation of any people caught in the circumstances in which our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are caught is to know and understand those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that concentration on the fact that some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to spend a night in the cells because they have seen too much of the moonshine in any way helps the cause of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - even if one gets the personal satisfaction of having a snide shot at members of the police force, who probably would not have wanted to put them in the cells but have an obligation to carry out their duty to the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little  has cried crocodile tears for over half an hour in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accepts no responsibility on behalf of the European race for the conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria we were very gentlemanly about it; we poisoned their water holes; we sent people out on shoots at weekends and awarded prizes for the person who got the largest number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were very sophisticated because we got the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> away from under our feet very quickly in the history of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same thing was done in Tasmania; the Tasmanians put the last surviving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on an island without food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining few that were not shot or poisoned we put on an island to starve; that is where the last of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Tasmania finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have forced the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the centre of Australia, forced them into areas where food is scarce, where they cannot live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have allowed the major mining interests in the world the right to go into those areas and to take all the wealth out of the ground - and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not get one penny as a share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the efforts of the Reverend Clint and people like him who worked in the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area they would be denied everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did we do to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when we came to this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have forced the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the most barren parts of Australia where there is the least food - and  Senator Little  says they may want to stay there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate -  Senator Little  may have forgotten - that full rights to control the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were granted to the Commonwealth 5 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have any crime figures for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Europeans, but I do recall that a person by the name of Namatjira was thrown into gaol for 6 months because he dared to give one of his children a drink of wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  quoted a Minister as having said: ‘We will move into Queensland and take certain action if the Government in that Stale is not prepared to alleviate the problems that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of that State are facing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, by this legislation, is continuing to treat <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to keep them as second class citizens yet to be a do-gooder towards them so that it can say: ‘Look at what we have done for the poor <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The collective blame for the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> belongs to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will get down to some reality in the future in relation to the real causes of the problems <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> face and not just stand here and carry on like a lot of missionaries trying to save the souls of people whom we have destroyed by our very actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for the granting to the States of the sum of SI 4.5m for the purpose of the advancement of the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The context in which this Bill has been brought to the Senate is a continuing programme by the Government to advance in a variety of ways the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been stated, but to a large extent ignored in the course of this debate, the Government will be providing some $53m this year for approximately 140,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, when one adds to the $53m which the Government will be providing the $!2m which the States themselves will be providing out of their own resources one gets an appreciation of the very significant monetary effort being made to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a variety of ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one can be sure that the course we are taking will, in the long run, be the most satisfactory course for the Aboriginal people or for their relationships with the rest of the people of Australia, but it is an effort which must be made and it is an effort which stems from a conscience which the Australian people have in an enlightened age with respect to activities which occurred a century or so ago between our forebears and the forebears of today’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is interesting to note that in Queensland alone the income derived from government investment in Aboriginal housing, in providing homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, amounted to approximately $100,000 last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, far from it being suggested that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not provided with any legal aid at all, last year a sum of SI 00,000 in direct grants from the Commonwealth was provided throughout Australia for legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 29 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> studying at universities and there are 9 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> undertaking other tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede - this was stated in the second reading speech, and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has conceded this - that this is a small number, but it represents a distinct improvement in the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, the establishment of the Aboriginal Trust Fund and the assistance - specifically monetary - which has been given to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a variety of ways to develop and build up their own identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the most significant documents ever delivered by a government with regard to the welfare and future of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia is the document which was delivered on 26th January this year by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think all honourable senators have received a copy of this document which is entitled ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - Commonwealth Policy and Achievements’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises the rights of individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with that society; and we believe that they will do so more readily and more happily when they are attracted to it voluntarily and when their membership of it encourages them to maintain and take pride in their identity, traditions and culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must endeavour by all within our power to have an integrated community in which the Aboriginal people will feel that they are part of the Australian community and that the nonAborigines of this country will accept the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as part of their community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do have a policy under which a new form of land lease, called a general purpose land lease, available on certain conditions to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as individuals, groups and communities for economic and social purposes, may be granted on the Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These general purpose leases will enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have a greater opportunity to acquire title to land in a form which is recognisable in Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration is being given to steps which will facilitate the incorporation of Aboriginal communities, strengthen the law protecting Aboriginal reserves and provide explicitly for hunting and foraging for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has indicated and given his full support to programmes for consultation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that background I was very interested to read a Press statement issued last Friday by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in which he announced that 2 Sydney journalists would receive the first Commonwealth Government awards for critical writing stimulating interest in and knowledge of the arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Council for the Arts, I am informed, made the recommendation some months ago but the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts sat on the recommendation for months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group comprising representatives of Primary Industry, Fisheries Division, CSIRO Applied Chemistry, CSIRO Fisheries and Oceanography, Departments of National Development, Navy, and Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, as well as a representative of the oil industry has been established to advise on materials and equipment to be stockpiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that re-naming the new Army helicopters after a tribe of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the electorate of the Minister for the Army,  Mr Katter,  will cost taxpayers an estimated $70,000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister rep resenting the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has supplied the following reply to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with the Government’s policy of removing legislation which discriminates against the native peoples of Australia, the Bill now before the Senate is one of 2 designed to remove the few remaining limitations between the war compensation benefits for which Torres Strait Islanders and certain mainland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are eligible and the war compensation benefits for which other Australian ex-servicemen are eligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, Torres Strait Islanders and mainland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who served in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces during World War II are eligible for benefits under the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in a conscious endeavour to improve the status of these ex-servicemen, this Government and preceding governments have lifted pension benefits to the point where at present the same war pensions and allowances, payable at the same maximum rates, are available to Torres Strait Islands members and mainland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act as are available to other former members of the forces under repatriation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not my intention to speak at length in this debate on the estimates of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill  asked whether action would be taken by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to give effect to the recommendations of the Mount Hagen conference concerning fauna conservation and protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appendices to the report presented by Estimates Committee B contain a letter from the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  which gives the Minister’s answers to the particular problems which concerned  Senator Douglas  McClelland during the course of the hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts appoints 4 or 5, whatever the number, of his own representatives to the Commonwealth Advertising Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ls it his intention to appoint to that committee persons who, over the years, have shown a very deep interest in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the preservation of their culture and heritage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then raised the matter in the Estimates Committee but on that occasion I went further and asked how many applications had been received from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and how many of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Postmaster-General consult with the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts so as to formulate standards for television advertisements, which would prohibit advertisements which display or promote defilement of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter raised by  Senator Willesee  appears to merit consideration for inclusion in the guidelines and the Board is proceeding in the matter in conjunction with the relevant industy bodies, and will consult the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has provided the folowing information: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister  representing the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts whether his attention has been drawn to statements by the DirectorGeneral of the Port of London Authority,  Mr John  Lunch, referring to the factual and quite magnificent results of that Authority in cleaning up the pollution of the River Thames. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, whom I represent in this chamber, is well aware of what has been done and what can be done in comparable areas in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated to  Mr O’Donnell  that the matter is under my consideration and it is also under the consideration of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts,  Mr Howson,  because he administers, for example, the Commonwealth Literary Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the present time, Torres Strait Islanders and mainland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who served in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces during World War fi are eligible for benefits under the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall that not so many years ago the then Minister for Housing was asked whether she could state the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders who had obtained war service homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Grants made available to the Commonwealth Office of Aboriginal Affairs are being channelled towards providing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the deposit that is necessary in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know,  Mr President,  the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment is currently investigating the social problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have deliberately mentioned the Commonwealth Office of Aboriginal Affairs which, under the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  has a direct responsibility to the Aboriginal people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a standing committee which is investigating right across the board 2 aspects of the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere is this more necessary than in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 islands which I have mentioned and others lie off the coast of Papua, but the residents of those islands are not Papuans, they are not New Guineans and they are not Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; they are Melanesian people, absolutely distinct from all the other ethnic groups to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was probably their home when the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> came to this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not related to the mainland New Guineans or the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Queensland Government got its sticky fingers on that land, after the previous Commonwealth Government released it to the Queensland Government, and it is still holding the land in cold storage because it hopes that if there is mineral development in this area it will sell that land at exorbitant prices not to the Torres Strait islanders or to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but to white people, and thus fill its own pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite might think it smart to interject because I speak as my brother Torres Strait islanders speak among themselves and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> speak amongst ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might sound funny to you people but it is our way of communicating and it is a&gt; way in which  Senator Keeffe  will never be able to communicate with Torres Strait Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could a white man understand the feelings of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Torres Strait islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can use it for some commercial purpose, but that is not the feeling of Torres Strait islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of the Gair Government in Queensland as far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait islanders are concerned it not one which can be supported and certainly is not to the credit of the Labor movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, interdepartmental arrangements have been made to try to improve the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Richard Hall is at present employed on the personal stall of  Mr Bryant,  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to whom he is acting as consultant on the affairs of urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Sydney and country towns in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, follows complaints that have been made to me that the unemployment benefit is not available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who by choice reside in Aboriginal communities and reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs inform the Senate in relation to the capital fund for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the number and total value of loans approved in each State and the Northern Territory for each year of operation of the capital fund and the number and total value of defaults and losses in each year in respect of each State and the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that the Government has approved of an additional advance of, I think, $6m for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is that offer in line with the advocacy by the Minister for Health,  Dr Everingham,  of the sterilisation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the statement referred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some circumstances in the Northern Territory in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which put this Bill  in  a slightly different category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one exemption in the electoral Acts applies to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  am not able to foretell the future, but from the spirit of the Acts  I  should imagine, without wishing in any way to intrude on the responsibilities of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  that the Government would want to move towards a situation in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do vote and, in due course, exercise the same rights and responsibilities as anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>network of offices supplemented by special measures such as recruitment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from north western areas, extensive advertising and recruitment of weekend pickers amongst school cadets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of this has been allocated to legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that $10m will go direct to expenditure on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today it might be thought that the Senate is passing this Bill to remove some racial discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whereas, if I understand the history of the Bill correctly, it was introduced originally to protect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> against exploitation by the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today it may be imagined by do-gooders that this was some sort of evil plot introduced by the white man to exploit and downgrade <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a concession has been given on this occasion it will not equalise the adverse effects which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> suffer as less privileged people of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and electors with young children are not uniformly dispersed throughout the various regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he use his influence to ensure that in future the media will not refer to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this nation in such an insulting way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> differ so dramatically and greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It inquired into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulties arise because there are tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, semi-tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and urbanised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have little contact with Western civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The semi-tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, those who move into places such as Alice Springs, Darwin or any major centre of population, have some contact, but they come and they go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their problems are different from the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who reside permanently on a particular settlement or in a town or city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the underlying purpose of Aboriginal advancement is the provision of a kind of assistance which will enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to stand on their own feet rather than to have to resort to massive handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The self respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been wonderful to see their deep respect for and their pride in their traditions and their people, most especially in those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are not completely urbanised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a most noble trait in the character of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been deeply impressed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have not been in contact with our civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to ensure that that self respect which these good people have is had by all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly those who live in the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be a greater provision for involvement by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance one matter affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been forced to live in a primitive environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To try to make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> move from that way of life and live in our present day environment would be to court disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one area in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not been able to keep pace with us, not because they could not do so but because the circumstances of their environment made it imprudent that they should even try. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as they feel more and more the impact of our modern type of civilisation, must face other problems with which they find it most difficult to cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A close study of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their simple environment reveals that they had excellent methods, for example, of maintaining family levels at a standard which was commensurate with their environment and which enabled them to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the impact of our type of civilisation on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, their family numbers have expanded out of all proportion to previous family numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those problems affect us and our community almost as much as they affect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or people of part Aboriginal descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have looked very closely at the allocations of the moneys, and 1 notice with great pleasure that the money is to be allocated to overcome some of the real problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly those living in cities and towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given the same opportunities as other Australians in the field of education and housing, and surely there is a real need for more to be done in the field of health than perhaps has been done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years I have advocated, both at the State and Federal levels, even prior to my becoming involved in politics, that perhaps one of the main solutions to many of the problems facing members of my race is the involvement of competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would require finance, but 1 believe that there is a greater need for the involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and I am pleased to note that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  has indicated that this is what he intends to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in my own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have applied for positions but unfortunately, because of some misunderstanding or something within the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, many of them have not had the courtesy of even receiving an acknowledgment of their applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the present Government is to bring forward policies, I would hope that the policies would be followed through and that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be given the opportunity to work amongst their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because far too often people advocate an overall policy for the cure of all the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot have an overall policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia today are in varying stages of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in, say, northern Queensland would not necessarily be the same as the answer to the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living around Melbourne or Sydney, or even in Townsville and Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there needs to be more in-depth studies of the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today many members of my race suffer what we may term psychological scars because of the destruction of their own customs, traditions and culture and because for far too many years <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were treated perhaps with less esteem than the household pet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could give many instances where this has happened, even in my own State of Queensland where perhaps <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been given a better deal than they have in any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the legislation which is brought forward in relation to education and health will not solve problems unless competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are fielded to liaise with their own people, to ensure that they are sure of their entitlements and where to go to receive them, and how to cope with the many problems they are facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the field to work with their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received at least 75 per cent of the total vote cast by all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders living in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me that indicates that I certainly have the support of the Aboriginal people in my own State, lt is difficult to obtain any percentages in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not living in communities because they are not identified as such On the rolls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said previously, I hope that some note will be taken of the employment and the involvement of competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the field of Aboriginal endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  can truthfully say that this is the first time  I  have been able to stand in this chamber and give wholehearted support to a Government move in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that the infant mortality rate among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was not a scandal - in other words, that we have to live with these sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possibly because members of the white community have easier access to facilities for medical treatment, enjoy a higher standard of living and have a diet that is vastly better than that of most black people, even in a State like Victoria where there is only a limited number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has this Bill set out in some ways to overcome the problem but also, I should imagine, when the Budget session of this Parliament takes place we will see an expansion of this Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into ever-widening areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually the Government will produce a Bill discriminating, if you tike, in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he believes in all sincerity - I think they were the words he used - that Queensland treats its <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders better than any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that he was being facetious because there are still some 30,000 people in Queensland living under the provisions of the infamous <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1972 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no real attempt to reduce the incidence of infant mortality and malnutrition; there has been no real attempt to overcome the housing shortage; there has been no real attempt to train <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders in trades and professions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if it were not for Commonwealth moneys the State of Queensland, the deep north, would be one of the most shocking in Australia in its treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bryant,  has tackled the problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do ask the members of this Senate to contrast the attitudes of this Government towards the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the attitudes adopted in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators would care to have a look at the photographs the Minister has of the conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living and were allowed to live by the previous Government they would realise that  Mr Gordon  Bryant is doing - I believe he will continue to do - a particularly fine job, and he has the full approval of the members of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little  said very pertinently that money alone is not a solution to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ problems and that many other questions are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very pleasing that  Senator Little  has taken a different attitude when speaking to this Bill from that which he took on the previous occasion when he spoke about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and said that he believed they owed a debt of gratitude to the white population of Australia because we had preserved their race which otherwise would have died out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my second reading speech I had incorporated in Hansard a document which listed a brief record of the actions initiated by this Government on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> since it took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of events which runs until 7th March shows that no period longer than 5 days elasped when we did not take some action to improve the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to set up a National Aboriginal Consultative Committee in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will participate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding  Senator Bonner’s  criticism of whether the money provided would go where it was needed, that is, whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory would get any of it, the answer is no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a grant to the States, and of course any assistance afforded to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory or in the Australian Capital Territory must be provided by a separate appropriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner  put special emphasis on the necessity for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to work among themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking of employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and consultation with experts on this question, he claimed himself as an expert who should be consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one must consider expertise in every field, and one cannot claim that in this field the colour of one’s skin necessarily implies expertise, lt could well be that governments have not accepted  Senator Bonner  because over the years his opinions have differed greatly from those of other honourable senators such as  Senator Keeffe  and  Senator Georges  who have taken a keen interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has been well advised by those who would be accepted as experts on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the praise he has received was justified for no Minister and no government has done more for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last evening I attended a conference on the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will live successfully in their own culture as they always have, that they will succeed and that we will make them useful members of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner referred to the necessity for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to work by themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present when officers of my Department are working in any area where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a venture which is producing a product that can be used in a contract being undertaken by my Department, they are required to consult the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on whether that product can be utilised in the contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a brick making plant in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The protest made at this stage is that, despite the disparity in price, it would have been of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area if brick houses had been specified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While 11 houses are being constructed at Gove today, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not making bricks because the bricks cannot be utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, we have been trying to force health measures upon the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to reach  a  position where they accept them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the Legislative Council,  Mr Greatorex,  is a member of the Country Party as is  Mr Kentish  from Arnhem Land who probably knows more and has a greater background in relation to the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than any other member in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another great field of social endeavour the new Labour Government has set off at a very smart pace to up grade the standards of living for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not, however, permit any State Government or State agency to frustrate the clear will of the Australian people recorded so overwhelmingly in the 1967 Referendum that the national Government should assume constitutional responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among many measures already announced, my Government will give priority to establishing Aboriginal land rights and to ensuring that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are truly equal before the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already an inquiry is being conducted into the restoration of tribal lands to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the handicaps that the Commonwealth Parliament has to face is that, in spite of the fact that it is a number of years since the 1966 referendum was conducted, the previous Government did not carry out any surveys on health, employment, housing or educational requirements for islanders or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking not only about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders but also people in all sorts of low income brackets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also is concerned with other activities on behalf of the Government in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I know is that a consultative committee comprised of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and elected from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is to be formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incest amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, does he agree that the research project implies that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are more incestuous than other Australians and’ is therefore insulting to the decent, law-abiding Aboriginal citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as we have embarked on a determined campaign to restore the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their rightful place in Australian society, so we have an obligation to remove methodically from Australia’s laws and practices all racially discriminatory provisions and from international activities any hint or suggestion that we favour policies, decrees or resolutions that seek to differentiate between peoples on the basis of the colour of their skins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the expressed intention of the Commonwealth Government to take over direct responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already a request -has ‘ been received from one State’ for the Commonwealth Government to take over certain State powers concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has advised me that the provision of a tutor in jewellery making for the Aboriginal community at Jiggalong in Western Australia is part of a national program to train <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia in the production of jewellery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project is aimed at providing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in depressed communities in remote areas with a means of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very special quasi-agreement which, as I said 6 years ago, mirrors the kind of treaty one would have expected among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - I say this with great respect to my colleague,  Senator Bonner,  who will know that I am not reflecting in any way upon the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - of 150 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government continues its proliferation of bureaucracy in this portfolio and does not get round to dealing with the real issues - treating <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as dignified Australians who are equal to other Australians and not people to be patronised or simply representing a social welfare situation, as New Zealand did with its Maoris for a long while, much to its regret - very soon there will be as many public servants looking after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as there are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to juniors, some 40 have been placed and BHP is willing to take six juniors per week in future and to consider the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been used for the making of regulations to prohibit the export of such items of national importance as archaeological specimens relating to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 16 May I asked the Minister a question concerning the election by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of 80 representatives from all States and the Northern Territory to the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: When the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee is finally established what powers, if any, will this body have in relation to legislation affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Committee be given the opportunity to scrutinise legislation affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before it is introduced in the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Federal Government is soon to assume full responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the Commonwealth, what is the Government’s list of priorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth will then have full power over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra authorise an aircraft charter which last week took a party of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Hooker Creek to Yuendumu and back again, involving about 2,000 miles flying in 3 days? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that advice has been sent through the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs to voluntary organisations employing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they should not pay <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wages comparable to those paid by the Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the people involved were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the existence of the embassy was an embarrassment to Australia, as it ought to have been, in pointing out to the rest of the world the unjust treatment given to our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its determination to move against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the previous Government was prepared to offend one of the great principles of the law, namely, that criminal action should not be retrospective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the word ‘dreadful’ because it was aimed at the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Ordinance became a symbol of the action that has been taken against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not dwell on that point because the real issue is this: Is the Opposition so intent on endeavouring - whether or not its endeavours are successful is another matter - to restore an unnecessary ordinance which is aimed at the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when that ordinance was a symbol of attempts to prevent the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from making their feelings known in a dramatic way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After years of endeavouring to get justice, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> thought that the only way to achieve their ends was to come here and put their embassy right in front of Parliament House and stay there until their problems were understood and some attention was paid to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a great deal of his speech this morning he dwelt on the suggestion that this matter was entirely involved with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, there were very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> associated with the whole team of people who congregated outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee found that the genuine <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community would not have a bar of those people who arrived here in Jaguars or the long haired individuals who came from universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree that the original ordinance was introduced in a spirit of opposition to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, of racism, or whatever other fancy terms are used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not consider that the original ordinance was aimed against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have sat in this chamber and have listened, as I have listened for many years, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being used as a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the previous Government spoke of introducing that ordinance I spoke strongly against it because I felt that it was being brought in to remove my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the lawns in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any more disgraceful than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sleeping on creek banks throughout this Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact I did not agree with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> camping on the lawns of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  spoke of all the wonderful things that his Government is going to do for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be watching very closely, as will many of my fellow-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to see what will happen in relation to Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this chamber speaking on matters that affect all Australians and not just having the opportunity of speaking only on Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that if the occasion arises and I feel strongly enough about it I will certainly stand on the lawns of Parliament House with other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that the time will come when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will want to return here and make some protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will then be able to protest with the dignity with which their forefathers roamed this nation before the coming of the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a large participation by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The office will give free legal advice on matters of federal law, including the Matrimonial Causes Act, to everyone in need and on matters of both federal and State law to persons for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibility, such as pensioners, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, exservicemen and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the AttorneyGeneral confirm recent reports to the effect that the Government intends introducing during this session legislation outlawing discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is far reaching legislation which I am sure will be welcomed by all in this country and especially by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra authorise the charter of an aircraft last week which took a party of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Hooker Creek to Yuendumu and back again, involving about 2,000 miles of flying in 3 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was under the impression that as from 1 July this year the powers of the South Australian Government over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were transferred to the federal sphere but I cannot be definite about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds made available to a community under these arrangements will be paid from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund to a local community fund to be administered by Aboriginal trustees for the benefit of the particular community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether he will confer with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Treasurer with a view to making an additional sum of money available immediately to upgrade sharply the socio-economic conditions of” <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Palm Island reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, will the Government take urgent steps to institute the following: The installation of sewerage for every home; improved wages, with at least the basic wage for every worker; provision of a Commonwealth medical team to include available Aboriginal nurses, to work on the reserve for at least 6 months; and the application of pressure on the Queensland Government to abolish the Acts related to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> thus giving mental and physical freedom to all who live on the reserve? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by referring to a letter which I received from  Mr B.  G. Dexter, Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, in which he informed me that he had only limited supplies of the following publications: ‘Aboriginal Art of Australia’, ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia’, The Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’, and ‘After the Dreaming’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister ensure that the Department has sufficient numbers of these publications to distribute to schools as they are important in educating the non-Aboriginal people towards a better understanding of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Aboriginal culture? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the contribution these documents make to educating school children and society towards a better understanding of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While on the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I would like to give some further information to the honourable senators who asked questions about Nola Brown, the 7-year- old Aboriginal girl from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure it will be apparent from many of my public statements that I regard <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as being especially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know full well that we <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not short on intelligence, energy, imagination and a whole host of other abilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am equally sure that 99.9 per cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish to make use of their skills and abilities, not only for their own benefit but also for the benefit of the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said on previous occasions, in past years many of my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been excluded through prejudice from taking up positions which would enable them to contribute to society to the degree that they should and, I am sure, to the degree that they would wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently it is my view that any money spent on improving housing, health services, education facilities and training programs as a necessary prerequisite to a full contribution by Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have unique talents and are in a position to influence for the good our Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to note that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in all areas of Australia, particularly those in Aboriginal communities, are now in receipt of social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter causes me great concern because I believe there are some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who, because of a lack of knowledge and understanding of their entitlements, perhaps are not able to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator probably knows that on previous occasions I have advocated that competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should move among their own people in order to ensure that they are made aware of the many benefits available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out for the record that if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland are not applying for social service benefits then the fault must surely lie with the State authorities who administer all reserves in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs no doubt is aware of the many reported instances of police intimidation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these actions  Mr Gordon  Bryant acted to protect not only the expenditure of large sums of public moneys but the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are doing in the methods we are using in this operation is proving that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are commercial failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this is not the way to assist the Aboriginal community; rather it would give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> complete inferiority complexes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that after the finalisation of oyster fishing in the Torres Strait Islands area, there were 5,000 unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he is yet in a position to give the facts in connection with the plight of some 200 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Utopia station in central Australia who have been reported as subsisting on a starvation diet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator CAVANAGHThe report which I received on this question was that the squatter had refused supplies to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there was some justification for the report that there was a system under which some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were without food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister appointed by the Labor Government who was concerned with this matter allocated finance from the trust fund for the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not problems which were initiated by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the Torres Strait Islanders but problems initiated by generations of white people, and the onus is on generations of white people to solve them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement issued today by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> their first point is as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer to a few other points on the manifesto issued by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no quarrel as to whether a council, which is all black, has the right to issue or withdraw or withhold a permit of that nature, but I have a quarrel with the continuation of 2 Acts- one for Torres Strait Islanders and one for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- which should have been abolished many years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in fact any authority that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may have as members of a council is of an extremely limited nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> seek restoration of tribal titles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rights of access of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to pastoral properties; the protection of sacred sites on pastoral leases, and the recognition of land rights by the diverting of lease payments or mining royalties from the Crown to appropriate Aboriginal groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today I received a lengthy letter from a white man who has been closely associated with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> gathered on the lawns outside Parliament House, re-erected the Aboriginal embassy, and generally behaved in a most orderly manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of Aborigine Affairs be upgraded to Ministerial level and the Commonwealth assume the ultimate responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders accorded it by the referendum of 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have equal rights and opportunities with all other Australians, and every form of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be ended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to receive the standard rate of wages for the job and to receive the same industrial protection as other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> shall have the right to receive social services in the same way as all other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They now have this right to receive social services in the same way as all other Australians but there are people at the administrative level, particularly at the State government departmental level, who are not properly informing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on this and I would seriously suggest a training program for some of our white officers who ought to know better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim, of course, it must be necessary for properties to be acquired but I would respectfully suggest to the Minister and to the Department that we speed up the legal investigation of granting land rights to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area in which something has been done is in the area of Aboriginal secondary grants, which now include all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had to reach the age of 14 years before they qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fill the gaols in this country for periods ranging from 14 days to 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a self help sort of thing in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are actually participating in the construction of the homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me deal, firstly, with the demonstration by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in front of Parliament House this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government has a long list of the things it has done for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as a result of his discussions with the Commissioner of Police in Queensland the proper treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be included in the course of training undertaken by police cadets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time that any attempt has been made to bring under Commonwealth control the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Criticism was made that loans advanced to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not recoverable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Department makes loans to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> it tries to get security for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be, as  Senator Keeffe  says, that greater liaison between the Department and the Aboriginal community is needed to try to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in management control for development of their projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not neglectful of the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs employes 600 persons of whom ISO are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come to my notice that the Department of Education employs some 600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was thought that this would result in an important preference being extended to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the particular position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not applied for staff positions which were notified in many recent advertisements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A possible reason for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not applying for such positions was stated to be that they do not read newspapers; and since advertisements are placed in newspapers it could well be that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not know of the vacancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that this problem can be overcome if we get the establishment of the National Aboriginal Consultative Council to which 41 persons will be elected by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves and that they, we hope, will achieve liaison between the people, the Department and the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what was the percentage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> invited to the opening of the Opera House in relation to the total number of people invited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In directing this question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I refer to his statement in which he referred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their services and said that he wanted a parliamentary committee established to oversee all spending on all Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment is already conducting an intensive inquiry into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that the reference to that Committee includes the matters to which he has referred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that there is a House of Representatives committee conducting a similar inquiry into the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When State officers know the locations within a State, the Aboriginal peoples resident in it and become very close to the actual conditions and requirements of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in certain areas, there is a background of understanding which I feel is vital to achieve that to which we all aspire- the betterment of the conditions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is vitally important in connection with the accountability of governments for spending of public moneys: There have been actions which tend not to improve the lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but to worsen it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not trying to attribute blame to anyone, because blame in this area is of no advantage to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many people who need assistance who are not <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the true sense of the word nor <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the sense that it will be the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One separate group is the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in the far north of Western Australia and the Northern Territory and who live under an entirely different set of circumstances and have to face different problems emanating from those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They perhaps have a common background with other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but they pose a completely different picture which requires an approach completely different from the approach which would be adopted in some localised city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who did this or who did not do that for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is all a part of Australia ‘s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the referendum of 1967 certainly gave powers to the Commonwealth Governmentthe Australian Government as it is now called- to make special laws for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government, in its 1972-73 Budget, allocated $7m for the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what happened here last week and what is happening at the moment on the lawns in front of Parliament House is an indication that the present Government is certainly bungling some of the promises that it made in its election campaign so far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland is not the only State that has <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> then were lumbering on the river banks in the humpies that  Senator Bonner  and I know of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I can gather the situation is not very much different in those cases where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been relegated to the woodheap and humpies on the edge of the tip in country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been an appalling situation and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are demonstrating now because nothing like this legislation has ever been introduced into the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Bonner  made a statement recently calling for land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying now is that all members of the Liberal Party at that point of time voted against any suggestion in this chamber that land rights be restored to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is a little late in the day to start criticising the Government which is doing everything it possibly can to give back to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the land over which they have tribal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to be able to co-operate with all the State Governments so that the appropriate legislation can be passed by all parliaments- State and Commonwealthand tribal title to land can be restored to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was resolved on the basis that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland were to get no land rights and that there was to be no confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For heaven’s sake, let us face up to our moral obligations for a start and let us face up to the white man’s problem that has been imposed on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already big steps have been taken to bring <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in other States under Commonwealth control, and it is in this area where the major portion of the investigation in order to restore lands legally to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is currently being carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not continue to make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the subject of a political argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth takes over from the States further powers in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there will be a need for the State employees who have the skills to deal with Aboriginal affairs to transfer to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am inclined to believe that both the States and the Commonwealth have over the years desired to do the best that they could for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are allocating $30m to the States for new housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because we acknowledge that the State housing authorities have the machinery for providing housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While for the foreseeable future the State housing commission will provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of a special allocation, the time may come when the States cannot progress quickly enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> come into the city to work but do not stay because they do not have accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many problems common to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wherever they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are searching to find job opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in the life of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> since white men occupied Australia, white men are listening to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, although perhaps not sufficiently in the opinion of some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are establishing the National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Consultative Council which will advise the Government and will report back to the Aboriginal people about Government policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will bring the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the tribal areas to the central administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is Labor’s policy to recognise the rights and the cultures of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs inform the Senate of the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have enrolled for the purpose of electing the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is the Minister aware that a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have enrolled because they were threatened with the loss of government assistance in the fields of education, housing and other assistance which is important to their advancement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have enrolled was published in the Press a few days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Gordon  Bryant, was reported to have indicated to an Aboriginal university student that he was prepared to offer university students long vacation employment, will the present Minister consult those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are engaged in tertiary education and offer them the same opportunities as the former Minister did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department did some detailed study on the payment of subsidies to any enterprise which would employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now having a great deal of success in this regard, the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed at the present time being greater than ever was the case previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told  Senator Bonner  yesterday in answer to a question that I would have for him today figures relating to the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> enrolled for the purpose of electing members of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the policy of the Department of preference being given to Aboriginal people, subject to their having the qualifications necessary for the particular positions, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be employed if they make application and if they have the qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that 4 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> landed at Darwin and then wanted their fares home to be paid for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware of Press reports that 3 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protesting at the bombing of Quail Island, which they claim is sacred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he inform the Senate what steps he intends to take to assist the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to preserve the right of their Aboriginal tribe which is making a claim regarding the sacredness of this island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A protest was raised this year by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wanted the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have gone there to squat and to see that no bombing takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we still have the problem of conveying this information to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has set out to establish a condition in the community to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders to regain their status as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that Minister Hewitt, who made one of the replies today, and  Mr Row,  the Country Party member for Hinchinbrook, probably aided and abetted by the Premier of Queensland, decided to keep <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a state of subjection and degradation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has reached agreement with Western Australian and South Australia, is making more than satisfactory progress in New South Wales and Victoria, and has laid down a blueprint for the Northern Territory that will allow the Commonwealth Administration to legislate and administer for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither has made a real attempt to ascertain the real problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and both apparently are showing signs of trying to hold up the Australian Government ‘s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If by the description ‘Black Power’ these gentlemen are implying that I am advocating equal rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders, then I am happy to be so classified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The red headband symbolises the blood that has been spread by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over a period of many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the recommendations which are currently being examined by the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and his Department are a fishing development which will involve quite a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, agriculture development which is a long range planning project, an oyster farm which will have not a great amount of personal involvement but which as a long term project could be highly lucrative, and possibly a minor tourist project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though in the north more missions were eventually established than  Mr Meston,  who was then prominent in this field, would have considered necessary or desirable, there was little direct governmental activity in the area for many years and the Government concerned itself primarily with the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the settled areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The collection of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> onto reserves and their total exclusion from towns, except in properly regulated employment, entailed legislation to end their unfettered liberty to roam about and mix with whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would then be considered necessary to appoint a chief protector and assistant protector, and to confer on them power to send <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to reserves and keep them there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The utterances of the State Minister today would indicate that the general attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has not changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an intention behind the utterances of the Minister to take away the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the Australian sphere and to keep them isolated, then I think it is to be regretted and deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, this would restore dignity to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are men who are trying to do the right thing by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but always they are weighed down by the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that light note I make this final appeal: It is the responsibility of the Australian Government to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in this country are given the dignity that is their right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, the only people who were entitled to be short-tempered at all were members of the staff of the Committee, although they may have been responsible to some degree for this because the program they set us meant that we often started at 6 o’clock in the morning and finished up still interviewing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and talking to people sometimes as late as II o ‘clock at night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise only to associate myself with the sentiments that have been expounded by  Senator Little  on the conduct of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment and its investigation into the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the parliamentary discussion states that Minister Hewitt stated that department officers had gone to Lockhart Mission for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Cape York after the bashing of a mission manager who is resigning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the facts as I can find them, with reference to  Mr Max  Hawkins’s inquiry, we have obtained the following information from National Aboriginal Consultative Committee sources at Cairns -and I take it that Max Hawkins was an NACC officer in Cairns- based on an account by 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Lockhart River: On the evening of 13 November, a resident Aboriginal who had been drinking wine went to the canteen and asked for and received a drink of beer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might dispute this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that for the last few years some 90 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Ernabella and Hermannsburg missions and Amata and Indulkana reserves have been going to the River Murray area in South Australia to work during the fruitpicking season and have been earning between $60 and $90 per week for 8 weeks or more? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that the South Australian Community Welfare Department received a grant of $ 1 5,000 each year from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to supervise the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during the fruit harvest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the Department of Labour was prepared to take over the role as long ago as last August, to make sure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were employed, but that it has had no reply from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister has recently taken over the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, will he straighten out this bungling by the Department which could affect the employment of some 90 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money was voted each year for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were placed on fruit-picking ventures along the Murray River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of reports which we received and complaints about the behaviour or treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, this year the $15,000 was not made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been taken up by the Department of Labour, which is anxious to supply labour for the fruit growers, rather than the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which is concerned with the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be realised that a lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> entitled to enrol have not done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for their non-enrolment could well be that they have no knowledge of their entitlement to enrol although we have done everything possible to get field officers to visit all sections of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they are true <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or of other descent I do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to have a conference at the first opportunity with the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs to see whether we can iron out some of the differences in that area and some of the problems I have encountered in reports about Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and electors with young children are not uniformly dispersed throughout the various regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As stated in the Press today, it involved the supply of some 34 houses, I believe in 1970, to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory under the then Minister for the Interior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We get the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to erect the houses when the materials arrive at the site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aged, the chronically ill, the migrant groups and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not enjoy the full measure of human rights and dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discrimination affects <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so far as it concerns the administration of the criminal law and the enjoyment of civil, political, social and economic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that proportionately more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than whites are sentenced to imprisonment or denied bail in Australia has been amply demonstrated in the writings of  Dr Elizabeth  Eggleston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the poorest of the poor in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be the height of hypocrisy for white Australians now to say to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that from here on the race must be on equal terms, without taking into account the 180 years start which white Australians have given themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1965 and 1967, before and after the last referendum- on the nexus with the Senate and also on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- the Australian Capital <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe- I know- that it had its birth within the tentacles of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially this organisation did not know or even understand anything about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Torres Strait Islanders because it was conceived in Victoria under the leadership of  Mr Gordon  Bryant, the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, members of this organisation in that part of Australia would have known nothing about Torres Strait Islanders in particular, and very little about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders has been, and as I understand it still is, a radical organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the former Minister took office last year he announced his intention of consulting with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have travelled around a lot, particularly in my own State of Queensland and I am finding that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are confused and that they have been brainwashed into what I believe can be only termed living separately and being separate from the rest of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe any council which has consultative powers only is useless- in fact <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are still going to go begging and asking through a whole lot of red tape- they still can’t make any decisions and ‘their’ representatives don’t have the same powers as the Parliamentarians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a much more effective measure would be to make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> more politically aware by means of education and publicity so that they enrol in State and Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows the feelings of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the same way as I do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  in answer to a question I asked some weeks ago in this chamber has informed me that there are about 30,000 or 40,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> enrolled out of a population of 162,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not enrol on a separate Aboriginal roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are ways in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be consulted without electing or establishing what we might call an Aboriginal bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will they be going around talking to the Aboriginal people in their districts or will they be sitting in a big office and waiting for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to come and tell them what they want? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there will be many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> coming into the big, plush offices that the members of the Committee will have because basically the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who need advice are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who will not come to a big. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those reasons have been substantiated by another very prominent Aborigine and many other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my own State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do feel that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be brainwashed into a kind of auto-apartheid situation where they will be a separate section in the Australian community, and I do not want that to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to see <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> become part and parcel of the general Australian scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> encouraged to take part in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I happen to be an Aborigine and I have suffered some of the problems that are suffered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The formation of this council was one of the dirtiest tricks to play on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a Minister you should be ashamed of your actions because you picked members of your own groups to back you up- people that most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland do not acknowledge as being capable of speaking for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They gave guns to some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to shoot and kill their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now you are giving power and money to 41 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to undermine our way of living and thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you trying to be a Big Number One boss, as most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I know are saying? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words: honour, justice and equality means a lot to mc and my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True consultation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be consultation with what I can only term as an Aboriginal bureaucracy which will be set up comprising a few well paid <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who will not and can never truly represent Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that it is a story which was given birth inside the Liberal Party in opposition to the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as put forward by the Government I support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first real attempt by any government to hear the voice of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to correct another point for  Senator Bonner  who said that NACC was established by the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I would not know how many were at the conference but I do know that there were a lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there from every State in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The big problem that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have had to face is that they have not been able to unite and fight a common cause, because the white man has consistently kept them divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Are you denying that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to be called <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All members of the steering committee were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A campaign is now under way urging that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs should be controlled purely by Aboriginals, that no white man should be in the Department because white men do not understand <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that of the 120,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia 36,700 have enrolled in the ballot and 193 nominations to contest the ballot have been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is comparatively new and it allows <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to follow new lines of thinking because it promises a recognition of the Aboriginal people and a chance that they will be listened to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition,  Senator Georges  was interviewed about this matter on ABC television in ‘This Day Tonight’ on 1 1 October together with the former Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, the Honourable P. Howson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the following question: Owing to the utter confusion in relation to the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee election last Saturday and in view of the lack of training of Aboriginal enrollers and co-ordinators and the limited time allocated for the setting up of the necessary mechanics, will the Government accept the responsibility for the outcome rather than passing the blame on to the employed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very proud to accept the responsibility for the election, which was well conducted and in which there was great interest in most areas, shown by the numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the visit made prior to a recommendation to the Minister that portion of the barracks area be taken over as a hostel for single <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Palm Island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My Department is responsible for a company called Aboriginal Hostels Ltd which has been formed for the purpose of securing suitable hostels for the housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially single <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who come to towns or areas for the purpose of schooling or employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, because of a reduced vote or for any other reason, an Army establishment was not required by the Army, then I could think of no better use for it than the housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who want homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should add that, as is referred to in the various international convenants, there are laws, which confer some benefit or advantage on, for example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Torres Strait Islanders under the laws of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of ministerial control over and ministerial responsibility for expenditure from the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefit Trust Fund and the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in the history of Australia, the Aboriginal people of this country are to be consulted, through a committee elected by them, on what should be done in matters relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that they, directly through this Committee, can advise the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament on what they, as the people best able to judge, believe to be the interests of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have today is a definite and deliberate decision by the Australian Labor Party to arrogate to Canberra and the bureaucrats, mainly through the exercise of the power of the purse, all power over housing, all power over education, all power over health, all power over minerals, all power over conservation, all power over finance, all power over the control of off-shore minerals, all power over the control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and all power over the control of arts and a host of other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has introduced into this Parliament legislation to control fuel resources, mineral resources, health, education and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to excite any acrimony in this debate but in the briefest possible way I wish to indicate the intensity of my feeling about the squandering of public money not for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but to the enrichment of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points raised by  Senator Laucke  were discussed by Estimates Committee E. The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said in his policy speech that his Government would make all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> equal in law with white men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that to achieve this end <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were entitled to legal counsel if they appeared in court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the Government took office many solicitors and barristers in Sydney were giving their time free of cost to a voluntary legal aid service for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these organisations employ a solicitor on a full time basis who is able to give legal advice to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition they employ girls to undertake office duties and many of them employ a field officer to ascertain the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing this, we feel that while keeping within the allocation of $700,000 we can maintain the operations in the interests of the Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who have been led to expect certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the restructuring of Applied Ecology Pty Ltd and its new purpose will have a beneficial effect on the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The company will seek methods of farming of native animals and sea life in areas where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could be employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established legal aid services in all capital cities, extending out to country areas where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are assembled, for the purpose of trying to convey this advice to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do so because they are unacquainted with the service that we provide and we find difficulty in informing them of the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone who knows <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can convey it to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through a publicity campaign conducted by field officers employed by the Aboriginal legal service we are having it more widely accepted, and I believe that in the near future  Senator Murphy’s  department will extend the legal aid which may be provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of ministerial or departmental control over funds expended on housing projects for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with particular reference to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of Ministerial or Departmental control over funds expended on housing projects for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, with particular reference to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article involved a reply that I had supplied to a question asked by  Mr Hunt  which referred to the housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no common policy which can be applied to meet the requirements of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their various settings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that policies in relation to Aboriginal advancement should be resilient enough to accommodate the very real differences between the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their semi-tribal state, those in the part urban situaion who go back to the tribal situation, and those in urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when I speak of moneys being allocated, I am saying that we have no objection but rather welcome every possible concern and assistance which can be rendered to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Torres Strait islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He points out that in many instances moneys are being devoted not to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but to administering schemes in a proportion which is far in excess of that which should apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who is the present Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant),  was a very generous man and a man who sought in a very real way the betterment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am an Aborigine and have moved amongst my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in my own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that my colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment will agree with me when I say that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in varying stages of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the people want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in their community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A program of self-help must be introduced to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to better themselves in the community so that they can become respected and responsible members of it as fellow Australians, not as something separate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the risk attached to assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> financially there must be from time to time some wasteful expenditure which does not produce results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ventures that we are supporting at the moment- and this was raised by  Senator Lawrie-  is the purchase of cattle properties for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the properties that we have purchased have a white experienced cattle manager who trains <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to manage the property and to carry out the various operations involved in property ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> work on the properties, all of which are in areas where Aboriginal communities are established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision has been made in this Bill for grants to be given to the State Housing Commission for the housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst these homes are built by the States and are owned by the States they are occupied by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who do not qualify for the normal waiting list must comply with the tenancy requirements of the various State Housing Commissions and must be able to meet the interest and rental payments that make for a viable proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot meet the requirements laid down by the State Housing Commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, fewer than 10 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria would qualify for Housing Commission homes in that State which could be financed with the allocation made under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I said, another section of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot meet the requirements of the Housing Commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where money is not the solution, establishing an involvement has created an interest among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which has not been seen in such communities before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I criticised  Senator Bonner  for his use of the expression ‘the various stages of their development’ in referring to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an expression I hate to see applied to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are seeking to take industries to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rather than to bring the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now getting claims from various councils that they want to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on such jobs as kerbing and guttering work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That work probably would not be available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if money provided for Aboriginal affairs were not involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present an amount of, say, $10,000 is made available to provide employment for 8 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for 8 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless I hope the day will come when money set aside for Aboriginal affairs will be expended on projects which will not only provide employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and give them an opportunity to participate in the management of their own affairs but also produce something effective for their own purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts in the previous government,  Mr Howson,  saying that the fact that he lost his seat at the last Federal election was due very much to the organisation of the Lake Pedder action group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among them were invitations to be guest of honour at the National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Day Observance Committee ball in Adelaide on Friday night, 16 November and to open the Scottsdale Show on Saturday afternoon, 17 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We seek to amend extensively the present National Health Act in order to eliminate the weaknesses in the voluntary scheme and to extend its coverage to the low-income single earner, to those with larger families, to pensioners, to newly arrived migrants and to <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, under this Bill, the Commonwealth would enter into negotiations with the State governments for an alternative arrangement to the subsidised health benefits scheme which would be more suitable to the special needs of tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide legal advice and assistance on all matters of Federal law, including the Matrimonial Causes Act, to everyone in need; and on matters of both Federal and State law, to persons for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibility for example, pensioners, <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, exservicemen and newcomers to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the visit made prior to a recommendation to the Minister that portion of the barracks area be taken over as a hostel for single <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Palm Island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-84-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he has more to offer in the way of solutions to the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than is realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was playing up to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to remember is that in this country there are between 12 million and 13 million nonAboriginal people and there are 150,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whether they are full-blooded, half-caste, quarter-caste or one-eighth Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the way in which the Prime Minister has been going on one would think that these 150,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were the 12 million or 13 million non-Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rumours were current on Wednesday evening that there would be a sit-in by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the Department’s offices on the Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility of a sit-in was anticipated but they decided not to seek police protection as it had an upsetting effect upon the staff and because they have always been able to reason with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who came there in protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of a capitulation and subsequent paternalistic handling by the Prime Minister, the Minister and the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the recent situation concerning an Aboriginal senior public servant, does he feel that a grave disservice has been rendered to my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will notice that the Commonwealth has been given powers in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not just a matter of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> accepting an Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could have been no more thoroughly articulated request for a mandate on any subject than that which was requested in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> find themselves in somewhat the same position as the negroes in the United States of America who were deluded into believing that the passage of a law would give them freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> believed in an instant dignity and an instant freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many young people of my race can do much by working within the present system because I believe that the present system can be made to work for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we see the light at the end of the tunnel and I hope that we will not allow it to be blocked by irresponsible actions by our young people and by non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who would use them for their own political gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, are now being given opportunities that hitherto were denied to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am conscious of the fact that there are in the community non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are in need of considerable assistance, but I do not believe that that is any reason to knock what is being done for the descendants of the conquered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am grateful for what has been done and for the efforts that have been made to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but sometimes I am sick at heart because we are being made a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Cavanagh,  the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, said that the Government’s policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It intends to eliminate any remnants of discriminatory State legislation against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a hope declared but unfulfilled by an earlier Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the subject of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is an indictment on us all and on the nation that the single greatest problem facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> every day is the difficulty they have in filling in a form such as a welfare form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are well behind our technology and our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been chartering aircraft in South Australia for officers to fly to Aboriginal settlements and missions for the purpose of encouraging <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to claim unemployment benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does the Minister regard this advocacy to be in the best long term interest of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being condemned to be recipients of handouts without the prospect of being equipped to take up gainful employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the visit of the officers is not to advise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> about unemployment entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves, other than those who have been dismissed from work on the reserves, have no unemployment benefit entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> previously receiving the training allowance now have an entitlement to unemployment benefits if no other employment can be provided for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surprisingly, there are very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the reserves and very few off the reserves who are drawing unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money is not coming from unemployment benefit, and in respect of the recent accusation about Ceduna in South Australia, the manager of the reserve pointed out that no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on that reserve are receiving unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there is more wealth amongst all sections of our community today and that there is unfortunately a small group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> associated with fringe city development who are not utilising the additional money in the best interests of what we consider to be good living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now introduced such a substance to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and there must be a period when it has an undesirable effect on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that in some sections of our community there is condemnation of the behaviour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> after taking liquor but no one has thought to study and supervise the position in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solution to the problem is to lift the standard of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that they have some ambition in life and do not have to drown their sorrows and frustrations in liquor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken the figures for the referenda that have been held, apart from the conscription referendum and excluding the last referendum on prices and incomes and, I think, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are migrants who are not able to vote, if there are children who are not able to vote and if there are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have not yet enrolled, those people will comprise part of the population- the non-voting population- yet they will be the persons who will be counted in determining the equality of electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special works projects have been introduced whereby we give money to local councils for the purpose of the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for Aborigi  nal Affairs indicate, or will he ascertain and let us know, the exact amount which to date has been paid in respect of legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Tasmania, the number of applications received and the average amount expended? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In presenting this second progress report, I wish to refer only briefly to the activities of the Senate Standing Committees on Social Environment in its examination of the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our thinking on these matters of principle, as expressed in the report, has been crystallised by our consideration of the evidence and other material available to us, and not least by our direct experience among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whom we have met and seen in their own communities during our field work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has come to the conclusion that over the years there has been a deficient understanding of Aboriginal culture and the specific nature and strength of its influence on the responses of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the technological economy and life style of Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our view that, because of this, too many of the failures of the past have been wrongly attributed to alleged shortcomings of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above and beyond this, in our view, there has been too little recognition of the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be consulted in a meaningful way in respect of programs for the advancement and welfare of Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second progress report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment relating to its reference to investigate the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islands and the preservation of their sacred sites has been brought forward by its  Chairman,  Senate Keeffe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in the inquiry the Committee noted a strong feeling in the witnesses making submissions on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that there were great problems of ignorance and disorientation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This paints the background from which so many of the issues relating to the wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned and into which the Committee inquired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the submissions put to us in various ways was that within the Australian European community there is a lack of appreciation of the traditions, cultural factors and even behaviour patterns of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like so many matters relating to the environment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the processes tend to be slower than some would like to see them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately how many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reside within a 30-mile radius of the Warburton Mission in Western Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Approximately 450 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reside within a 30-mile radius of the Mission, although the number varies dramatically because of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who pass through and stay for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As in other places, very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there are on unemployment relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs received urgent messages from the  President  of the Northern Territory Legislative Council and the Legislative Council member for Alice Springs,  Mr Kilgariff,  expressing great concern at acts of violence by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, allegedly inspired by non-Aboriginal radical elements not acting in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but whose well-being they purport to promote? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that a group of young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Papunya journeyed by bus to Row Creek, which is 1 1 miles from Alice Springs, to meet the elders of the Areyonga tribe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were left at Row Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Monday morning 7 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> appeared in the Alice Springs police court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory section of my Department has arranged for  Mr John  Hunter, who has great experience and who is acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to undertake an in-depth study to see what, if anything, can be done to reduce any such incidents or prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One concerned migrants who seemed to me to be at a very great disadvantage in this community; the other concerned women who were as disadvantaged as were migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or those other people that we traditionally think of as being disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department and I agree wholeheartedly with  Mr Perkins  when he says that we should give control of the affairs of Aboriginal people to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in agreement with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who want to take over control of four other sections of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is his reference to  Senator Bonner  occupying the chair in this place during this National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation will also be introduced to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act which are contrary to the principles embodied in the Racial Discrimination Convention and in the International Covenant on Civil  and  Political <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A spokesman for the Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister  (Senator Cavanagh)  said the legislation would supersede three sections of the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act, which, he said; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will those consultations extend to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outside the Northern Territory, which was covered in the Woodward report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Woodward report stated that there should be discussions with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that no white solution would be a solution to the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already 2 lands councils, which were established on the recommendation of the first interim report of the committee, have had referred to them the question of Aboriginal land rights in respect of such matters as tribal lands and claims for residential rights, for the purpose of discussions with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reply to the question is that all registration of land, defining of areas and provision of compensation by granting land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in areas where particular land cannot be returned to them will be carried out in consultation with the Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This tendency was very clearly exhibited by  Senator Brown  recently when, while representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Senator Cavanagh,  he told a public meeting at Bairnsdale that if it had not been for pressure by a Labor Government <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might still not have the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That tendency to expound without knowledge will cost  Senator Brown  $1,000, for Victorian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got the vote in 1855. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate also is to deal with motions relating to a system of imposed regionalism and discrimination against rural industries, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, rural policy, grants to the States, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is evident that in a State where the oppression of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and restrictions on them are more severe than anywhere else, political interests are regarded as superior to the interests of the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of brief preface I refer to the fact that yesterday the Minister said in reply to a question by me that the Woodward Aboriginal Land Rights Commission report was not being discussed with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or their organisations outside the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government therefore appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the problems and advise it on: ‘The appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to rights in or in relation to land’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cash compensation in the pockets of this generation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is no answer to the legitimate land claims of a people with a distinct past who want to maintain their separate identity in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lacking proper protection? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I work with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and I treat many more than those with whom I work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we can do more for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but we can do more for honourable senators opposite, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also asked the question: Are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lacking proper protection? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also mentioned that we can do much more for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our health services can be improved just as those for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit to  Senator Baume,  that we have pockets of underprivileged people, in particular the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whose infant mortality rate is an absolute disgrace to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the infant mortality rate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is separated from the figures for the rest of the country we lie ninth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He really topped the bill with his remarks about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I work with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and I treat many more than those with whom I work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From remarks like this I would think that  Senator Shiel  practices in Utopia where there are a lot of happy <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> running around, all healthy, none disadvantaged and none dissatisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24 May 1972 the Minister for bits and pieces, as we used to call him, the Minister for  the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, the Honourable Peter Howson, apparently expressed a certain belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We took this away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would not move from their land, the friends of honourable senators opposite went in with guns and forced them out so that they could exploit the wealth of the Aboriginal lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware of Press reports that 3 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protesting at the bombing of Quail Island, which they claim is sacred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he inform the Senate what steps he intends to take to assist the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to preserve the right of their Aboriginal tribe which is making a claim regarding the sacredness of this island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time 4 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had settled on the island as a protest in order to stop further bombing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Attorney-General agree that one of the important needs in the provision of a just court system for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is the availability of an adequate number of trained Aboriginal interpreters and the training of both the legal profession and magistrates in an understanding of Aboriginal culture, law and way of life where those legal practitioners or magistrates are involved in trials involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work being done in the area of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Aboriginal land rights flows essentially from the statement which the previous Prime Minister made on Australia Day 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he cannot remember that the number is three, he should go back and get <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to help him learn to count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I draw the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to Press reports of a brawl between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and sailors in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of groups who gave evidence included city dwellers in Darwin, people from Alice Springs, people from the stations and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember well the strong arguments that were put by one group, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, that here was an opportunity to give those wonderful citizens of Australia, concentrated in greater numbers in this part of Australia than anywhere else, direct elected responsibility on the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first instance I was, on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh),  to carry out an on the spot in-depth examination of conditions that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that region were experiencing in relation to housing, education, health, and work opportunities among other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Mackellar did what he said he would do, I cannot imagine what the conditions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that region must have been like prior to his visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report shows that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that region, generally speaking, are suffering from deplorable conditions in terms of housing, education, employment opportunities and the provision of health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of a long tirade lasting about forty or fifty minutes  Senator Brown  directed his remarks mostly to the alleged failure of the previous Government to do anything for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that I proved earlier during the course of that visit that the shorter the period I spoke and the longer opportunity I gave for questions the more fruitful was it for my own edification and from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that  Senator Brown  had been incorrect about when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Brown  had said that that if it had not been for Labor Party pressure <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would not have had the vote a few years ago when they did receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Brown  replied by saying: ‘Look, if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had a vote in 1908 I will give $1,000 to any charity you like to name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1855 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got the vote in Victoria so  Senator Brown  was a little bit out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have confirmed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have had the vote since 1855 in the State of Victoria and logically from 1901 for Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have confirmed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been voting in State and Federal elections since 1855. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would appreciate your urgent attention to this matter as it involves a question of your personal honesty and integrity with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of East Gippsland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly contains no reference to any comment by me about where or when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not receive a vote in Victoria and/or Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is true that I did make some comments and did say that the most we could hope to do in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today was to make some recompense for what had been done to them by our forebears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comments I was making in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not related only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was speaking of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the sense of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia and relating my comments to a universal adult franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only were the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> dispossessed of the adult franchise throughout Australia and as between States but so also were Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to go into detail and, if it is so wished, I am happy to table a document prepared by the Education and Welfare Group of the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library relating to the voting rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in State and Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to Victoria the document points out that since the inception of the Constitution of the State of Victoria in 1855 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been entitled to enrol and vote in that State although neither enrolment nor voting became compulsory until 1962. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 will not weary honourable senators with particulars concerning all the other States, but I asked for a summary of the voting rights in each State, including Victoria, and the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with respect to the franchise for national elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>REQUEST: Further information on Voting Rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few if any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would have been able to meet the qualifications of an elector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions would have excluded many of the less wealthy sections of the population of Victoria (including many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>) from entitlement to vote in Council elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This information is worth recording because it will be seen how the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been dispossessed of an entitlement which others enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1 926 all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in New South Wales have been entitled to be enrolled and to vote in State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1965 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have been able to vote for members of the Legislative Assembly in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Western Australia: Before 1962 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with more than 25 per cent Aboriginal blood could not vote unless (s)he held a certificate of citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1962 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia have had the same voting rights at State Elections as other residents of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>South Australia: <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have had the same voting privileges as other British subjects, provided that they are domiciled in a particular sub-division for one month as is required of other electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Northern Territory: Before 1962 most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory were debarred from voting in elections in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1962 all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have had the same voting rights as British subjects, except that enrolment and voting is not compulsory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were (under the Victorian Constitution of 1855) not excluded from voting in Council and Assembly elections, certain restrictions (requiring electors to be owners, lessees or occupying tenants of property of certain stated values) would have debarred many sections of the population including between 80,000-250,000 gold diggers and presumably many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, from the right to vote in State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before 1962 only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> entitled to vote in State elections and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had served or were serving in the defence forces could vote in Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1962 all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Australia have had the right to vote in Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no reference in the newspaper report to my saying anything about where or when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> received a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made reference to the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had not even been looked upon as being human beings to be counted in the total population of Victoria until more recent years, and I referred to the fact that their voting rights were only of recent years in terms of adult franchise, particularly in regard to national elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Skuta,  who is very active in the Gippsland area for which she is the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee member, sent me a frightening report about the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area, mostly in regard to health, housing and welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That State has the smallest population of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of all the mainland States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Commonwealth, through my Department, made grants to the Victorian Government for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before I return to the subject of the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria I want to raise a couple of points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take umbrage at what  Mr Nixon  said when, in his remarks,  Mr Nixon  asserted that, like his predecessor, or those who went before him, the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had gone to this area, promised the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> housing, but they had received no housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of  Senator Brown’s  visit we may have done more for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a previous occasion there was a complaint that the local police and a few others had taken alcohol into the reserve for the purpose of inciting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to engage in a lynching party against  Mr Phillip  Nitszhe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In it there are aged people, single persons, frail persons, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, chronically ill people and people who enjoy a good state of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have to enrol and many workers in the Pilbara do not choose to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have recently, by enfranchising <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, moved to equal representation of all races. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that since coming to office this Government has sought consistently to remove all forms of discrimination from our laws, whether it be discrimination against women, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants or in the various other forms that it appears in our statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not told us whether we will there have a true one vote one value or how <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that it is a significant and growing electorate in which there are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia have benefited from the actions of a recent Minister- not the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs- who went around Australia distributing Government largesse in millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said it was to advance the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would have wanted to advance the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but, at the same time, he let those who followed him say with some conviction: ‘Take away this Government, change the Government, and the largesse which you are receiving will not be available to you any longer’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory who wish to have their names included on the electoral roll? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When I answered a question on this matter on 1 August 1974, I stated that there was no truth at all in the suggestion that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Wattie Creek were on the verge of starvation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is known, I would think, that the Department of Social Security stopped the payment of unemployment benefits to 3 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Wattie Creek reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> no longer complied with the requirements of the work test which one must meet to receive unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department has not reduced the funds made available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the report in question was circulated, we authorised the accountant in Darwin who was holding $9,000 for the purchase of a truck to release that sum to the Wattie Creek <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that they had collected some food for the Wattie Creek <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and asked the Department to forward that food to Wattie Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point I make in this respect is that we did not know whether the food was of the type that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area would eat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly we thought that food, more acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, could be made available if we paid the cost of freight to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as a result of the sympathy for the Gurindji people at Wattie Creek the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there receive more attention and, possibly, assistance than any other comparable group in the same circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister apply pressure to the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs to ensure that that Department sets up a proper apprenticeship training program for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on all Queensland reserves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of adult award wages for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland is one for the State to solve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will take up with him whether we can pay a differential wage to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to bring their wages up to the wages paid to other inhabitants of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also understand that the 1974 Annual Report will include the results of a survey of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-82-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question by reminding the Minister that 7 homes are being built for Aboriginal families at Laura in North Queensland to a totally unsuitable design for the tropics and are built on a site away from that chosen by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are involved in the administration of justice, of course, in the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service which is administered by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Senator Cavanagh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is firmly committed to the involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the administration of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A scheme is being evolved in the Northern Territory for the training of police cadets of whom it is expected that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be a prominent section, and also of police liaison assistants to act as interpreters and in other roles in the administration of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will see the statement that some 922 houses are needed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that at 3 p.m. the Senate will proceed to discuss General Business in the following order: Firstly, the notice of motion by  Senator Bonner  relating to the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders; secondly, the notice of motion by  Senator Primmer  for the Senate to take note of the Green Paper on rural policy in Australia; and, thirdly, the notice of motion by  Senator Rae  for the re-appointment of the Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government from obtaining the right to mine because of the Government ‘s policy in relation to the protection of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, by reason of the facts set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the statement of claim, he alleges that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had a relationship with the whole continent of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were entitled to all benefits obtained from the land and to take part in any decisions which might be made about the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators read  Senator Bonner’s  motion carefully they will find, it seems to me, that he is saying that the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to 1788 and the First Fleet landing at Botany Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I gave notice of this motion on 1 1 July 1974 1 felt that it was quite appropriate as it was National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Week- a week supposedly set aside for the recognition of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a week during which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to celebrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not deny that the present Government, in many areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, has instigated superbly beneficial schemes to improve my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and Torres Strait Islanders’ way of life within our broader Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely no one can deny that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were dispossessed of what was theirs by right of inheritance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does any honourable senator in this chamber dispute the findings of eminent anthropologists that the indigenous people, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation for thousands of years prior to 1788? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there are among honourable senators here those who will cry out in dismay and disbelief at the wording of this motion because just who among us but me, one of the remnants of the noble tribes who once walked with pride in the fact that this glorious and wonderful land was theirs, will be able to look at this through the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I asking <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to throw off their chains and unite? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I saying: ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, pack a gun and go out on the streets’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I saying: ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, down with the whiteys’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I also have a vision- a vision in which I see all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders walking tall in the knowledge that their dignity has been restored by their learning that what was once ours has been recognised as ours but forcibly taken and now compensated for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does one expect to pay the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for Australia at the going rate at the time of the First Fleet landing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am asking for an amount of money to be set aside from the annual national Budget which will become the true entitlement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders so that we may recapture our dignity and our pride as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because charity is being given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or to the Islanders or, as some people term it, to the boongs, the Abos or the blacks; but my God, forgetting that these very same boongs, Abos and blacks inherited this vast nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President and honourable senators, I say that the day is fast approaching when this compensation for dispossession of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders must- I say ‘must’- be channelled to an all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander statutory body empowered to administer such a compensation for dispossession fund, for the survival of fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Senate to accept the fact that the indigenous people of Australia who are now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, and I urge the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and to introduce legislation to compensate annually the people who are now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land- rather than conquerors ‘ charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, by referring to a statement in the Queensland ‘Courier Mail’ newspaper of 21 September 1974, which was attributed to  Senator Cavanagh,  the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, concerning the Australian Government’s intended acquisition of some 7,500,000 acres of land currently reserved by the Queensland Government for use by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that we are in unity to see that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get those land rights in Queensland, as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in every other State of Australia will receive them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a method of acquiring land from a reluctant Premier who will not give land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland should not be worse off, by virtue of the fact that they have a Premier elected by a minority vote, than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in other parts of the country who live in States in which there is properly elected majority rule in the State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall give to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland- I hope with  Senator Bonner’s  supportthe same rights as they have in every other State of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government now provides free artificial limbs to everyone in the community, using the facilities of the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres, what assistance is given to Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> suffering limb deformities as a result of leprosy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to say that one of the consequences of the extension of repatriation services into the field of the provision of artificial limbs has been that this service has been extended to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, many of whom were suffering very greatly because of leprosy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artificial limbs are now available free of charge to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as they are available to all other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Repatriation and Compensation, in conjunction with the Department of Health, has provided a centre in Darwin where artificial limbs are made available to all those who are in need of them, particularly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not invited or allowed to join the Panel by our predecessors in government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly I must say, as a Queenslander, that while I welcome assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I cannot think of anything more frightening or more lamentable than the events of the last few days in relation to statements by the Federal Government as to its intentions towards the Queensland Government on the issue of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More of that income will be taken and devoted to spending on education, health, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a directive been given to the Northern Territory police to refrain from arresting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on charges of drunkenness and disorderly behaviour arising from that condition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a responsible Budget because the Government has put its money where its mouth is as far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned, spending $164m in this financial year, the greatest amount ever allocated to help our indigenous people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the letter questioned each decision that the Board made and the participation of Torres Strait Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the decisions that Applied Ecology had to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Commonwealth acquired power over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1967 it has been the desire to find them useful employment wherever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those regions to which industry cannot be attracted it has been difficult to find employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board had a system of holding meetings on the islands, and this system was justified last evening as being in an endeavour to involve the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the Torres Strait Islanders in the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to recent Press reports that a ban has been placed on the export of historical documents relating to arrangements made between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and explorers or early settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man was a middle-aged Aboriginal and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, incidentally, suffer more than white prisoners who, according to statements made to me, have suffered as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were getting a worse time than most other members of the community and I repeat that with emphasis mostly for the benefit of  Sir Magnus  Cormack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion we granted $34,000 in funds to employ 18 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on a special works project during the last financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now received from the Murray Bridge Corporation a further application for a special works allocation of $37,400 to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during the financial year 1 974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will ensure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland are not disadvantaged by this decision and it believes that, because the Australian Government’s approach is to involve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the maximum extent possible in matters affecting them, this decision will ensure greater benefit in the long term to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the policies of the Australian Government in respect of Aboriginal people might be described as seeking: to encourage and strengthen the capacity of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to manage their own affairs and to increase their economic independence; to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have a real freedom of choice about their life style and the extent to which, particularly in the more remote communities, they maintain their traditional customs and culture- a freedom which can be exercised to the extent that communities have local authority, in particular through land ownership; to make equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians by working to overcome those handicaps which generally face them in fields such as housing, health, education, employment and civil liberties; in doing this, to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to provide services designed to overcome handicapsfor instance, through Aboriginal housing societies, medical services and legal services- and to act in the closest consultation with Aboriginal communities and individuals at both the national and the local levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always regarded the provision of services such as health, housing, education, employment, legal aid and others to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as being the responsibility of functional departments and authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is to stimulate and support the extension or the accommodation of existing services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to ensure that special services and programs are provided for Aboriginal people where necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to replace the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968, under which the capital fund for aboriginal enterprises was established, by an Act providing means of making loans to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> both for enterprises as in the past, and for housing and for personal purposes as denned in section 24. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended that both funds be controlled and administered by an Aboriginal loans commission comprising a board of 5 commissioners, at least 2 of whom are required in the legislation to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Enterprises Fund continues the scheme established in 1968 whereby the capital fund for aboriginal enterprises may make loans to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders to start or develop business enterprises which have prospects of success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed initially to appoint two or three leading financiers and businessmen, as well as at least 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to the board of commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that it is impossible to overcome the health problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> while there is a lack of housing and while there are cramped conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that in many areas vitamin C tablets or special foods will supply a vitamin C diet to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that the Premier of Queensland and the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs are using Australian Government funds, made available to that State for housing, to exploit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that homes bought with Commonwealth funds in recent years for $10,000 to $12,000 are now available for sale to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at current market values, which indicates that the Queensland Government is making a profit of up to 100 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conditions for Aboriginal housing are that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must live in the houses and if a sale is effected, whether it is to an Aboriginal or otherwise, another house must be made available out of the grant for the purpose of housing an Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is thought to be any exploitation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in purchases of property, I shall try to take it up with the Queensland Minister, although there are some difficulties in taking anything up with the Queensland Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The break-up is roughly according to the needs of the States and to the numbers of persons in the various States who are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or are of Aboriginal descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland, by the 197 1 census, has 34 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia, other than in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that would have been a proper pro rata division of the funds, having in mind the percentage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> resident in Queensland who would benefit from this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland so that they will not be disadvantaged as a result of the action taken by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At an estimates committee meeting neither the Minister nor his officers were able to give any evidence, nor is there any evidence known to me otherwise, which would indicate that the expansion of the housing associations in Queensland in the current year will be sufficiently rapid to ensure that the full funds which will be made available for housing can be properly expended in the coming year to the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do regard as relevant to debate and to consider are complaints such as the complaint made by the Cooperative for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Ltd in a Press statement dated 4 October 1974 of which the heading is Government Failure to Sponsor Aborigine Education in Co-operatives a “Turtle Scandal in Reverse” ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The almost total failure of the Federal Government to raise a finger to promote the co-operative movement amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a public scandal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in Opposition, Government members pledged themselves to promote intensively co-operative education Ibr <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, yet once in office, they have comfortably forgotten all about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement said that the Government “s scandalous indifference was further compounded inside the Australian Co-operative movement itself where the crucial issue of cooperatives for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was not even on the agenda of the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to some of the other remarks of  Senator Everett,  I think they can be judged by his knowledge of the size of the population of Tasmania who are classified as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister, on a recent visit to the Northern Territory, say that he would like to see a program broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to cater for the needs of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was formerly a member of the Senate Select Committee on Social Environment which investigated the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned the problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> exist they are our responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I am having cross-fire with a Minister who is willing to say under some circumstances that the Labor Government’s policy in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country has been a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He condemns the attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that there are sections of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that there are pockets of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other low socio-economic sections of our community but honourable senators will see this in many countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be united in this protest to see that discrimination ceases in Australia also- both in respect of the legislation passed in Western Australia and in respect of the Country Party’s attitude particularly to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators want to see the greatest discrimination in Australia we have it in the Queensland Parliament against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the laws of the land, whereby <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are on enclosed settlements, white men cannot go there without the permission of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the advocacy of  Senator Webster  will justify his voting for our Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> anti-discrimination Bill when it comes before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Misstatements have been made about the tying up of a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in one settlement in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Redfern, where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> mostly live, there is a row of attached houses which not a government but an Aboriginal community purchased and is in the process of renovating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those attached houses will be occupied by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not blocking <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> away on their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time we have some self-determination by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a group of a few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who want to continue disputation between the Department and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but this view is not shared by the Aboriginal community- and I have met many thousands of ordinary <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over the last fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the Australian public is inclined to accept those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who carry on such demonstrations as representative of all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the near future we intend trying to acquaint the Australian public with the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the most peaceful, pacifist and likeable people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister of newspaper reports that some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who protested outside Parliament House last week had not arranged return transport to their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: After the demonstration were any of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lodged in accommodation in Canberra at government expense? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the demonstration were any of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sent to the South Coast of New South Wales in taxis at government expense? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-To the best of my knowledge, no government expense at all was involved in the demonstration, other than I believe that a car from the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service was used to bring demonstrators from Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is objection to the apartheid policies of South Africa it ought to be recognised that this Government is pursuing the same sort of Bantustan policies with regard to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an assembly place for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the metropolitan area and for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> coming from the country areas to the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to go to the Council’s rescue previously when the State Government could give nothing to provide accommodation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were then living in the Townsville bandstand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the joint announcement by the Minister and the Western Australian Minister for Community Welfare on 10 November 1974 and that a further $lm from the 1974-75 grant could be devoted to further village development by and for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Houses were going up at the rate of one a month and were completely constructed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The keenness of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to get their homes constructed was such that they were asking why, since they got up at 4 o ‘clock in the morning, they could not start at 4 o ‘clock and get the houses finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have an affinity with the land and it is their tribal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persons who occupy these tents claim to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one rule for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and there is one rule for other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy to emphasise and concentrate on the problems of some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who want to demonstrate, show their feelings and publicise them by putting up some tents outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he deals with some failure of administration by the AttorneyGeneral the great example he picks on is some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who put up tents outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the worth of the contribution of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition can be gauged in this way: He is preoccupied in ensuring that, as I have said, the might of the Australian legal system is levelled against a few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of recent problems that the Minister has encountered in obtaining properly audited statements of expenditure from the Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales, can the Minister inform the Senate whether he has encountered similar problems with the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had great cooperation from and satisfaction with the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service which is operating throughout Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad basis of that agreement was that the Australian Legal Aid Office now established in Tasmania, in Burnie and in Hobart and soon to be established in Launceston, would handle matters which arose under Federal law and also matters in which the Australian Government considered that it had a special responsibility, such as in relation to ex-servicemen, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What appears to have been overlooked by the Government is the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not wish to be in any way taken as suggesting that they should not be encouraged to become fully operative as soon as possible, and subject to certain comments which my colleague  Senator Bonner  will make and which I do not pause to make but do support about the question of costs that are involved and therefore the net amount which eventually will become available for housing and other benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the fact is that last year some $9m was unexpended in relation to Aboriginal housing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are geared up to be able to make sure that the utmost advantage is taken of the provision of funds by the Commonwealth in the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my speech I had quoted some comments which had been made in a news release put out on behalf of the Co-operative for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Ltd. As I mentioned then that news release was highly critical of the present Government’s failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the history of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is not such as would give people confidence in its having greater capacity than the Queensland Department to act in the best interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent events only heighten the concern of those who have doubts about the capacity of the Department at the moment efficiently to act in the best interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one which is disquieting in relation to the administration of Aboriginal affairs in Australia and one which does not make for any greater confidence that the Commonwealth Department is more capable automatically than Queensland in administering for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind all these things and the matters which I mentioned earlier about the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, I read from an editorial in the ‘Courier-Mail’ of 18 October which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can be certain at this stage whether Queensland’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want Commonwealth or State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I move an amendment to the motion for the second reading and to draw attention to the attitude of the Senate in relation to this action of the Government because we believe that it should forthwith make this money available to the Queensland Government so that it can be spent expeditiously in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He criticised the fact that there has been a decrease in the housing allocation provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On at least 2 occasions in the last 2 financial years fairly large sums of money have remained unexpended in Queensland when they should have been made available for the purchase or construction of homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of these problems come back to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1972 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised a question in this House a few weeks ago in relation to expenditure on housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who eventually hoped that they would be able to purchase the homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is doubly hard for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who almost invariably come within the lowest income group and frequently have to provide for a family larger than average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in Queensland who are getting a rake-off, apart from the State Government, at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw a contract recently concerning premises to be made available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in which an estate agent was apparently getting the rip-off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two groups of people have to be protected in this community; firstly, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and secondly, the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are groups of people in the community who are getting a rip-off at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find that a whole host of them are being held up at the registration level, so in a direct way the State Government again is stepping in to deprive <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not helping the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to be consulted at every level and they ought to be involved in the decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that in very difficult circumstances  Senator Cavanagh  is doing the very best that he possibly can on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, so put that in your pipe and smoke it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the fact that it is said that there is a so-called advisory council in Queensland, the majority of members of that council have been hand picked in various ways by white people in the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs to make sure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say ‘Yes, boss’ every time that a proposal is put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it has been said that there are now loopholes in the Act- if one wishes to describe them as such- which allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be in charge of their own affairs; and a number of them are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surprisingly, to those people who favour the Acts, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> handle their own affairs much better than white people handled their affairs for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a responsibility on this Government to clean up the mess left by years of maladministration at government level and at the Commonwealth level so far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our ambitions are to see <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> running their own affairs to some degree in the short term- as soon as possibleand totally in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not want one house situated where the Queensland Department built them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Queensland Department expended the best part of $250,000 of Australian Government funds to build houses, firstly, where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not want them and, secondly, in an area where they will probably have to be shifted because of the type of earth or sand in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had taken notice of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we would have built houses in an area where they wanted them, where the ground formation would have been good, where they would have been able to have a garden and where they would have been able to live happily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shift the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by force from their grounds and put them on a hill- a stoney hill- under the dominance of the white man who is on top of the hill so he can look down on his black subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the white masters of the day the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might have damaged themselves if they had left the power switched on overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They made a deal over the heads of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and they were the real hookworm in that settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will be the effects of this decision on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his Budget the Treasurer provided an amount of $13,552,000 so that in effect  Senator Cavanagh  proposes reducing Queensland’s allocation by $3,190,000 in spite of commitments in writing given by him and his Department as well as consultation at officer level which indicated the amount as being for housing for Queensland ‘s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am greatly concerned over this action by  Senator Cavanagh  as it has now become necessary for me to have my Department carry out an exhaustive investigation of total fundings which at this stage appears to require a drastic reduction in the housing programme activity which must be disastrous not only for the building industry generally in the State, but as well dash the hopes of so many Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for an early relief of their housing problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is futile for the  Senator to  claim that he proposes reallocating the money so that Queensland ‘s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not be disadvantaged when he is fully aware that his Bill reallocates the amount to other Slates and also that during the past financial year his Department underspent by $9m in the housing section alone, as indicated in the Treasurer’s Budget Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the nature of the visit and is it causing further disruption and unrest among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the visit is designed primarily to endeavour to create unrest and disharmony amongst Aboriginal people, and I would forecast also for party political purposes in view of the election, but especially as a result of a particularly vitriolic attack on him and his department by a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in North Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I very much regret having to foreshadow his intent as I have at all times endeavoured to encourage both the Commonwealth Government and others to refrain using <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as political ‘footballs’ and political pawns’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until he became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, he probably was never out of a city or into the spinifex and seen <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in real life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure honourable members would be interested in hearing the attitude of a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as conveyed in a telegram on October 22 to  Senator Cavanagh,  a copy of which has been made available to me:- ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been pointed out, Queensland has one-third of the total number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia, and the Queensland Government has been housing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> pretty well in many areas which I know pretty well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to state quite clearly that we want to see that we get the money for housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that  Senator Cavanagh  will get some better advice from some of his Queensland advisers or else change his advisers so that we can get on with the job of housing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless other people are prepared to talk to him and to do what they are told he will take their money away from them so that he will get credit for what the Australian Government is doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge the Commonwealth Government had the responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland, as has been stated before, has the largest number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of any State in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are approximately 60,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland some 27,000 to 30,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are known to live on government communities or mission stations and are regarded as assisted <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government in Queensland, over a number of years, has accepted responsibility for these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the extent that it provides for these communities in every field- education, health, housing, the whole box and dice of what is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the balance between the 27,000 to 30,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on government communities or mission stations and the 60,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland- that is the 30,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who do not live on Aboriginal communities- are not being catered for by any government- the Commonwealth Government, the State Government or the present Australian Government, as it calls itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of this amount the Queensland Government, through the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, has provided a very substantial number of houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not always done what I thought it should have done or what other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> thought it should have done in relation to Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far be it from me, as an Aborigine, to reject the involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the only people who lose out are the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland will miss out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been committed to the extent that the Department, from now to June next year, will not be in the market for the purchase of houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over and above the money provided in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that does not show to all and sundry that the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs is trying to do a good job by providing as many houses as possible for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland then I am a Dutchman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  they wish to give their children the same opportunities that you, I and everybody else wish to give our children, but the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> still have this desire to go back on occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said on so many occasions, it is about time that the Department started to employ and involve competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear so much from the Government of its aim to involve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the decision making process in the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what greater way can we involve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in decision making than in that Department, which has the responsibility for Aboriginal administration throughout the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until such time as a building is provided in the capital of this nation, which used to be their nation, where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Will have a permanent lobby, they have every right to do what they are doing today in front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the time is fast approaching when we will have to set up- I do not care what you call it, a commission or whatever- a statutory body which is completely administered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and responsible to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the expertise in Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland has approximately onethird of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia and for many years has received approximately one-third of the revenue granted to the States for the care of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland remonstrated about this and the Minister, apparently realising the extent of his act of discrimination against the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, suddenly decided that he could pull $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be described as anything less than an act of discrimination against Queensland ‘s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because they are the ones who will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it had a lot of plans that it put to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and asked how they would like to be represented in the new Northern Territory legislative assembly and sought thenviews on different electorates, different candidates and different methods of electing members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a man on all those reserves the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rejected those plans saying: ‘That would be discriminating in favour of the black man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you discriminate in favour of us you are discriminating against the non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was proud of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the way they decided that they just wanted to be Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can move to and fro on those reserves quite freely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that I think the rules allowing one to belong to the ALP are a lot more stringent than any that apply to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has that to do with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he would find, to his joy, that Queensland has the best administration for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that they are happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought we were dealing with the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland rather than the Queensland Government which  Senator Rae  is supporting in his amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes sought are a good deal less than sweeping, but they do cover some of the areas which understandably have brought charges of undue control over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations want it made clear that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders have complete freedom to manage their own property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is amazing that everything is well in Queensland with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of Queensland is said to have been the salvation of the Aboriginal population, yet on 25 October the anti-Labor ‘Courier Mail’ was pressing the Queensland Government to introduce drastic amendments to the Act in the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was about to relate to the Senate what was stated in the hearings of Estimates Committee G. I said that  Senator Rae  had no interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on that occasion but that  Senator Sheil  did, and I give him great credit for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we came in here this afternoon to hear  Senator Rae,  who never asked the Minister or the officials of the Department one question about this matter, try with all the sanctity in the world to condemn the Minister for, in effect, trying to by-pass the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland in relation to their financial entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an amazing thing that they denigrate the Australian Government for what it has done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later in the hearings of Estimates Committee G, when again dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>,  Senator Cavanagh  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all enamoured of the idea of $40m being made available as quickly as possible to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that there are sections of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to hear from you on that matter because you said that I was totally wrong about the block of houses at Redfern for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Misstatements have been made about the tying up of a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in one settlement in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Redfern, where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> mostly live, there is a row of attached houses which not a government but an Aboriginal community purchased and is in the process of renovating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government should stop and rethink its policy relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or it will be doing as it has done in so many other areasstopping, rethinking and doing an about face on policies, as it did on overseas investment and profits for companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter when I first saw an Aborigine or what I knew about them then and notwithstanding what is indicated in the documents of the Queensland Minister, tabled by  Senator Lawrie,  after some 1 3 months in charge of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs working with a department that is knowledgeable in Aboriginal affairs, and after the miles I have travelled and the thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I have met, I now have some cognisance of Aboriginal thinking, Aboriginal people and Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he says, the greatest consideration should not be this ‘I will take my bat home ‘ attitude, it should be the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of our saying what Queensland or anyone else should do; it is what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland never spent its grant in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So while admitting that Queensland overspent on housing, and this extra amount would be deducted from this year’s allocation for housing, Queensland never spent all the money made available by the Australian Government for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These associations have either purchased or built a number of houses in Queensland for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> finally to get the 74 houses and establish an Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the same rights as the honourable senator’s relatives have of purchasing a property and saying that they want to live in the homestead on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been a cheap source of labour on cattle stations, on peanut farms and other Country Party activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I released a Press report because I had heard that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been driven off the station as Nabalco Pty Ltd held the mining lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we went to Normanton we saw how the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lived in barricades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have no ablution facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Normanton about 8 houses have been built for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have illustrated the life of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants to overcome the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Racial Discrimination Bill 1974 introduced by  Senator Murphy  is aimed at overcoming the differences between whites and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in some respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates the fight that we are having to improve the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because a Government of the Opposition’s kind is in office in Queensland, Opposition senators would condemn the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act was enacted by this Parliament, and its objective was to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia to obtain financial assistance from a central fund, provided out of public moneys, upon terms which are not the normal commercial terms but which are those likely to assist people to be able to engage in business enterprises which have a reasonable prospect of success and in respect of which people should be entitled to receive assistance on appropriate terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague,  Senator Bonner,  has said to me there are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia who would very much like to be able to have the opportunity to obtain a loan upon reasonable terms to improve their houses, their furnishings and their opportunity for some of the material benefits of life, but who do not want to have a handout and be simply getting something for nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Attorney-General agree that one of the important needs in the provision of a just court system for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is the availability of an adequate number of trained Aboriginal interpreters and the training of both the legal profession and magistrates in an understanding of Aboriginal culture, law and way of life where those legal practitioners or magistrates are involved in trials involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can now inform the honourable senator and the Senate that I have long recognised the need for a greater involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the law enforcement processes of both mainland Territories and, in particular, of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended that additional appointments of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as Special Magistrates be made progressively after consideration of the needs of particular areas of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Public Service Board has approved a proposal for the employment of 12 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as police liaison assistants to be attached to 6 of the larger police stations in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their duties will be to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are brought into the police station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the assistants will not have any police powers they will act as interpreters; they will endeavour to ensure that persons brought into the station understand the charges laid against them and will generally attend to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in police custody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I cannot speak for lawyers in the private sector of the profession in the Territory, I have no doubt that they too see the need to understand and appreciate the problems confronting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> appearing before the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator and the Senate may be assured that I will endeavour to see that the States adopt similar measures to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their dealings with the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say it would be passed with a sweeping majority, as the referendum relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was passed, with a majority of 95 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to supersede certain provisions of the laws of Queensland that discriminate against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and deny them basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years most discriminatory legislation against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 1 May 1970  Senator Keeffe  received a letter from the then Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Wentworth,  in relation to the Queensland legislation observing that, as a result of the 1967 referendum, the Commonwealth had concurrent legislative power with the States regarding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Minister stated that the Commonwealth and the States had been discussing discriminatory and special legislation for some years, and that in the previous decade major changes had been made in all State Acts relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a subsequent answer to a parliamentary question,  Mr Wentworth  identified the Queensland legislation with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders as being ‘prima facie discriminatory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is pledged to remove all discriminatory legislation against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the end of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw honourable senators’ attention to the policy platforms of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party on the issue of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The federal platform of the Liberal Party, as approved by the Federal Council in October 1974, includes proposals for the implementation and enforcement of legislation to promote equality of rights between all Australian citizens and to remove any form of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20 November 1973, the Prime Minister sent a further teleprinter message to the Premier of Queensland pointing out that, in addition to the provisions with respect to property management, there were other features of the Queensland legislation with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders that were unsatisfactory from a civil liberties’ viewpoint, including provisions relating to liberty of movement to enter a reserve, legal representation before and appeal from Aboriginal courts, and relating to compulsory labour and conformity to a code of conduct on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the amendments leave intact provisions that authorise the continued management under the present legislation of property managed without the consent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders under earlier Queensland legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the contention of the Queensland Government that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland do not desire any further amendments to the Queensland law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, for example, that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders are unable to visit their relations on reserves unless they apply for, and are granted, a permit to enter the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this provision is to supersede such provisions as regulation 1 4 of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Regulations, in its application to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which provides that a person authorised to be on a reserve shall conduct himself properly and to the satisfaction of the Aboriginal council and manager or district officer of a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders in Queensland are not to be employed on terms and conditions of employment that are less favourable than those applicable to other employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland laws with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders contain provisions relating to the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in accordance with the provisions of awards, but these provisions only apply outside a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision only applies to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and does not apply generally to persons in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill are not intended to replace the whole of the Queensland legislation with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee inquired into the arrangements made in 1971-72 by the Northern Territory Administration for the purchase and delivery of 34 demountable houses to be erected for occupation by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at three aboriginal settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last month there would be few communities in Queensland to which I have not spoken and explained what the Government intends to do in regard to the law affecting Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason I entered this debate tonight was because I was disgusted to hear honourable senators oppositethe people who allegedly support the Aboriginal people- denigrate in the Senate chamber tonight a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They denigrated these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by saying that they could be coerced by the Premier of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have the audacity to say that they support <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and they want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was been Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for almost 18 months, but 2 weeks before an election he goes to Queensland and starts tossing money around so that he can buy some votes from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only  Senator Keeffe, Senator Cavanagh  and  Senator McLaren  have that kind of intelligence; <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that the letters of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on the communities are opened and censored is not correct today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all the cries that come from the other side of the chamber about self-determination and all that sort of jazz, it seems strange that over the years there have been only three, or two, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so far who have been elected to any parliament in Australia- myself here for the Liberal Party, and a chap in the Northern Territory <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner has on occasions made requests for grants on behalf of organisations in Queensland to assist them in improving the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that it has been in good faith, because of his interest in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that he has asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether I would be accused of trying to buy votes by acceding to  Senator Bonner’s  request never entered my head, nor did it enter my head that such an accusation would be made in the Torres Strait Islands where I was trying to improve the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that everything the Government does which is of benefit to someone could be alleged to be buying votes, but the Government- through my portfolio in particularhas a responsibility to advance the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it is for the purpose of giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland the same rights as the white settlers in Queensland; it is for the purpose of giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves in Queensland the same rights as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> off reserves in Queensland, and it is in keeping with an obligation we have to a United Nations agreement that we are obliged to proceed with this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has the interests of Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at heart will vote for the Bill when it comes before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to his many attempts to have discussions with the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs in relation to land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other matters such as those raised by  Senator Bonner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a false accusation that the Commonwealth wants to stop <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from having the right to say who goes on their reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we give reserves to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on those reserves as an entitlement to land rights the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the same right as has any owner of private property to say who goes on or off their reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article goes on to level some rather strong criticism at the Minister and his Department for lack of interest in the appalling conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are forced to live in that town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister cause an immediate investigation to be made into the conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living at Wilcannia with the aim of having something done immediately in their favour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for disease and the living conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we have had representations from New South Wales doctors who have said that medical science is hopeless unless we can improve housing conditions and the nutrition of people in Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  has been criticised for patronage because he is improving the lot of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a joint view that the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland should be served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of any evidence to suggest that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want the withdrawal of this restriction, and when there is a very strong prima facie case that they do not want it to be withdrawn but prefer to retain the protection which they regard that it gives to them, it is our view that this Government is not acting in their best interests in proceeding with this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He finalised his remarks by claiming that the Government was adopting a Big Brother, socialist attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and suggested that a poll be conducted on the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has adopted the attitude that in every way possible <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will make their own decisions anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae  is claiming that by conducting some sort of poll on some specious grounds he is going to solve all the problems that he and his race have created insofar as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not want it debated yesterday when the proceedings of the Senate were being broadcast because the things that they have to say are politically unacceptable to the public at large and to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he was one of those who came into this chamber and supported the then Minister for the Interior,  Mr Ralph  Hunt, when he was able to get something like 60 to 80 police over there with guns and batons and belt the blacks into the ground so that the lawns were not green but red with the blood of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man, who now claims to be a great humanitarian, stood in this chamber and supported the bashing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outside this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a basher of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from way back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants to keep the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under subjection and he has no other way of getting around it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He supported the attitude of the then Minister for the Interior in carrying on his bashing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outside of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost half the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland live away from the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a copy here of a Bill which is entitled ‘A Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971, each in certain particulars’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I detest the word myself because we are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Minister whilst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living in the community now, as councillors of the community, they should not have the right to stop people from going in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in his Bill, wants to take that right away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one breath the Minister brings in a Bill to say that the Aboriginal councillors should not have this right and then he sends a telegram to say that when he takes over in Queensland the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have the right to say who enters their reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill is out of date already but, more particularly, it ignores the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to note that it applies only to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that the Queensland Act applies only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders who live in the communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are about 30,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland and only 10,000 live in the communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act has been worked out in consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier has offered to amend or abolish any clauses which it may be deserved to be amended or abolished on the advice of the councils, which is vastly different from how things were when Labor was administering the Act which was known to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as the ‘Dog Act’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders in Queensland is one of quiet development which is both harmonious and progressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he claimed that the Act authorised management of property of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders without their consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixthly, he said there is a discriminatory right of certain people to enter the premises of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders without their consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, management of property has always been undertaken only when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were incapable of managing their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They often involve alcohol, and many are related to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ or Islanders’ own tribal laws and customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> regard these communities as their homes, and it is perfectly normal for them to require a code of conduct, just as we do in our homes and just as we do in the Senate with our own Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister stated that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are paid less if they are aged, infirm or slow workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a means of encouraging <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from being an act of discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Queensland Act discriminates in favour of them, which is in accord with the Schedule of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Act does this, and it does it effectively and with the active co-operation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders are free to enter and leave the communities at any time, at their own wish and according to their own rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has greatly reduced the problem that Aboriginesand Islanders, to some extent- have with alcohol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Street, Brisbane now, and from the sale of produce from cattle stations, such as the one at Woorabinda, which are run by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, are all paid into an Aboriginal trust fund which is used for both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are in evidence amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the care of the Commonwealth Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth at the moment is handing out money to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> without requiring any civic responsibility of them at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this dauntless disciple of racial discrimination, with his Department divided, his radicals ridiculing him and the children under his care starving, presumes to discredit Queensland’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders, the Queensland legislation and the Queensland Premier with a Bill that is nothing more than deceit and duplicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he not noticed the vote of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the recent Northern Territory election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been pointed out- I do not want to go into the question of Mapoon- that in an effort to obtain an expression of opinion from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I travelled all over Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it cannot be said that I have not been to see the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that I have not discussed this matter with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of that was to obtain an indication of the opinion of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland on the question of what they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner would know full well that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in favour of my proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tents were erected on the lawns of the city square in Brisbane by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> demanding the repeal of the Queensland Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entry of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> onto reserves is a vital issue that involves the right of the people who came from such reserves and who are not on them now to return to their tribal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on settlements in Queensland are an impediment which is preventing us from becoming part of an international effort to solve an international problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition wants the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland to decide this vital issue of whether we should play our part in relation to the indigenous people of the oppressed countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of which department is most fitted to deal with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their political interest is greater than their humanitarian interest in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want to be exposed for what they are by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland so they have sought to adjourn this matter sine die, knowing that that would be the death knell of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sheil  thinks that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are so stupid that they will say yes to one person and no to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is his opinion of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that we have to give to a greater degree in Queensland than in other States in order to overcome the lack of activity to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It removes restrictions imposed upon <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under Queensland laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It supersedes the Queensland laws that descriminate against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill applies only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a right to go on a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be excluded from a reserve because of all sorts of conduct in breach of the law in Queensland but the position today is that they must have a permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 38 of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971 of Queensland, which has been looked at very closely by Aboriginal councils in Queensland, states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is any quarrel about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> controlling their own areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are trying to say is that there ought to be freedom for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to do their own thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have highlighted the sort of discrimination being practised against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the Queensland Government and by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government has listened to all representations made to it and has given the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> nearly everything they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are aware I have spent 2 weeks in Queensland and I have seen a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time that Bjelke-Petersen wants something said on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he uses the signature of Les Stewart for the purpose of expressing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘ viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Opposition senators to say that the Aboriginal people do not want anything is to attempt to find some excuse for their own attitude of not giving to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves in Queensland the same freedom as they want for white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that demonstration 6 people were arrested, three of them <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the other three university students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner knows perfectly well that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want this Bill to become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland law in force on 1 November 1974 contained provisions which authorised, firstly, the continued management under the present legislation of property managed without the consent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders under earlier Queensland legislation and, secondly, prevented an Aboriginal or Islander from terminating the management of his property if a magistrate were satisfied that termination of management would be detrimental to the best interests of the Aboriginal or Islander or any member of his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those laws, which are concerned with section 4 (6) of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971- a similar provision is contained in the Torres Strait Islanders Act- read as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in respect of the management of property that are discriminatory against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders are contrary to the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of clause 7 of the Bill is to supersede Regulation 14 under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act in its application to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which provides that a person authorised to be on a reserve shall conduct himself properly and to the satisfaction of the Aboriginal Council and management or district officer of the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the humanitarian approach of the Opposition and of the great Neville Bonner, the champion of the Aboriginal people of Queensland, who wants to bring the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> down to the level of South African negroes and not up to the level of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the man who is supposed to be standing up for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite have the audacity to say: ‘We want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have self-determination.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Minister some 6 months ago when he visited Queensland and when my wife and I were given a lift to Brisbane in his car, whether he would have a look at Wilcannia and at the conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator would not know anything about the feelings of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner also referred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being entitled to a better deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go back and tell the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, including  Senator Bonner,  is not prepared to support for Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> conditions which are as high as those relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in every other State of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to extend to the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> provisions similar to those applying in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing there that is detrimental to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amendments to State legislation discriminatory to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-71-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially among estate agents and property owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have applied for special assistance as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but they have had to be rejected, of necessity, because they could claim no Aboriginality although they were dark people of Pacific islands descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the article claimed that we were encouraging such people to claim to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the purpose of getting some benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the subject of impact statements the statement made on behalf of the then Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts read:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very happy to see that an opportunity will be given to groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under this Bill to purchase land and be able to do something with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am very concerned that when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> endeavour through this Bill to purchase land caution shall be taken to ensure that it will be used for the betterment of the Aboriginal people and that it will be ascertained whether the land purchased under the provisions of this Bill will be of some use to the Aboriginal people in an economic sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I prefer the term ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That clause strikes me as rather strange because here we have the Government setting up a commission to deal with an Aboriginal land fund and yet the Government makes provision for only 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should there not be 5 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should this Commission be administered by nonAboriginal people rather than by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can handle such a Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that particular expertise is needed in the field of Aboriginal affairs and I believe that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would certainly be better than non-Aboriginal people as members of this Commission, providing of course that, if necessary, the Aboriginal commissioners could buy or hire white expertise in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why must this power be vested in the Minister rather than in the Commission, which I hope would be made up of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel quite confident in my own mind that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would see these things again as a direction from the white experts, the white administrators, or the pseudo experts as many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> term white people who are involving them-  selves in Aboriginal affairs today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems rather strange to me that we spent some time here last week talking about Queensland, the Queensland Government and the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs having too much say in Aboriginal matters, yet we find the Minister who levelled that criticism at Queensland is in the Federal sphere, putting himself in the position where he shall direct the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the Commission will be comprised of non-Aboriginal people but the Government has conceded that perhaps it will have at least 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill says that at least two may be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not say that two shall, two must or two will; it says that at least two may be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To Aboriginal people land is not just a piece of dirt that can be used for commercial purposes; it is something that is part and parcel of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though I am happy in some regards with what the Government is doing in making finance available so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can purchase back some of their own land, by the same token I am not completely happy with some of the clauses in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is in a frightful position as a result of the defeat last week of the legislation relating to Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has to face the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland in the coming weeks, so he raises a number of questions which show a complete ignorance of normal Bills that deal with commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  motion would achieve nothing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill seems to give something tangible to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is mandatory to appoint 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but the Bill does not limit the number to two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the recommendation of the Australian Government that on the Loans Commission consisting of 5 members, there should be 3 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that Cabinet recommended the appointment of 3 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of 5 members of the Loans Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there are 5 qualified <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have accounting experience in regard to loan moneys, then 5 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> shall be on the Commission, because the Minister makes the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs inform the Parliament of the details of alleged police brutality against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton on 5 January of this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that there is some need for an inquiry into the relationship between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and police in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the allegations concerning events at Laverton and the other allegations which I have conveyed by correspondence to the Acting Premier justify a public royal commission into the relationship between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was alleged by the Aboriginal community when I was at Leonora that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed on special works projects were engaged in building a shed on the property of one of the councillors and in plucking Christmas ducks for another councillor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are on the Commission and how were they appointed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Loans Commission-  Mr Bruce  McGuinness, who was a nominee of the National Aboriginal Congress, and a female Aboriginal from one of the northern towns of Queensland where she is a member of the local shire council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Earlier today I raised, by way of a question, the matter of an assault which allegedly took place by police on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have obtained my information from 2 very reliable white community leaders, who are prepared to have their names attached to any document, together with 2 other white people and a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My informants tell me that this is the third instance in the last 4 years where white policemen have aggravated a situation which was not necessarily of the making of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and which was certainly of only minor importance until such time as the white policemen interfered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that this incident may have been triggered off by some local railway workers who apparently referred to the local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as Black BV. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally this led to retaliation as far as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to remember that all this was happening on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> own community ground where they ought to have had some protection and where they ought to have been able to defend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been further advised that 6 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been charged with assault and that the case is to be heard on 7 March 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer for a couple of minutes more to an incident that occurred when a white man, accompanied by three or four <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, tried to get served at the Kulgera Hotel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> then had to go to the back to buy some soft drinks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Sunday 3 November they were driving back through Kulgera and a similar number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were with  Mr Leahy  on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not often that I find myself on the same platform as my friend Jim Keeffe, but tonight I find that I must agree with him in his call for a royal commission into some of the allegations that have been made from time to time of police brutality and the discrimination that has been shown towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are always the ones who sometimes allow their power to go to their heads and when they are dealing with some unfortunate Aboriginal or group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they do tend to use brutality that they would not use in other circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be the last to deny that there are some naughty <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but there are nonAborigines who can be just as naughty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a royal commission of some kind would bring to light not only the atrocities which are being perpetrated against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and of which  Senator Keeffe  has spoken but also the fact that there are occasions when members of law enforcement agencies need to chastise and bring to justice <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are not doing the right thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this kind of thing happens to other members of the community as well as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard of police brutality and victimisation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is generally accepted today that it is not only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also members of the low socioeconomic community who are being arrested for crimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that from time to time in the areas where the members of the Aboriginal community are regarded as far inferior by the white section of the community, the police somewhat reflect the general attitude of the community that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not receive the normal just treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When his report was given to me I found that it showed he had interviewed only Aboriginal people who had made allegations against the police; but the police refused to see him to contradict the statements and he could just repeat what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had said about how they were brutally assaulted by the police on various occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her  version of the incident, having interviewed the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the court at Alice Springs, was that a member of the train crew abused the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and one Aboriginal of the tribe took exception to it and a fight ensued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought that he would have a good rapport with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for investigation into this matter and report to me and to the Legal Aid Service at Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the police arrived I believe a fight occurred between them and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only then that I found that the sergeant who was sent to Yuendumu had been taken off another settlement because of bad treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The natural hatred of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the policeman caused an upsurge of violence on his arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot is achieved if policemen can talk to and cooperate with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WhenI was there Europeans claimed that they walked into a police station and saw a sergeant of police bashing up an Aboriginal in order to obtain from him an assurance that he would plead guilty to a charge the next morning.I have heard of policemen saying to their girl friendsthis is not the evidence of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- ‘I am going out to get a few more boongs’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Premier appointed the magistrate to make a report on the matter because of his sympathy to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and his record in Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Doubts have been expressed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that the fear of going before a royal commission may prevent the obtaining of the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to meet the special needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Darwin, it is intended that this provision will not affect areas such as Bagot and Kulaluk, except by specific Government direction after consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, nor prejudice any claims they may have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that the Commission and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would co-operate in the planning of the development of such lands and in the proper housing and location of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government policy is wrapped up in a promise to give land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Bagot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cabinet has decided that tribal land should be returned to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Nabarlek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On another occasion there was a radio broadcast concerning some of the appalling conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been forced to live for almost 150 years in the electorate of Kennedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a Bill that would be giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the opportunity which they would not otherwise have to borrow money to purchase homes, furniture and many other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, the last part of that question referring to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as partAborigines is an insult to the entire race of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not putting a means test on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine whether they are entitled to borrow from this Loans Commission, as I have said once before I must be a Dutchman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the point- what is the hypocrisy- in setting up an Aboriginal Loans Commission from which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can borrow money which, in the words of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, they otherwise would not have the opportunity to do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, I am concerned because many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- I would say as many as 95 per cent of those who are genuinely in need- will be turned away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These laughing hyenas opposite are supposed to be the champions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when I am talking about a serious matter that could affect the lives of thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> all they can do is laugh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I think in some respects he has a grievance which could have been overcome by an approach to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think on the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>  Senator Bonner  and I should have something in common- the betterment of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague,  Senator Bonner,  has said to me there are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia who would very much like to be able to nave the opportunity to obtain a loan upon reasonable terms to improve their houses, their furnishings and their opportunity for some of the material benefits of life, but who do not want to have a hand-out and be simply getting something for nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course  Senator Bonner  has a deep interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and an appreciation that the loan fund is being established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill was introduced to set up the Aboriginal Loans Commission which would administer a loan fund for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plea of  Senator Bonner,  as repeated by  Senator Rae,  is in respect of the need for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have a credit rating, assets and equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Bonner  has been talking to a group of people in my Department who are concerned that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot get this loan if they are in constant government employment because they have an income far in excess of $8,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who protested earns a salary between $14,300 and $14,800 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the shortage of loan money available to the organisation, should a loan be made to  Senator Bonner  when impoverished <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot receive a loan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first part of the motion, which seeks that the Senate accept the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this enure nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, is a historical fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conclusion of both learned judges was that there was no legal claim by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as such to any land in Australia other than land that individuals may have acquired by purchase or lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Woodward Commission submitted 2 reports- an interim report and a final reportand recommended in respect of the Northern Territory that we should set up 2 land councils comprising <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that the 2 land councils should receive representations on land claims and that they should report to the Government within 2 years, the Government to act upon their report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with  Mr Justice  Woodward’s decision those who have tribal claims to land or those groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which claim long residential rights to land are now the subject of investigation by the Central Lands Committee and the Northern Lands Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, to all intents and purposes, the Gurindji land rights claims have been met and the leasehold property will be given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of arranging for the land councils to lease the land on a 99-year basis to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are actually on the settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be the occupiers and owners of that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases we are funding the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to make the properties viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only exception is Queensland which will not have a bar of giving anything to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are discussing now on an interdepartmental committee how we can give land to Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the same way as we have succeeded in giving, or are in the process of succeeding in giving, land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the rest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leaves only the other question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have become assimilated into white society, do not live on settlements and do not want pastoral properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deal with the question of urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the Australian Labor Party policy platform includes an undertaking that compensation for loss of traditional land will be made available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to purchase their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, we have passed the Aboriginal Loans Commission Act, which we discussed last evening, to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by providing low interest rates for the purchase of homes, among other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circular that was complained of is being issued by my Department on behalf of the Loans Commission to acquaint <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with their entitlements under the Aboriginal Land Fund Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Bonner  saw in it some attempt to divide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by referring to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner saw this statement as dividing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am agreeing but honourable senators should not accept that the question was asked for the purpose of dividing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as I think  Senator Bonner  and I accepted last evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can we do something better with regard to compensation for loss of land to urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to reports that he visited Perth yesterday to discuss with the Western Australian Government relations between the police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to a Press statement attributed to  Mr David  Parsons, an Aboriginal Legal Aid Service lawyer, in which he claims that there is massive exploitation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aboriginal settlements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any truth in his claim that taxi drivers charge <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> $20 for a flagon of wine and that some settlements near Alice Springs put up to a 1 50 per cent mark-up on food and other articles sold to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, when someone knows that he has been defrauded it does not make for good relationships between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Loans Commission was set up it sought to impose some restrictions so that money would be available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who otherwise could not get loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is still some problem in keeping track of the movements of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report indicates that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are satisfied with the services being provided at the Pennington hostel by the Department of Labor and Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the survey team visits various areas we will continue to get reports and take any remedial action that is necessary for the purpose of rectifying any complaints or grievances that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I refer to the recent statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Alice Springs who have alcohol difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department has made available an amount of $30,000 for the supervision of the home, for a conveyance to pick up <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the streets and for 2 officers to look after them and supervise their conduct from the time they come under the officers ‘ control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that a sum of $4,000 was promised by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to assist in the cost of transporting and accommodating delegates who attended the meeting of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders which was held in Canberra during Easter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From memory, a request for $8,000 was made to me for the conference in Canberra of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and, as a result, a fortnight ago I approved of the payment of $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he aware of the fact that the Queensland Country Party Government gazetted an Order in Council on 15 March 1975 that had the effect of placing under the control of the Public Curator of that State all personal property of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ Historic Places Trust and the Cape York Conservation Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister advise what action can be taken by the Australian Government to counter the continuing high-handed acts of the Queensland Country Party Government against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and conservationists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He left with me an order from the  Clerk  of the Executive Council in Queensland which stated that all the personal property of the said Cape York Conservation Council and the said <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Historic Places Trust be vested in the Public Curator of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within that community there is sometimes what one might term ‘clan warfare’, in a very minor way, between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are living in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am writing for advice to help my grandson, William Leslie Davidson aged 2 1 years (Aborigine) who was tried in the District Court in Ipswich before a judge and jury on the 10 September 1974 charged with grievous bodily harm against one Robert Anderson, Cecil McDonald, Collin McDonald, all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no justice for <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> …. as long as they arrest someone and get a conviction, they are happy <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The type of thing to which  Mr Davidson  refers- trial by newspapers- happens so often with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I am bringing before this chamber something pertaining to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> all he can do is natter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to an article in the ‘Queensland Times’ (21-8-74) headed ‘Ipswich <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a forgotten race’, outlining an interview with  Mr Fisher  of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee I would like to add a few words in protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>while I am not suggesting that the Queensland Government is without faults, I think that he and his fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be very grateful that housing is given to them for small rentals (a privilege not given to other members of the community). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the story ‘Ipswich <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a forgotten race ‘ (‘ Q.T. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are sheafs and sheafs recording nasty things said by white people about a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who unfortunately do not conform or behave the way the rest of the community would like them to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major nightmare in my mind is that prior to the trial much had appeared in the local newspaper ‘The Queensland Times in the column- Letters to the Editor- re the bad behaviour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the vicinity of the ‘crime ‘ i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And things in the press concerning ‘Blacks’ tending to interest European readers (if that news’ is against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>) would then of course sway the thinking of an all-white jury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While on this point, and to digress for a moment; why are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not called more frequently for Jury duty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in the Police investigation of the case,  Mrs Bonner  a J.P. and fully conversant with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Ipswich area rang the Detective on the case and informed him that in her opinion (an opinion which the Ipswich Police have never hesitated to seek during the past many, many years) William Leslie Davidson known as ‘Junior’, was not the ‘Junior’ whom the Police should be questioning but Donald Davidson Junior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have tried all types of avenues seeking justice; perhaps we’ve been wrong at times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he also aware that the Premier of Queensland, the Honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen, has refused to accept the policy of the National Country Party in that he will not agree to hand over control of 16 Aboriginal land reserves in Queensland to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> residing upon them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is significant that the perverse character who refused leave to  Senator Coleman  to table documents on racism comes from the State that carried out a policy of genocide of its <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to recite the poem to the Senate because I think it puts something of our responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and something of the compensation that ought to be paid to these people to whom hitherto we have paid very little attention and whom this Bill is dedicated to help as much as it is dedicated to help all the other disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have said that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot take drink because of some physical disability, that their manner of drinking is at fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should notturn upon the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as we do and fail to realise that the same situation applies equally to the white population as it does to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is abundant evidence in this country at this point of time of puny public officials in central Australia and the Northern Territory who take it upon themselves to say to an Aboriginal woman or man that they are not to get social services or child endowment because in the puny mind of those officials the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might spend the money in a way that does not suit the custom of the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will enable those of us who have a social conscience to say that such officials do not have the right to discriminate against  Mr A  or  Mrs B  because they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or because they are members of some migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hypocritical and racist for us to hold the opinion that little assistance ought to be given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because they take every opportunity to drink themselves into stupidity with any money they receive while we support and make contributions to organisations whose prime function is to deal with alcoholics, when we see in this Parliament members who are unable to handle alcohol properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She said that the fact that proportionately more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than whites are sentenced to imprisonment or denied bail in Australia has been amply demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past 180 years <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have suffered enormous handicaps in Australian society by comparison with whites, commencing with violent dispossession of their land and destruction of their social fabric, and continuing through various forms of legal, social and economic discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be the height of hypocrisy for white Australians now to say to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that from here on the race must be on equal terms, without taking into account the 180 years start which white Australians have given themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unless the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> leave to go back to their places of abode they are the ones who are arrested and charged with drunkenness whereas the whites, who are in a similar state of inebriation, are allowed to proceed by their cars and by other forms of transport to their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One does not have to talk to many migrants or many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to appreciate how much they react to the attitude that exists amongst so many of the Australian people, to realise the alienation and confusion felt by the children of migrants in our schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an area of some 10 acres which at one time was used for the purpose of housing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were later moved into the town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> protested and said that the area belonged to them and that they wanted the land back for their own development, I took the matter up in conference with the then Victorian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Dickie,  who agreed with me and said that if the Aboriginal community produced a plan for development he would give serious consideration to handing the land over to the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hired consultants and town planners to develop a plan to use the area for the housing of only 3 families, an artifacts factory for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and a central office for the Aboriginal cultural organisation which was operating in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Priority will also be given to families in economic or other distress, and to groups with particular needs such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants, handicapped children and isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the legislation on our notice paper- the Bill that has been through the Senate and the House of Representatives and now has been returned to the Senate with some proposed amendments- will overcome the discrimination that now applies to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on settlements in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These youthful or even middle age memories remain and condition one’s attitudes, I suppose; so much so that in the early 1950s, when it was unfashionable to embrace the problem of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I was able to persuade the Chief Secretary of Victoria, the late  Sir Arthur  Rylah, to set up a royal commission to examine the problem of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the context of the society in which they found themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the report of the royal commission and its acceptance by the Victorian Government, the impact and drive by the Victorian Government to try to change the situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria in the context of the society in which they found themselves were destroyed by all the egg-heads at the University of Melbourne who proceeded to get into the act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem that besets  Senator Cavanagh,  the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, at present in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is bedevilled to a major degree by the intellectual egg-heads at the universities and by the anthropologists because they cannot see the wood for the trees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 6 children would have been institutionalised as part of a program of moving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of East Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He told me that he had brought many such applications, but never had any of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned been represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> established that they were well dressed and that they went to the hotel for the same purpose as white people- to have a drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have tried to purchase hostels for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Canberra we were refused the purchase of a building because we intended to house <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After it was found that the nursing home was to be purchased for use by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there was the lie that old people would be thrown out of the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think 18 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were arrested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which was supported by the policeman, was that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were put in 2 paddy wagons- nine in each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The publican was proud that his Alsatian dog had been trained to smell out <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, just as Customs officers train their dogs to smell out opium and other drugs coming into the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir Magnus Cormack said that I am doing my best to bring <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> up to a standard where they will be accepted in white society, but there is so much difficulty in the way that we have reached a stage where it is for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to decide whether they want to degenerate to the standard of the white society or whether they will lead their own cultural life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now have Australian Government financial support for any project which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> establish and which is approved by the Australian Government, other than the erection of structures on settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disproportionate cost would indicate that there are more European families than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who cannot meet the tenancy requirements of the Western Australian Housing Commission, but as there are still more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outside the requirements of the Housing Commission my Department would willingly provide greater housekeeping services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With reference to environmental and ecological factors in Aboriginal advancement programs and enterprises, the Committee believes that the question of whether adequate consideration is being given to these can be considered to come within the scope of its current examination of the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the examination of the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders now in its final stages, the Committee has decided that its next area of concern should be the environmental impact of the current woodchip industry program, which was referred to us on 28 November last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pertinent to the difficulties of representing Kalgoorlie is the fact that it has the lowest proportion of enrolled electors to total population in Australia for 2 reasons, namely many of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not enrolled and many of the people who work in the Kalgoorlie electorate are transitory workers who are enrolled elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Committee has before it at the moment a reference relating to the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other instances I recall opposition to town planning and housing programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly it exists in all kinds of direction with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Australians, with the Jewish people and other Australians, with the people who come here as migrants and it follows, as  Senator Wood  said, that if one speaks English, there is no difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who was not in the chamber earlier, I have said also that on occasions 1 have congratulated his Government for some of its enlightened attitudes to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and I was congratulating his Government for introducing this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether there is an area in the Bill through which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What avenues are open to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enable them to find the style of housing they desire? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he is aware, the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs apparently is committed to the misuse of Australian Government moneys in the purchase of homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Mount Isa I think thirty houses were allocated for purchase by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just happen to have a bloke out there in the public bar who just does not happen to like <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a publican does not have such a policy and if he does not mind having <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> drinking in his hotel he could come along to the court and say, in accordance with this provision: ‘This was none of my doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publican who had not instructed his barman to refuse to serve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and who had reprimanded his barman and told him to reverse that practice would surely be in the clear before the law, but if this practice went on and on he would not be able to discharge the mild onus that I suggest is provided in this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs advise the approximate growth rate of the number of young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> staying on at secondary school through the provision of Aboriginal secondary grants by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have stayed on at school has increased over recent years at the rate of, I think, about 10 per cent each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not be ejected from a reserve unless it can be shown that their conduct is unreasonable and would justify their ejection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be free to move away from the reservefrom their home, to put it that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 3 major parties in the federal sphere, as I understand it, have as part of their policy self-determination for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Aboriginal communities selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to support the amendment because for the first time in the history of Australia <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are really getting self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the laws in Queensland discriminate at all, they discriminate in favour of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Islanders in a way that can be tolerated by other Queenslanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Act represents the desires of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which is not what the Federal Minister wants, that is, to tell the people what they are to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In previous debates I have dispelled the myth that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have had their properties managed by the State Government by force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have dispelled also the myth that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders are tried for minor offences by a Queensland Government kangaroo court by showing that an Aboriginal or an Islander is tried for these offences by a court of his tribal elders, which fills all the criteria for a good judicial system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We admit that problems concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> exist outside the communities, but mainly with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who in their own way are trying to be assimilated or perhaps not trying to be assimilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will take a discriminatory look at the representation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in their communities in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Queensland State elections which were held on 7 December last year- I remind honourable senators that that was the anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbour- and which were fought on Federal issues, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders showed the Canberra mandarins of mandates just what sort of malarkey they were talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this Bill was introduced originally simply as an attempt to discredit the Queensland Premier- because the Federal Labor Government sees him as its most formidable opponent- at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland, because this Government flew in the face of the expressed wishes of the people of those communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for saying that the 2 Acts concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are still required, this is just so much poppycock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the 2 Acts that concern <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the other is the Queensland Country Party Government, or whatever it is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to emphasise this point because  Senator Sheil  states that it was because of the good policies of his Party and because of the magnitude of outlook of his Party towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that his party holds the number of seats that it does in Queensland today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he said that the Queensland Acts are discriminating in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed appreciation that at last we have given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the freedom of selfdetermination, and if an injustice is done to an Aborigine he has the right to receive legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the freedom of selfdetermination that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present 40 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are enrolled there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been many instances of such appointments in recent times and in addition to the large number of Royal Commissions several recent inquiries have been conducted by retired judges, namely the Barrier Reef inquiry by  Mr Justice  Wallace, the Western Australian inquiries into <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by  His  Honour Judge Furnell and the inquiry into airlines by  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Sholl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take up a few minutes of the time of the Senate to say how disappointed I am- as I am quite sure are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the length and breadth of Australia- at what appears to be our loss of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Senator Cavanagh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia will be conscious of the loss of a very fine Minister from this portfolio, a Minister who has done a remarkable job for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will regret the move that has been made, but one or two will not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that honourable senators do not know of the cooperation there has been between  Senator Bonner  and me on the many occasions on which he has come to me representing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In turn, these young people speak on behalf of all we islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are from the Tweed, especially those of us who were born on the Tweed and more especially those of us whose roots are firmly embedded in Ukerebagh Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukerebagh Island was declared a reserve and given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1927 but <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lived there long before that- many, many years before that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24 December 1861 it was declared a water reserve, but on to that water reserve were herded the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders those many years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>59497: ‘Reserved from sale for use of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’; on 26 October 1951 it was again gazetted, No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> left Ukerebagh Island and moved to the mainland, but they did not do that because they no longer desired to live there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So without consultation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and without ascertaining the reason why the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> left the island, the reserve was gazetted and reserved from sale for future public requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again will be taken away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for use as fish markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government- I have said this on many occasions and I make no retraction from what I have said- has implemented some very good policies in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was used as an area into which to herd <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders many years ago and there they did die of malnutrition and diseases they caught from the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tribal tie on the part of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and there is a residential tie so far as the South Sea Islanders are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that there is only one fault with  Senator Bonner  and that is that every question he raises about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has to be emotional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question of justice for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second course of action is for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to suggest that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders concerned at the future of the island apply to the Aboriginal Lands Trust to purchase the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third course is that no action be taken, since the plans being developed for the island seem to satisfy the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Islanders of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have 3 courses open to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in other matters- pensioners servicemen, ex-servicemen and their dependants <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> migrants assisted overseas students persons approved by the AttorneyGeneral or his delegate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there will be no means test for social service pensioners, <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> or assisted students; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially the land will be held by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under a pastoral lease issued under the Crown Lands Ordinance of the Northern Territory; following passage of the proposed Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Act, however, it is intended that the pastoral lease will be surrendered and the Gurindji will be given freehold title to the land in accordance with the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-64-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, to avoid bloodshed, instigate a full inquiry into the Trotskyists and other elements who have taken over the Aboriginal militant movement and the distribution by them of firearms and hard drugs to young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-64-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not desirable that business on the lives of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be actively sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could have been done while maintaining grants to the States and to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for legal aid and while maintaining the existing numerical and equipment strength of the police forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator would know, the Kormilda College and the Alice Springs College in the Northern Territory have introduced bilingual classes for the purpose of teaching tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own dialect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated by some of my colleagues that the moneys spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs during the coming year will be of the dimension of $9,000 for each Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Prime Minister who sanctions the irresponsible expenditure of the taxpayers’ money on unwanted paintings that have offended most of his mandate, a Prime Minister who sanctions irresponsible expenditure on Aboriginal affairs to the detriment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the disadvantage of others, a Prime Minister who sanctions irresponsible expenditure on sordid films and proposes unhealthy law reform on incest, abortion and homosexuality, a Prime Minister whose every attempt to subvert our Constitution - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also seen a copy of the report by 18 lawyers from New South Wales on allegations about police relations with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept, from my experience, that policemen simply go out to end boredom at weekends by bashing up <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the results of that inquiry will be fruitful and that better relations will be established between the police and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Commonwealth has a right to look after the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, some restrictions are placed on it so far as making inquiries into the actions of State police is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health: Can he advise the Senate of any initiatives or proposals that are currently being considered for the treatment of the disastrous effects of trachoma amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its incidence is much higher amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than it is amongst white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement the Minister recognises that there is an obligation to assist the people of Cocos (Keeling) Islands in exactly the same terms as we are prepared to assist other people in Australia, that is to say the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who migrated to Australia and occupied land here long before the Cocos (Keeling) Islanders landed in that territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We acknowledge that it is quite proper that we should set up enterprises of one sort or another for the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the most recent being that of the Gurindji people in northern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spent a lot of time with  Senator Keeffe  on a committee looking into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows that even the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia do not receive adequate representation if their circumstances are applied to a one vote, one value situation and compared with people such as myself or  Senator Keeffe  who live in metropolitan Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  would know as well as I do if he had read my minority report as a member of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory- I doubt whether he did- that I put up a special case for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory over a temporary period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  said in effect that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have not put themselves on the electoral roll are not entitled to representation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cites as examples of that certain <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who do not turn up to vote, certain migrants who are not registered yet, prisoners in gaol, children, people who are not on the electoral roll, and I presume people who vote informally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Did the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs see the Australian Broadcasting Commission Four Corners program at the weekend, which reported that a number of Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been detained on a rape and assault charge and had signed statements to this effect when in fact it was proven that the charges were specious and that the method of obtaining the statements was questionable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is this a common police practice in the Northern Territory when dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Reverend Downing pointed out that the confession could not have been of Aboriginal origin insofar as it used words that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would not know and gave information that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not convicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the period November 1974 to February 1975, the New South Wales Health Commission, using Australian Government funds, provided a free supply of fresh fruit and vegetables to Wilcannia <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Board built fourteen small houses on the Aboriginal Reserve (Mission) in 1953, to which were added laundry/bathrooms, electricity and other improvements in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: How many houses have been provided to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a direct result of sit-ins in the offices of the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have benefited as a direct result of these purchases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to go to such an extent as sitting-in to focus attention on their grievances, if their grievances are justified the Department will do everything possible to try to rectify them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that every Aborigine in Australia who has enough money for the cost of a telegram, a letter or a telephone call has been contacting  Senator Bonner  begging him to relieve the distress which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are suffering at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a question I asked the Minister on 14 October concerning relations between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and police in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been asked to make a report to me on their inquiry and recommendations on future police investigations involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not demanding an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also in the implementation of Aboriginal policies we must be careful to distinguish between the more traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whose self identity has been culturally shaped and formed, and those whose self identity has been largely formed on the basis of colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter, for political reasons, have attempted to project the image that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a homogeneous race- a fact which is vigorously disputed by the cultural <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also acknowledged that despite some wrongful policies of the past a lot has been achieved in the development of employment areas for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact we are pledged to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are granted land and that subsequent legislation contributes to the ultimate goal of a successful bi-racial community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me say that many people appear to forget that with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we are dealing with people, not just numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr BjelkePetersen  criticised what he termed as an army of self appointed spokesmen for the Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we have to keep our promises like the Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that he and his fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are asking is that the Government and the mining corporation, consortium or what have you, sit and talk with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am gravely concerned and am insisting that fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Aurukun be totally consulted re proposed bauxite mining project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland Young Liberals, after hearing  Senator Neville  Bonner, have joined the growing list of people and organisations dissatisfied with the State Government s treatment of Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over bauxite mining in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government should pause before implementing its mining legislation and consult the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their representatives about the future of the Aurukun reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have with me, and I think it is worth mentioning at this point of time, a newspaper article indicating that 300 Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have petitioned the Queensland Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to employment, the Second Schedule to the Queensland legislation provides that the mining company will employ ‘employable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ from the Aurukun community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look at it this way: If the employment officer from the mining company visited the community with thoughts of employing some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, he might say: ‘Look, councillors, I want 3 bulldozer drivers, 3 endloader drivers, 2 mechanics, and 1 plumber’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no employable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are going to employ 1500 people, but how many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will you employ? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But not the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not the original owners; they are not entitled to royalties, I am told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the situation in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have sat with my friend Neville Bonner in Aboriginal camps and I have cried with him over the conditions that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live in in his State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish that he would talk more loudly and more often about how <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are treated in his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For 23 years honourable senators opposite ignored the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already, the grant for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been slashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be interested to hear the details of the question which has originated from  Senator Cavanagh,  knowing as we do of his previous experience and interest in matters relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A staff organisation tailored exclusively to the community schools of the Territory might not adequately serve the needs of schools for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such people could do a lot for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have difficulty in relating to people they do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> quite some time to settle into the training situation in the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The training will be done where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live or in an area they know quite well nearby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are none more profound than education, particularly in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff,  who in common with  Senator Robertson  was with me from time to time in the Northern Territory last week, mentioned the fall off in the attendance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at schools in settlements in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that no one will think that I am a new-found expert on educating <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the members of the parliamentary committee that was concerned with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, having been to those places, would agree with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to recognise that not all the education that we give to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is good education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone amongst us say with brashness or with clarity of vision that he knows what we ought to be doing to educate the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do say is this: As a number of honourable senators have acknowledged, essentially it is clear that firstly we must train more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received letters from the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate nominating Senators Baume, Bonner, Davidson, Keeffe, Melzer and Mulvihill to serve as members on the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the senators nominated in accordance with the resolution of the Senate establishing the Committee be appointed members of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were charged with murder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the report places some doubt upon the innocence of the 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, they cannot be charged again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had pleaded guilty to a charge of rape and that they were duly convicted according to law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had appeared on charges of murder and were defended by the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service which had engaged  Mr Baker,  Q.C., to defend them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prosecution relied at that time upon the fact that it was alleged the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had made confessions to inflicting brute force on the individual on the night of the rape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this gentleman has spent a lifetime among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knew very well the Pitjantjara language which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> spoke and gave strong evidence that on no account could these confessions be the confessions of the 2 accused who were illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with a very slight knowledge of the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The phraseology of the confessions was not the type that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the magistrate said that he did not put convincing weight on Reverend Downing ‘s evidence because he thought that he was too much involved with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It asked how the police could obtain confessions from Aboriginal people under our system of justice when in fact those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could not make the confessions despite the fact that they had signed them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They interviewed the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the weight of one of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was shown as 16 stone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is supplying the best legal aid for an accused before a court but it does not have an organisation or a branch that is considering the penalties inflicted upon <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I had a great affection for the tribal Aboriginesthe Pitjantjara are tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- and their honesty and sincerity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When such <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> offend against tribal law they admit it on all occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the question of what we are doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in relation to Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there is the presentation by the police officers of something that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in fact did not say as a true and voluntary confession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what 1 see as ‘good Black Power’, for, until my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> gain the confidence and pride which is rightfully theirs, they will be at a permanent disadvantage in the world they now find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its adherents claim that the present system will not cater for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that it never will represent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will continue to lack political power until the present system ‘ is removed, if necessary by violent means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that he would have the intestinal fortitude to say them outside the parliament or in some place where I could act in the way that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> acted and meted out justice prior to 1 788. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gentleman says that there has been no dispossession of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have never been dispossessed and that they have all the opportunities of every other Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite claim to know so much about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The place of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australian society has changed considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them are piping up here tonight-  have been disturbed by the past history of oppression of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and by their consequent present condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3, 1969) on the impact of Comalco’s mining at Weipa on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area, showed that the process begun in 1788. and described by C. D. Rowley in his ‘The Destruction of Aboriginal Society’, is not remote history, but a present reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That refers to the struggle of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resistance of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to white invasion in northern Queensland was among the most spirited in Australian history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was not referring to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; he was referring to the settlers of this particular part of northern Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defeated and demoralised, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were more easily brought in and kept on the Mission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others held out, and in the 1950s, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were still coming in from the country to live at Aurukun Mission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to buy land off reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing that in mind, and being aware of the fact that the Queensland Government has sent its Ombudsman to Aurukun to investigate the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there, this afternoon I sent this letter to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser): <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were statements that the Queensland Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement Department knew nothing about it, and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on the Aurukun Reserve certainly knew nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have mentioned Weipa at this point, I think that Australia ought to take a warning from the fact that, in spite of all sorts of watertight agreements in relation to the development of the Weipa bauxite field, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lost out all the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many hundreds of thousands of Australian Government dollars already have been spent on developing this area, but of course neither the mission nor the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were told that at a later date the school and other developments on the reserve may be needed for a mining town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The story is being told that barrages will be erected on the local river so that if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not prepared to move out of the lower portion of their village they will be flooded out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To employ employable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in positions and occupations which they are capable of filling and to seek the advice and assistance of the Mission and the Council in the selection of such employees and the allocation of such duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To conduct their operations upon the Reserves so as to cause as little inconvenience as practicable to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to damage any Leichhardt pines or other good stands of timber used by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a source of lumber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of the relinquishing of the land, the provisions do not conform with the demands of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that is, that those areas should not be developed where certain relinquishments have to be made annually, but more so with the Queensland Department of Mines regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that time, no doubt, their hope is that they will either have driven every Aboriginal off the Reserve or the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have died of broken hearts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development clearly not in the interest of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> against Australian equity in mining ventures and clear indication of opportunism by consortium and State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can now advise that the Premier has indicated to the solicitors of the consortium who have assumed negotiations with regard to the development of the bauxite deposits embracing the Aurukun Reserve, that the Government requires the negotiation of a firm agreement by representatives of the companies with representatives of the Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Presbyterian Church of Queensland regarding the payment by the companies, in addition to royalties, of an amount to be credited to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would be up in arms in an effort to protect them but because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are an indigenous minority group- they have suffered 200 years of government dominated by people of European descent- this is their final call. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment and training schemes will be urgently investigated with aim of increasing job opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a Liberal-Country Party Government <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be better not worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister contact the Tasmanian Government to ensure that Aboriginal organisations and interested <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be notified so that they may be present if they so desire when this takes place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel quite sure that it would be agreed by us all that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are an intense part of the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the right of most housing commissions to choose suitable tenants, which includes <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the treatment by the Premier of Queensland, his neglect and his attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, it was decided by the Australian Government that we had to take responsibility away from Queensland and see that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State were recognised as Australians and not outcasts of society as they were previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  today and  Senator Bonner  the other night have told us of the conditions for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was part of the policy of the Labor Government to give responsibility and respectability to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that year the allocation for housing in Queensland increased and more houses were either built or purchased for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland than ever before in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I make the point again that this is all for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He raised the question not only of what we should communicate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also of how we should relate to them and how they should relate to us in their endeavour to get jobs in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition my Department has taken significant steps towards providing educational facilities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have moved to their tribal lands from established settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to hear  Senator Keeffe  express such a wish, although I would prefer the word ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ to ‘Aboriginals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present scheme involves the Aboriginal people in the matter of self-determination, about which we have rightly spoken so often, and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having the opportunity to manage their own affairs and do things for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Which programs are the Technical and Further Education Commission conducting or supporting with respect to disadvantaged persons wishing to participate in technical and further education with particular reference to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the physically handicapped and those with problems relating to literacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Five projects are being supported through the Technical and Further Education Commission research grants in the areas in question- one on the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for technical and further education; three related to literacy problems of adults; and one in connection with the employment of disabled people who have qualified through technical and further education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is a matter of urgency and as most of the questions concern cutbacks in Aboriginal education, I ask the Minister to inform the Parliament whether it is his policy to withdraw most of the education funds from the Northern Territory only in those areas where the majority of pupils are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that this Government would give a low priority to the education or the general welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is to fail to understand both our policies and our actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, I acknowledge his genuine interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I and my Government are endeavouring to do the best we can to maintain the real standards of education for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and others in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to be able to announce in future weeks some substantial innovations or reforms aimed to give to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a greater facility and quality of delivery of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying this to the honourable senator, as I have said before: I know of no more profoundly difficult problem for any individual or for any government to understand than the problem of educating the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not neglect the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Premier of Western Australia has stated publicly that he will this day table in the Western Australian Parliament a copy of the report of the royal commission jointly established by the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments on the incidents between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton, Western Australia, on 5 January 1975, will the Minister likewise table a copy of such report in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek to make a plea for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were all things to improve the lot of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During my period as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I got on very well with members of the then Opposition who were interested in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that period there were no disputes between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and other members of this Parliament, particularly honourable senators in this chamber, who were voicing proposals to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has set up a committee of inquiry into the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee to see whether its expenditure can be reduced, to see whether an alternative method of running the committee may be found, and to see whether its expenditure can be cut for the purpose of financing other proposals- perhaps to the detriment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I raised this matter previously I pointed out that there appeared to be a mistake by the police in their presentation of the statement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were charged with murder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charges were laid against six <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Papunya, four of whom pleaded guilty to charges of assault with intent to rape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the recommendations made by the officers in the main, relate to police investigations procedures and, accordingly, I have written to the Minister for the Northern Territory, who is responsible for the Northern Territory Police Force, commending the report to his attention with a view to implementing the recommended changes in police investigation procedures, particularly in those cases where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every Aborigine in the Northern Territory wants an inquiry to be held to ensure that what happened to Paula Sweet does not happen to other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I received a report relating to the bashing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Skull Creek on 5 January last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a series of negotiations and discussions a joint royal commission was established by the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government, the expense of which was shared by both governments, to inquire into what happened between the police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Skull Creek last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, as a result of the 1967 referendum on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Commonwealth now has a responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were trying, in co-operation with the States, to advance and improve the standing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are still subject to State laws, nevertheless, we cannot wipe our hands of the Aboriginal question when we see injustices done to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has built houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an assembly place for all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the desert area and from the gold mining area in Western Australia who come into the township for various reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was much drinking and much fighting between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, at times, between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 5 January 1975 a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was coming from Warburton for the purpose of attending a religious ceremony at Wiluna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ceremony attracted <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from many hundreds of miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lorry, a Land Rover and a station wagon were used to convey <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Warburton to Wiluna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I felt somewhat guilty because only a few weeks previously I was at Warburton where there are some of the most primitive <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contractor would not permit the truck to be used for transporting these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to Wiluna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it was a religious trip, as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had a registered driver, as they had agreed to take all care with the truck and as it meant such a lot in the lives of these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to go to such a religious ceremony, I made representations to the contractor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endeavoured to convince him that, as the Department was paying for the cost of the trip, he should permit the truck, which after all was the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ truck, to be used for conveying these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to this ceremony and organise the work for the 3 days for which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be away so that he would not have any use for the truck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He agreed, and this was the truck that was used for transporting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got to Skull Creek where they rested on the side of the road. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got to Skull Creek the police had gone out and met them up the road for the purpose of seeing what time they would arrive at Skull Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> arrived at Skull Creek 22 policemen raided them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They let 2 elderly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> go and charged all the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a conference they decided that each one of them had to be responsible for laying a complaint against a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had to make up a story about the way in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were in breach of the Western Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The police agreed to say that when they arrived the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were fighting amongst themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the outburst came and it was claimed that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were innocent, that they were doing no harm, that they were arrested for no reason at all, it was said that the Commissioner of Police wanted a charge laid against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that he could counter this propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not a question of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fighting amongst themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policemen said that when they arrived the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> began to fight the policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were charged with offences that they never committed on the Statements of police officers who never arrested them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Legal Aid Service of Western Australia went to the Press and claimed that injustice had been done to these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a good rapport with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a magistrate in an area of Western Australia where there were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for that reason had the confidence of both the police and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My insistence on a royal commission into this matter met with no approval from the Western Australian Government until I decided that there was some constitutional doubt whether the Commonwealth, while it had power to look after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and investigate what happened to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, could inquire into the activities or action of State police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to operate within the Constitution we decided to set up a royal commission to inquire into <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the desert area, which included Alice Springs and those areas such as Warburton, Kalgoorlie and Skull Creek, particularly into police relations with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the only intention of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was to go and worship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commission found that drink was the cause of a lot of the upheaval between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Huelin,  of the Aboriginal Legal Service, said that the Western Australian Government owed the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> an apology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has a special duty because he is the person appointed to look after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to see that at least they get a fair deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people, particularly in the Dili area, who are regarded by many anthropologists as having very strong similarities to some Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this was the reason for the two-pronged attack used by Labor over the last 3 years- language through the bilingual program plus use of both languages on the settlements, in the churches, in discussions, in decision-making and so on; also the Woodward report, leading to the Lands Commission and land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This sessional committee which I had set up in those days- some 12 years ago now- was designed to ensure that all legislation in the Territory discriminatory towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today many people in Australia are taking an interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and in land rights but 12 years ago the actions we took then on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory were somewhat novel inasmuch as not very much similar legislation was being enacted by the Australian Government and by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third report said that there appeared to be an increase in the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> charged in the courts with offences associated with drinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same report the Committee noted that no legislation had yet been introduced to make provision for the fixing of wage rates for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in order that the matter be put beyond any doubt your Committee recommends that the Wards’ Employment Ordinance be amended to provide specifically that it has no application to persons employed in an industry with respect to which an award of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission applies where the award does not exempt the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the matters already referred to are receiving the attention of various authorities, this Committee has devoted particular attention to a system of land tenure of lands on reserves for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that report they then introduced into the Legislative Council an ordinance to make provision for the granting to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of leases of land which had been reserved for the use and benefit of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for purposes connected therewith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next move was in 1967 when a referendum was held to test the views of the Australian electorate on counting Aboriginals in the census and on removing words from section 51 of the Constitution which were discriminatory against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the  implemention  of Aboriginal policies we must be careful to distinguish between the more traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whose self-identity has been culturally shaped and formed, and those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whose self-identity has been culturally shaped and formed, and those whose selfidentity has been largely formed on the basis of colour . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter for  political  reasons, have tried to project the image that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a homogeneous race- a fact which is vigorously disputed by the ‘cultural’ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example of that, in Alice Springs there has been general agreement between the community, the municipal council and all interested people, including the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, because consultation has taken place about areas of land to be put aside where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can camp and for the development of their housing associations and cooperatives, but nothing has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask the Minister whether it is also a fact that most of those to be dismissed are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was reported that until 2 1 December there was complete harmony between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspector Hilton, on the evidence of Sergeant Holmwood, said to him: ‘You are too soft with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there had been complete co-operation and harmony between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the police, the attitude of the Senior Inspector of the western desert district of Western Australia was that police had to take a definite attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 5 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were picked up from the Land Rover were charged with offences that occurred near the lorry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arresting constable of those 5 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was one of the constables who was not in the car which stopped them and who never saw them until they got in the lorry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at no time were those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within a mile of Cox Street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were stopped in the bush. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had not been there that day or for some days previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That got over the problem of one of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He appeared in court and signed the bail discharge when the magistrate granted bail to these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first aspect on which we must make up our minds is: What is the right attitude to be adopted between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we adopt the line followed by Sergeant Holmwood who mixes with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and has no trouble with them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we must come down on the side of more lenient treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They at first stated that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been fighting between themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The police altered them for the benefit of the Royal Commission so that they stated the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were fighting with the policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the police officers in car 2 arrived the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were peaceable, acting lawfully, unaffected by liquor and there was nothing in their behaviour then to call for police action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were locked up and were let out on bail the other day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is insufficient for the Minister to state that we are now doing something on a national basis in relation to drunkenness amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the crocodile tears that are shed from time to time for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether this Supreme Court decision will in any way conflict with the application of Australian law generally, particularly in relation to any future actions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under their tribal laws which may be in direct conflict with Australian laws? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister prepared to consider giving a direction that staff ceilings should be reviewed in the Aboriginal employment section of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, in view of the fact that the unemployment level among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has reached 30 per cent or roughly 6 times the national average? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Attorney-General give consideration to the report of the Joint Commonwealth and West Australian commission into incidents between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton in Western Australia which was tabled in this place by the Minister on Thursday, 6 May, to ascertain whether any breach of Commonwealth law is disclosed in the findings of the commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of statistics cited by the  Australian Financial Review  of 17 May 1976 showing that the rate of unemployment amongst Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is as high as 30 per cent, will the Minister, perhaps in co-operation with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and also the Department of Social Security take immediate steps to ensure that this abnormally high rate of unemployment is reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have already had interdepartmental meetings and ministerial meetings of several Ministers with regard to opportunities for employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> desire to take legal action will the Minister provide the necessary funds to ensure that counsel can be provided for the applicants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, recently arrived migrants and other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the timetable with regard to the introduction of the land rights legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but I am quite sure that the assumption that the Minister for the Northern Territory and members of the Country Party have combined to wreck the legislation is inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 3 years of Labor Government the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for the first time in this country, were treated as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As no money has trickled into the Aboriginal community, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have had to sit down and watch these houses being built in their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission is concerned at the low health status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area and attributes this to multiple deprivations in the socioeconomic sense, especially the high rate of unemployment and associated alcoholism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with Commonwealth Government financial assistance, the Health Commission has endeavoured to take special measures to alleviate the health situation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area and these include the employment of a medical officer and of a nurse and full-time Aboriginal health worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the introduction of Medibank with effect from 1 July 1975, has removed some of the financial constraints that might otherwise have restricted health care for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If inflation is the primary evil and everything else- childcare, legal aid, health, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, unemployment- must all be sacrificed to this great goal of destroying inflation, how does one explain the proposition that we should all go out and spend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have had some anxiety over the introduction of the legislation, and its early introduction- if it has not been introduced already- will be welcomed by all people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that at the present time a Queen’s Counsel who acted for the Warburton tribe is at Warburton seeking instructions from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were locked up on 5 January 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much more has to be done in the future to obtain better relationships between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the European citizens and the police force at Laverton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The building of houses at Laverton should be accelerated in order to house <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reserve at Laverton should be shifted so that it is closer to the town and so that there can be integration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I sought and obtained some information on this matter recently because of the publication of figures of unemployment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is perhaps one way in which we <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might be able to get control of this country, as we had prior to 1788. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Maybe this is being taken into account by many of those people who criticise the Government for what it is doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because, as I understand it, we have one of the highest birth rates of any race in this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I add to that recommendation that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders ought to be consulted in the making of those regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those terms, if the honourable senator would allow me to give him the information later in the day I think that that would satisy the interest that he has in the public works program for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mere words and figures do not of themselves reflect the diversity of programs and projects undertaken nor the divergent problems of urban, fringe dwelling and remote communities of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with which the Government must cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A recent national seminar funded by the Government on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and alcohol recommended the use of predominantly Aboriginal staff in treatment programs, that courts and ambulances refer Aboriginal alcoholics and problem drinkers to Aboriginal services and that Aboriginal police steering committees be set up in each State to co-operate on the legal aspects of drunkenness and arrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the Government does not care what happens to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia, and honourable senators opposite who have acquiesced in this measure have succumbed to the worst racist measure this country has seen in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that these people are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is irrelevant and immaterial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that people, whether they be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or other people, are entitled to the protection of the Government as all Australian people are entitled to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are deprived of satisfactory health care, welfare benefits, education and housing while the Government determines the ‘indiscriminate spending’ will be eternally grateful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other States have this problem too; perhaps it is more noticeable in Western Australia because I think there are more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While all this is going on, or not going on depending on one’s viewpoint, what is happening to those people who are dependent on those grants for accommodation, people such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article is headed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘ Shelters Being ‘Destroyed ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to read part of it to give an indication of what the Government of Western Australia has not done in the area of housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allegations were made today that shelters in East Perth were deliberately being destroyed in an apparent attempt to get rid of homeless <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Betsie  Buchanan, an official of the Campaign Against Racial Exploitation, said <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were being forced to sleep out in the rain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Buchanan said a clump of trees in what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> call ‘The Flats’ near the Jewell Street Bridge had been a popular sleeping spot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Off Lord Street, there had been a shelter for 20 people or so, which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had made by spreading sheet iron between 2 brick walls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The structure- in the old Millars woodyard and known by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as ‘Millars Cave’, had been bulldozed down a month or two ago, she said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that there would be a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who would be quite happy to accept a sentence of 3 months in Western Australia just to know that for that period of time they would have food and shelter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Buchanan  goes on to say:  it was conservatively estimated that more than 200 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were forced to live outdoors in the metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this affluent Western society of ours in which we say to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: You will live our life style or you will not live’, we suggest that we might consider putting up caravan park facilities in the bush outside the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they over-ordered and this is one way to get rid of them- give 32-volt lighting to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the reserve and make them use up those lamps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bathurst Island Council made that decision unanimously and it is worthy of note that that body is comprised wholly of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Georges  would acknowledge, there are difficulties in providing the type of employment that can be made available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in remote communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the provision of funds, it should be understood that the Treasurer announced in the Budget when giving the allocation this year for Aboriginal programs and fundings that as we determine appropriate and beneficial programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> further funds will be forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I present the report of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders on the reference relating to the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites, together with a copy of the official  Hansard  transcript of evidence taken during the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is indeed an historic day for me and I hope it will be for all other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because the report just presented marks the culmination of what I understand has been the first completely national examination of the circumstances of the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was agreed on a motion by my colleague  Senator Baume  that the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders be appointed to complete the reference and present the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, first of all, absolutely no doubt that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders generally are culturally, socially and economically deprived with a consequent psychological scarring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report brings into the stark light of reality, I believe, iniquity of many kinds which is Stil being inflicted upon <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things we have to contend with education systems and health services which inadequately serve our real needs, with the meanest standards of housing and, especially where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders live in isolated communities and settlements, deficient community infrastructure services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long ago as 1837, a House of Commons Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> (British Settlements), which examined the situation of indigenous people in a number of British settlements around the globe, made these statements in relation to the Aboriginal people of Australia or New Holland, as it was described in the Committee’s report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of us in the present era may well be appalled that for the next 130 years the iniquity continued largely unabated, sheer cruelty abounded until, with the passage of the referendum in 1967, we illuminated the dark scene, we crossed the watershed and the Commonwealth was given an adequate measure of responsibility in Aboriginal affairs and was drawn deeply and directly into the task of bettering the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and altering their status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those virtues are indicative of the concern of those Australians who do care how the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as such senators, staff and Australians in general continue their endeavours, I am fully confident, as an Aborigine, that the many existing wrongs enfolding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders will be steadily and surely righted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I join with  Senator Bonner  in expressing appreciation and thanks to the staff, whom I am delighted to see sitting in the gallery, and to those who worked on the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders over a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was able to inform the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that money for housing programs would be made available during the current financial year, as soon as the reviews of housing activities have been completed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that land at Borroloola is now being claimed by some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as that tribal area which belongs to a tribe which is now allegedly extinct? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, before the previous election, assured <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that there would be no reduction in their appropriations if they returned a Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall say a few words about violent demonstrations and about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Woodward report promised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were dispossessed of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the psychological sets of the personality were smashed so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could not identify except with shame, embarrassment and cringing at the thought of the once valued images, the ideas that once programmed their personal, social and race identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the handicaps caused by this smashed self-image have never, with the majority of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, found an avenue of healing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was never of the opinion that we should seek the worst environment in which to put <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a crime it is for a sophisticated group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to want something better than what is being provided by Housing Commissions throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party came to power with a plan- it was in our policy speech in 1972- to house all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in suitable accommodation within a 10-year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Senate had commissioned a select committee to inquire into the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the policy of the Government is not to house all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within 10 years, it is an alteration of the objectives given to the Department when Labor was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now says definitely that there shall not be this objective of housing all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hay recommends greater utilisation of State housing commissions or similar agencies on terms, including consultation with and employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to be negotiated; possible absorption of unsuccessful housing associations in remote areas into community councils with residual responsibilities confined to allocation, rentals and maintenance; continued financial support to successful housing associations in remote areas with absorption into community councils being adopted where feasible; encouragement of successful or potentially successful associations in other than remote areas, but on the basis of a loan or a combination of grant and loan; in remote areas, access by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to housing on terms no less favourable than those generally available through housing commissions, and in the absence of housing commission facilities alternative possibilities such as the Department of Construction, private contractors or resource groups serving several councils be investigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If contracts for Aboriginal housing are let to builders we stop the achievement that Fraser and Viner praised yesterday at Wilcannia- the employment opportunities, the pride in achievements and the work of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for their own betterment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we visited there the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got up at daylight and started pouring concrete to finish their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike many homes built previously for Aboriginal communities, these homes have been built according to the choice of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and they are proud of their achievement, and happy to live in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole situation in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is still under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cavanagh  devoted the rest of his time to speaking about violent demonstrations and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support the call which he made to condemn the Budget on the grounds that (a) it pursues a policy of unemployment as a weapon to reduce real wages and salaries; (b) it reduces the availability of services to the whole community but particularly to those most vulnerable to hardship notably <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the unemployed and migrants; and (c) it fails to institute selective stimulatory expenditure to reduce unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the first time the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had land rights; for the first time we had a bilingual program based on the assumption that for an Aborigine to establish his identity he needs his land, his language and his culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made the point, which I support entirely, that there was more real development since that term is becoming popular, in terms of self-determination for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 3 years of the Labor Government than in the 23 years previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have learnt a lot more about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than senators on the other side who are trying to interject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General give consideration to the report of the Joint Commonwealth and West Australian commission into incidents between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton in Western Australia which was tabled in this place by the Minister on Thursday, 6 May, to ascertain whether any breach of Commonwealth law is disclosed in the findings of the commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now want to deal with the problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But unemployment amongst Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is as high as 30 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of statistics cited by the  Australian Financial Review  of 1 7 May 1976 showing that the rate of unemployment amongst Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is as high as 30 percent, will the Minister, perhaps in co-operation with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and also the Department of Social Security take immediate steps to ensure that this abnormally high rate of unemployment is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have already had interdepartmental meetings and ministerial meetings of several Ministers with regard to the opportunities for employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is a scandalous situation- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the people most in need in this Budget but they are the people getting the least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the dinner at the Lodge recently when the Prime Minister said that the best thing that could happen to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was that all of them be moved to Tasmania and towed to the Antarctic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that statement reflects not only his attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but his attitude to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cut down expenditure in many fields, including accommodation for the aged, homeless persons, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, hospitals, health- all sorts of capital works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hay Committee report on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a different kettle of fish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was provided in the Budget that there would be certain specified expenditure for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Budget Speech includes this very important statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is not the fault of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood that  Senator Keeffe  was a man who favoured helping <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying in the little time which remains to me that it is in areas such as this that there is a real risk that what has been expended to date will be wasted unless the Government is able to marshall its forces, get the money together and, more importantly, get the right people involved so that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can gain the benefit of what has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should mount a genuine and viable operation which will do the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> some long term good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we want to see are many examples of the sort of thing the Prime Minister saw on Monday, examples of projects in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are involved and where, because of their involvement and success, there ceases to be problems of drunkenness, neglect and other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>it reduces the availability of services to the whole community but particularly those most vulnerable to hardship notably <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the unemployed and migrants; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been allocated Sim less than in 1975-76 despite the fact that the present Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott),  when he was the Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, promised before the last general election that there would be no cut whatsoever in the moneys to be made available for Aboriginal services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The incidence of unemployment is even greater among some disadvantaged groups, such as young females, young people generally in nonmetropolitan areas, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and young migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some may be, but I would say that a lot would be living off the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not live off the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, very much money has been spent on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from which they are not receiving a benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst  Senator Cavanagh,  who is trying to interject, is probably a genuine person I would say that when the Labor Government of which he was a member made the declaration that 5100m, or an amount of that proportion, was being allocated for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> all it was interested in doing was to wave the flag and say: Look what we have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, I refer to grants to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to what was immediately the conclusion of the Opposition and the Press that an amount of $33m was to be removed, that there was to be a reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the affairs of the company were not inquired into by  Mr Hay,  will the Minister have an immediate inquiry made into the efficiency of this company and do something to assist this most praiseworthy group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cuts in capital works, programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, social welfare, housing and regional development have served the inequalities in the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most critical areas of unemployment are amongst the young, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea I am getting across is that on 8 April I tabled in the Senate the report of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders on the environmental conditions of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we have been waiting on the Hay report there has been chaos within the Aboriginal community, within the Aboriginal Medical Service, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service, in the housing societies and the building societies that were created by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me read a letter that was sent to one of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an account owed to solicitors who dealt with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Legal Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They worked for that service and rendered their services because they were told that the money that would be allocated to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Legal Service would be forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these solicitors do not work for the legal service, how many more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders will not be represented in court, will be railroaded into gaol, will not understand court procedures and will not be able to stand up for themselves because money is not being made available for legal services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my city of Ipswich the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Medical Service received a letter recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately I do not have it with me but it was from the headquarters of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Community Health Service in Brisbane and said that because of the cutbacks in government expenditure on Aboriginal affairs, in future <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would have to pay for their own prescriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will happen unless Governments understand the problems that we are facing and continue to make money available to better the conditions under which unfortunately a great percentage of my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to live at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>it reduces the availability of services to the whole community but particularly to those most vulnerable to hardship notably <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the unemployed and migrants; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area embodied in the amendment moved by  Senator Wriedt  is the hardship which this Government’s Budget has created for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a supporter of a Government which is undoing everything that the Labor Government did in its 3 short years of office to uplift <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to do everything that it could to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt those recommendations are causing  Senator Bonner  very great concern because he now realises that this Government- through its then shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Ellicott-  during the election campaign promised the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that it would not cut by one cent the appropriation by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> constituted one of those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guess where the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly will put the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If aspirins are to be dished out <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be the last to get them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a real determination to take the Aboriginal Legal Service out of the hands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to put it under some other umbrella. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Bonner  said here earlier tonight in another debate, if you take the Legal Service away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the Aboriginal people will not patronise it because they fear seeking assistance through the normal channels from which the average Australian seeks assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that 90 per cent of it happened under this Government and that 90 per cent of the misery that has been caused to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been caused under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been granting land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for several years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was certainly not the main consideration of the Government that the wastage or inefficiencies that were referred to were related to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, the investigation was undertaken to assess the programs and their effectiveness and the way in which services were being delivered to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When these reviews have been completed and the Government is able to determine those projects and programs which are of great benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and those which will be effective in achieving our objectives the Government will make more money available for Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In housing a complete reassessment of Aboriginal housing programs has been instituted to investigate allegations of waste and extravagance and to establish the most efficient ways of providing housing to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in urban, rural and remote situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s decision to introduce a new system of family allowances paid to wives will provide a substantial increase in income for many Aboriginal families and reduce the demands on some programs that were necessary for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all these factors being taken into consideration and with the Government’s commitment to provide additional funds when the reviews which are at present being undertaken are completed, I believe that we will be able to meet our commitment to improve the opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to enhance their opportunities for self-management and other objectives which are our stated policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the general approach to Aboriginal services is concerned, I do want to assure him of the Government’s intention to see that these are developed in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as soon as we are able to determine the best ways in which we can provide increased expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those honourable senators whom one would accept as the more liberal of the conservative elements on that side are all satisfied today that it was only a question of time before  Mr Lynch  made provisions in his Budget with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Hay Committee, which is the justification for the cutting of expenditure, was set up to defeat the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Additionally, it is estimated that 546 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and 93 non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be employed in administration and house construction during 1976-77 compared to 660 and 1 1 1 respectively for 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also plan to reduce the employment in the administration area of housing from 660 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to 546 and from 1 1 1 Europeans to 93. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protests may achieve some results; but the denial of rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was highlighted in the Minister’s Press release of 18 August, which stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory are not affected by that increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Funds will be provided to meet wages for 311 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed on award wages to undertake various activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want the money now so that there will be no halting Aboriginal activities throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill proposed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders be given legislative protection to ensure that when written records of review, confessions, or oral confessions, are given to police officers investigating the commission of offences, the Aborigine or Islander concerned completely understands the nature of the questions put to him and the fact that he has the right to remain silent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, it provides safeguards for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders to ensure that they not only know they have the right to be silent but also that, in the heat of the investigative process, the enthusiasm of the police officers does not lend itself to improper short cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders must be advised of their right to be silent as well as have full understanding of the questions being posed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difference in language, education, culture, and general background between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders and their interrogators makes the safeguards proposed by this Bill worthy, I believe, of the support of all honourable senators in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators would be aware that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have problems understanding the English language because of differences of language, culture and education of society in which they live, where the English language spoken may bear very little resemblance to that used in this House, or, wherever English language concepts cannot be accurately translated into Aboriginal language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable  Mr Justice  Forster and, as you see, with the concurrence of his brothers Muirhead and Ward, recognised a problem, and at least in the Northern Territory- one of the present ‘hot beds’ of Aborigine-police relationssaw that it was of such importance, that certain guidelines were laid down for police to observe when dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not be interrogated when drunk or tired or for unduly long periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal assistance be obtained if sought by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are those honourable senators who are thinking that the proposed Bill is weighted in favour of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders and gives them an advantage over other Australians, then 1 would again draw freely on the learned Judge Forster, who says on page 9 of his reasons for judgment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words,  Mr Justice  Forster has gone as far as he can in his court and has locally dealt with the accepted conduct of police investigations of offences alleged to have been committed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special need experienced by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in respect of oral and written confessions springs out of a real difficulty they experience when conversing in English; a real ignorance as to their civil rights; a real ignorance of the law, and a different set of social values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that the authorised person needs to be one who has had some experience in dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders, has empathy for us <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders and our culture and has knowledge of the law, or at least knowledge as to the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to ensure that lawful conduct by police officers is efficiently carried out in respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to Aboriginal affairs, the Government promised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Aboriginal organisations that there would be no cut backs in expenditure and that they would be better off, not worse off, under a Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the houses be available only for rent, or will <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be allowed to purchase their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs and a committee which is looking at matters with regard to projects for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are working as speedily as possible to determine programs which will be able to be developed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am able to say quite clearly that it is not true that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not employed extensively throughout the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make it perfectly clear that those who tend to say in the first place that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not involved in government mattersin health, education or otherwise- are in fact not accurately reporting the scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it extremely interesting that the number of housing units to be built by the State Housing Commission for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> following the August Budget is only 100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to know how the Government can continue to maintain a funding at this level knowing the existence of errors within the Australia Council, those errors having been revealed in the past by various examinations, and then learning quite recently that while the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was in New Zealand the administrator of the Australia Council travelled across to New Zealand together with her daughter- they travelled first class- and took with them 64 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who did not travel first class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In support of her case for the need for legal aid services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>  Senator Ryan  referred to the necessity to pass the Bill which was introduced into this chamber by  Senator Bonner,  the purpose of which is the protection of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the making of confessions and statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It duplicates the normal common law rights of any individual who is interrogated at a police station but also provides some additional rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by requiring that when they are being interrogated they must have present a witness who can sign a statement to the effect that what has been stated is a true and frank confession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In most cases, yes, because not to pay it would leave solicitors and others with debts for services which they have provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and it would be unfair for those people to suffer as a result of the misdoings of the legal services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders was right earlier this year when it stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all right to challenge the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and try to make a scapegoat of one or two officials of some Aboriginal organisation who say that they will not bow to Treasury regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that quite a deal of that drop can be attributed to the fact that for the first time in many generations the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia were in many cases receiving adequate legal representation and hence were not languishing in the prisons of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand that with the way the courts operate, the way the legal system has operated and the way the police have operated there can readily be an overdose of enthusiasm to provide legal assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in New South Wales going beyond the limitations of some arbitrary budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that what was referred to by  Senator Chaney, Senator Georges  and  Senator Rae  will also be helpful to the Minister as he reviews this important service for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rape with which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were charged occurred some 48 hours before her death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was Minister for Police and Customs I instituted an investigation into what went wrong; into why, with such convincing evidence, we charged <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the murder of that girl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of that investigation, which the Minister who is presently responsible for this matter will not release to me, showed that the person responsible for the death of this girl was someone other than the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were associated with the rape, although the rape was a contributing factor to the death of the girl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that there has been some misappropriation of moneys and some wasteful use of money in some areas is no reason to condemn the legal aid service provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He tells me that he has a certain amount of freedom and that he is able to go out and talk to groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to see whether they have any problems, simply to sit and have a cup of tea with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he arrived at the Little Sisters of the Poor hospitalthat is one of the few places to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Kalgoories can go- he said, ‘They thought I was a white man’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say to those honourable senators who expressed an interrest in this subject that it would be useful for them to visit such places and to see how unpaid people, working under extremely difficult conditions which I doubt I could stand for three or four days let alone for years as these people have done, are working in a way which directly is improving the welfare of the homeless and the itinerant <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the eastern gold fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply draw to the attention of the  Senator that  the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders was concerned with this problem and with the undue contribution it makes to the death of Aboriginal children in Australia who, operating as these children often do on the basis of marginal nutrition, are particularly susceptible to gastro enteritis which plays a disproportionate role in the excess mortality we see among Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked about rural health centres in the Northern Territory, how many were being constructed, how many were in the planning stages, where the centres were situated, whether there were any staffing problems, what Aboriginal staff were being employed, whether any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were being trained and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that whilst we are trying to find employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, encourage them and assist them in education and health, gradually their numbers in the Northern Territory are dwindling and the across the board cuts in the Northern Territory are a washout, are not working and are not good for the health of the Northern Territory community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because the Legal Aid Service offices we set up could not supply counsel for all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> appearing before the courts, rather than employ additional lawyers full time, if they were available, and keeping them on the staff to be employed only at some time or other, there was always the problem that the Department could never budget for the amount required to pay for counsel briefed outside the Legal Aid Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we need a more unusual example of the problem of the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, perhaps I should refer to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who move out of their jobs more frequently than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That matter finds sympathy not only with me but also with members of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders on which I served for some considerable time and which was looking into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a preamble to the question I would like to say that I believe that with the growing awareness of the need to have vocational training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory there appears to be some vying and possible overlapping of interest within government departments in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister able to make a statement on the negotiations between the relevant government departments concerning the future of vocational training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions have taken place on a number of occasions at ministerial level between me, my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and at officer level, to see what facilities we can provide to enable better vocational training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the schools and colleges, but even more importantly, how we can arrange a link between the community outside and the schools and colleges so that we can orient the Aboriginal students from the schools or the colleges to a meaningful job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the sad facts can be demonstrated in this way: In Australia at the moment more than 1 3 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are receiving secondary grants under ABSEG- the Aboriginal Secondary Education Grants scheme- out of a total recognised population of no more than 150 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although, on the one hand, that is good news, on the other hand the fact is that of those 13 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> too low a percentage is going into meaningful employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter of education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a very specialised area, was in great vogue just a few short years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can enter another camp where the facilities in theory are excellent- the buildings are sturdy, the toilets automatically flush but one finds that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves reject what would appear to be a reasonable transitional social stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have said it was given to the Executive members of that Committee, as the Government would not call in the whole 41 members because it really does not want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to know what it is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think he even went so far a week or so ago as to say that that was the first kind thing that he had heard me say regarding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many remarks have been made, not specifically in this chamber, by many people about the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and about retaining and safeguarding Aboriginal lore, but so many people do not understand the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under this amendment we seek to put in an extra section which will take away the right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have identified and have placed on the register a place as ‘a site specially protected under a law of a State or Territory by reason of its association with the history, culture or beliefs of Aboriginals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does seem to me that that proposal in the legislation undermines the very principles of the original legislation which was to give the right to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at least to identify and to have included in the National Estate the sites that they regarded as being of historic importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill which I am now introducing reflects the Government’s careful consideration of many and varied views on this matter and is a tangible indication of this Government’s commitment to the principle that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders should be as free as other Australians to determine their own future and to take their rightful place as citizens in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a very real manifestation of the growing recognition throughout Australia of the validity and strength of Aboriginal society- which, I might add, is clearly acknowledged in the election policy statement of the Government parties on Aboriginal affairs which recognises a special obligation ‘to provide opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to preserve their traditions, languages and customs from further encroachment and destruction where possible ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Land councils will continue to represent Aboriginal traditional owners in negotiations over land use, over mineral developments, and will be further strengthened, in line with the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Woodward, by giving them the function of assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to bring forward land claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Membership will be chosen by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will provide the administrative contact point with Governments, miners and all who may wish to have dealings with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerning their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner will investigate and report on traditional claims to land which lies outside reserves, being claims in respect of vacant Crown land or of alienated Crown land held by, or on behalf of, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also requires the Land Commissioner to inquire into the likely extent of traditional land claims by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to alienated Crown land and to report to the Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and the Northern Territory, from time to time, the results of his inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the Commissioner will only consider these properties if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> submit claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This important provision allows a level of protection hitherto unknown over land held by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and will allow them to consider mining plans carefully before they assent to exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have agreed to mineral exploration the Bill provides, as  Mr Justice  Woodward proposed, that development of any economic discovery made would follow, subject only to agreement on terms and conditions, provided that the development is substantially in accord with the proposals consented to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the responsibility of the Minister to determine the proportion of royalty that will be payable to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in excess of the current rates, fixed by law, should the Government determine that a higher rate of royalty will apply to particular minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, negotiations between the companies and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> break downwhich experience to date suggests will not occur- the Bill will provide that a lease of Aboriginal land may be granted on terms and conditions decided by an arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have defined the nature of the Aboriginal land rights we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with traditional rights to use and occupy that land- a fundamental provision missing in the Labor Government’s Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also provided for an arbitrator to be appointed where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and mining companies are unable to reach agreement on terms for mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the passage of legislation to grant land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory will be a most significant and progressive step in the social and political history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will, at long last, signal Australia’s acceptance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a people having a unique and distinct culture within Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is a major step forward for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory not only for this generation but also for future generations who will benefit from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The companies have put the view to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that the project cannot, for cost reasons, provide further payments on a direct basis to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Representatives of the mining companies concerned have made clear their intention to have extensive discussions with the Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before mining plans are formulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all existing lands designated as Aboriginal reserves be handed over to the respective Aboriginal groups, and that the land be effectively controlled and owned by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area under their law and customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Aboriginal lands include total rights to all natural resources, and that present mining and prospecting be suspended until negotiations are held with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That any ‘Crown Lands’ which are of traditional or sacred significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be ceded to them in perpetuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all sites of anthropological or traditional significance to Aboriginals other than those on reserves or crown land be opened to the use of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> without fees or constraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The hearing of Aboriginal claims have been postponed as a result of Government decisions, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not be penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a) The removal of all powers to pass Land Rights Legislation from Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, particularly its control over sacred sites, entry permits, control over the seas adjoining Aboriginal land, the fishing rights of non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enter pastoral stations and control of wildlife on Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this Bill has received wide publicity and great support in the electorate, particularly where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are largely congregated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after his appointment,  Mr Wentworth  stated in a letter to me that the 1967 referendum gave the Commonwealth concurrent powers with the States in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other practitioner at the time was James Weirick, l andscape consultant and subsequently I invited Tony Wood of ACI Fibreglass to design the fibreglass structure of the water tower and Malcolm Campbell,  Chairman  of the FRP Division of the Plastic Institute of Australia to train and supervise the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the use of fibreglass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health situation in this area and the whole of the north coast is bad among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and prevalent in all age groups . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every time it rains in Alice Springs 1000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get wet, cold and sick because they have no shelter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Kimberley <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and probably all W.A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it has made the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a political football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is from the journal  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders of Weipa,  notes on background and current position, October 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sites of significance m the Weipa area have been raped and plundered over a period of 20 years and even now the Weipa <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> speak of their places in whispers because they fear despoilment by yet another bulldozer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also means, if honourable senators care to look at some of the last lot of amendments to the legislation, that this Government has now made it watertight for the mining interests at Borroloola because they will never have to contest anything if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want to put a claim in for the area as their claims for that area are not going to be heard under this new amended legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Methodist Church of Australia, the Quaker Race Relations Council, the Presbyterian Church of Australia, the Congregational Union of Australia and the United Church of Australia have all come out in support of full land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now know as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of the representatives of this Parliament on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, as a member of the committee that worked under the chairmanship of  Senator Keeffe  to examine the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, and as a member of the committee which under the chairmanship of  Senator Bonner  brought in the report on the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, it gives me a special pleasure to be able to take part in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land rights will assist one group of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to function in a way they want to function and to get a fairer share of what exists in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it wholly wrong to encourage <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to think that because their ancestors have had a long association with a particular piece of land, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the present day have the right to demand ownership of it. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that the Legislative Assembly will favour the white pastoralists, who is one who comes and goes, who lease the land but do not value the land as we the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well the people up in Darwin know what is going on here and know what could benefit the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that he believed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> seek correction and justice in respect of past mistakes but they do not, to the best of his knowledge, seek to achieve this by turning the sword of discrimination against their non-Aboriginal neighbours’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before they say yes, the Northern Land Council or whoever has the legal backing should go and assist the Aboriginals straight away, wherever they got a mineral find, and really get it legally set up for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will say yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elders also gave an assurance they did not want to ‘take over’ cattle stations in the Centre and were quite happy for pastoralists to continue, providing their- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- title to the land was recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> telegrammed the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Viner,  and asked him to come to their meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year the field superintendent of the Finke River Mission, Pastor Paul Albrecht, and the superintendent at Hermannsburg,  Mr Garry  Stoll, who both speak Aranda fluently, translated the proposed Bill to various groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paster Albrecht said the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were shocked that the Bill would not recognise Aboriginal law and asked that he and  Mr Stoll  bring back a tape recorder and ‘take our words to the Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after last week’s meeting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> felt their words were not being listened to and they decided to draw up a petition to present to both Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, Aboriginal law did not permit an organisation or body made up of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from different clans to speak on behalf of, advise of otherwise deal with any traditional landowning group in relation to its land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who had spent  2Vi  days meeting under a shady tree on the Lutheran mission block, also decided on the unusual step of inviting the Press to their meetings so that everyone should know their feelings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Land Council and Land Trust would not work because Aboriginal law did not allow a body of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> made up from different clans to speak for or hold title for any traditional land-owning group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is ‘owned’ by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- there is no ‘vacant Crown land’ such as Europeans recognise- they would be quite happy for land to be made available for non-tribal groups, providing an arrangement was made with the traditional owner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that this apparently representative group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has made its stand their only worry is that the Government will not listen before the Bill is pushed through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that he is ohe of the most experienced men in Aboriginal matters now, in clan ownership, in understanding the traditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that under this Bill the title of the land will be in the hands of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very proud to be one of those people who played a part in granting those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> this lease of land way back before such a system was considered anywhere else in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are also contrary to a report of the bipartisan Senate committee which inquired into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and which recommended a redrafting of this Bill now before us to re-establish Commonwealth power over all Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I would like to say that I find it a rather tragic irony that, while we all say that we want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have the land that they own and while we all say that we want legislation that will give them this land, we find ourselves going through an extremely convoluted and technical series of Bills, amendments, amended Bills and debates which are a product of our political system in order to say to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: ‘If you want to have what you properly own, these are the conditions that you will have to fulfil’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also find it a sad reflection upon the current attitude of European Australians to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that there is only one Aboriginal member of Parliament here to debate this legislation, which is of such major significance to his people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that those supporters of the Government who have expressed such strong emotional support for the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will give action to those sentiments by supporting the amendments which we will be moving solely to improve the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of  Mr Justice  Woodward, who was given a commission by the Labor Government in 1973 to report upon the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in and in relation to land and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to rights in or in relation to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as one who worked with  Mr Ellicott  in the Party committees, I believe that he brought a very great depth of sympathy and understanding to the questions relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that came before the coalition Parties during that time and I believe that he made an immense personal contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the understanding which he gained during his presentation of the Commonwealth ‘s case in that suit had done a great deal for the present Government Parties in increasing their understanding of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this enure nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Bonner  can look at his resolution and say that, with respect to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have maintained a traditional tie to the land, we are fulfilling the demand which he made on us and which we endorsed in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the fact that our Parties’ policy is to set up certain funds which will be used for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My personal view- I stress that it is a personal view- is that we ought to try to get Government assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on to the basis that it is regarded as something received as compensation for the dispossession of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Blackburn in his judgment refers to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ relationship to land which has no comparison, no parallel, in our law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have tried to do in this Bill - I think it is flexible enough to permit it- is to ensure that what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves say is their title can be allowed to continue to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the right to prevent exploration for them on their traditional lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only an expression of  Senator Bonner’s  opinion about the entitlements of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been told that he has worked assiduously through the campaign to have alterations made to the legislation, and now we have reached the stage of taking this memorable action to have before us a Bill which gives land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the beginning of the restoration of land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation before us is limited to those traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who, in many cases, cannot be found today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that- to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President  and honourable senators, approximately 27 000 fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the tribal situation in the Northern Territory, those who are the inheritors of your recognised prior ownership, now desire their traditional land to be safeguarded by the Bill before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My brother <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> look to you,  Sir, and  to honourable senators and we ask you- we even beg, if necessary- for justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land ownership to my fellow tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a continuing dynamic motion and is not,  Sir, bounded  by the geographical limits of a government surveyor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps in this chamber this evening the white people will have some concept of what land means to my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe this is not the perfect Bill, but it is a Bill which represents the final recognition by a government that the traditional Aboriginal people, my traditional fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, are to be given title to their traditional lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only am I concerned but also many of my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have some little suspicions because there are many interested people, many people with vested interests in Northern Territory land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to quote from the Woodward report, as it sums up why perhaps there will be some suspicions by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly me- although I hope to be in this chamber for a long time yet and I will be keeping a close watch on what transpires henceforth in relation to this land rights Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from a section of the Woodward report which sums up what has happened to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> since 1788. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory were established for the protection of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However there seems to be no point in exploring these problems; provided <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are finally given tide to land described by geographic boundaries and not by past history, no difficulties should arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not happen because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be given title to the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was regarded by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a disaster in Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay and urged the Australian Government to . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government, this Opposition, this Australian Labor Party, which was supposed to be the champion of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or course, at that seminar stress was placed on the fact that malnutrition in the sense of bad diet was affecting primarily <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that, in terms of mature aged diabetics, we had a problem of obesity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan, when you have lived as an Aborigine and have been subjected to all the things to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been subjected, you can point the finger at me, but until that time all I ask of you is that you hear me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier today or last night, this Bill is only catering for some 27 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only catering for 27 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you will be patient and listen to what I have to say I am sure that you will agree with me when I say that this Bill is only catering for approximately 27 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested that the time had come when the Government must recognise the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were once in possession of this nation and should introduce legislation to compensate the said indigenous people for the loss of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that has happened is that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been the recipients of charity- charity of the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen in the future is that as governments change and the attitudes of people change, so will the amount of money allocated for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> change, according to the will of the government of the day or its sympathy or non-sympathy or whatever the case may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, under the terms of my motion, the setting up of a compensation fund to be administered by competent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the setting up of a statutory body, would enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to use the money to which they are justly entitled in compensation for their dispossession of almostexcept for that provided for under this Bill- the entire nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not be satisfied and I know that thinking <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will never be satisfied until the governments of this country recognise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as the original owners of this entire nation and bring in compensation for dispossession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The move had dangerous implications for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who lived on reserves in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year legislation to allow the Government to approve mining activity on reserves had been shelved after widespread protests by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not with the State Government that we have in office at the present time in Western Australia but which will change in the early months of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allegations are being made of Aboriginals resident on the mission at Beagle Bay being ‘ripped off’- I think was the expression used at one stage by the missionaries or the administrative committee that was managing the mission- and the administrative committee that was managing the mission- and the frustration of the architects who were endeavouring to set up housing facilities and sewerage facilities for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments being proposed by the Government are not adequate and no matter what we on the Opposition side do with amendments we are never going to be able to re-arrange a Bill and give it the substance that is necessary for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have complete control of the land to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also hope that, as a result of these reviews, the delivery of services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be further improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill fully protects <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that people throughout the length and breadth of Australia have an interest in the proceedings of the Senate today and that they will welcome this first stage in land rights legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand where an Aboriginal community makes a decision there is provision for disallowance very easily of the result- a bylawof <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having a say in their own affairs, but on the other hand in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) BDI, where there is a mining interest, although there is a right for a member of Parliament to move for disallowance of the proclamation, there is no provision that it is to be dealt with within 15 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned, there is today only one cooperative left in the Northern Territory and  Senator Kilgariff  and his Party have been trying to close it down for the past 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an exercising of the Commonwealth’s constitutional powers and responsibility to make special laws for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders where a need is seen for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are thousands of examples of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were supposed to be ripping off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Government was trying to secure a piece of land on which to establish a housing settlement, the Queensland Department would not let <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> build on the original site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise in this debate to make 2 points about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not really have to be a genius to know that the bulk of the money will go to the Commission to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To further my argument I cannot do better than to quote from the report of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders on the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lack adequate housing because they are poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a great extent, the solutions to Aboriginal poverty are the same as those measures designed to eliminate poverty in Australian society generally, but in addition we must take account of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ desire to maintain a distinct cultural identity <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are poor and so they have bad housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, there is not as great a need in Victoria as in some other States but in Victoria under State grants 50 houses were provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1975-76 although the outstanding applications as at 30 June 1976 numbered 160- three times as many as the number of houses provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal housing societies were set up not just to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were also used as testing grounds for the application of new ideas in architecture and environmental design in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points about which the Committee felt strongly was that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as much as any other section of the community had to be given the chance to make mistakes and to learn by their mistakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in Victoria in particular I urge this Government to make more money available so that these tasks may be accomplished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it still seriously looking at the problems of unemployment among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or is it saying: ‘Let us wait until something drastic happens before we go ahead with it’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is tremendous unemployment among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that she referred to the report of the Senate Committee which dealt with housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make the point that, when we were travelling through New South Wales taking evidence on Aboriginal housing needs, we were a little alarmed to learn from the officers who talked to us in various localities that no special arrangements existed to cater for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who would be requiring homes under the Housing Commission program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that it is highly desirable when housing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in urban areas to avoid the collective situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Ryan  mentioned the poor conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why I believe the present Government was determined to reassess the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is evident from the many comments that have been made by honourable senators that housing is a matter of extreme importance to the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a consequential amendment to ensure that where additional leases are granted at Groote Eylandt it will be subject to negotiation of fair terms and conditions with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Woodward noted in relation to oil and gas at paragraph 704 of his report that the financial interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be well served by the appropriation of a 10 per cent royalty payment to their benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may have made some gains, it is the intention of the Government to ensure that the interests of the mining companies are not damaged in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to get up and say what ill treatment we have given <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to make the utterances we have made in support of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is the testing time for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have a traditional claim to their lands or, as we heard last night, the sacred land of those people which comes out of their dreamtime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can it be dug up in the interests of a mining company without the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having a say? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that it is Government policy to protect the mining interests, but let us get away from the idea that there are great patriots on the other side of the chamber who are concerned about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I as an individual or someone else in this chamber thinks there might be another here or another one there, then it is a matter on which we must weigh up all the concerns and all the entitlements of people involved in the area and do what is best with prime consideration for the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who I think are concerned with this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been over the years dispossessed of their traditional land and have occupied areas of land for a number of years as virtual squatters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make just one other point, which  Senator Missen  has half made for me, by quoting again from the Woodward report, and that is that the number of people involved in these camps around the towns is very small- 2374 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in greater Darwin and 1269 in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can apply to the Trust to have the land purchased and handed to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planning for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in towns must involve consulting them to discover their wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regional Land Councils should each assign an officer to find out the housing requirements of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in towns within the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Land Commission after considering these submissions, making its own investigations and consulting with planning authorities, should make recommendations to the Government concerning the acquisition of the necessary land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a claim made for the site on which Darwin is located, I think it is proper for the Commission- the Commission has looked into the Kulaluk claims- to recommend to the Minister that a particular area should be granted to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had a legitimate claim to the Darwin site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at sub-clause 24 (a) of the Bill they will see that it enables <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to make a register of people whom they consider to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a register of tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with tribal claims who are the owners of the land although they may not live in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have supported him on occasions when he has been acting on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Woodward was thoroughly conscious of the need to provide within Australia domestic law for the traditional interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sake of  Senator Bonner  who did not think the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were very interested or upset about the Government’s Bill, as there are still telegrams and messages coming into my office I thought that I would quote just one because it came from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in fringe areas, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are people in the left wing of the Liberal Party who have a more progressive attitude and who sometimes believe in the rights of people, even minority groups like <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the understandable expectations of these companies that they would be able to continue exploration under the rules which governed them to begin with, are weighed against the equally reasonable expectation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that their wishes about reserve lands will now be respected, I have no doubt in my mind which expectation must be disappointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be writing into the statute a stipulation that the person appointed shall give paramount consideration to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whereas all that is being arbitrated upon is a claim to an interest by a person who has an existing estate as against the Aboriginal community which claims that it has Aboriginal rights over the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in a preferred position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of Oenpelli, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> affected by such agreements and contracts were not consulted as to terms and conditions for the use and exploitation of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control over the issuing of entry permits to non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> visiting Aboriginal lands is much emphasised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general the NACC supports more the original 1 97S Bill, as we understand the previous Australian Government on 16 October 1975, was clearly intent and undisturbed in seeking to grant some real land title to traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it may not provide the ultimate in the protection of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at least it does strengthen their case to a very large degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not agree to mining on their land and if the Governor-General is of the opinion that it is in the national interest, he issues a proclamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the type of employment proposed to be available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in connexion with the activities which the applicant for the grant proposes to carry out upon the land; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters to be negotiated, if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned are prepared to consider the proposal, would include payments for exploration rights, royalty payments and, perhaps, an equity interest in the venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other matters for negotiation would include the protection of sacred sites, Aboriginal employment and the setting up of appropriate liaison arrangements between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a basis for the negotiation the company should produce a statement showing as clearly as possible just what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being asked to agree to at the respective stages of exploration, proving, development and production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first part of the proposed new clause deals with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their entitlement to enter on pastoral leases, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provided that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be entitled to remain on any pastoral lease except within one kilometre of a homestead, to use natural waters and to kill wildlife for food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in terms that a reservation in favour of the Aboriginal inhabitants of the Northern Territory shall be read as a reservation permitting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enter on and be on lease land, to use the natural waters and springs on the lease land and to kill upon the lease land and use for food the birds and animals that are natural to the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Letts, the Majority Leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, has said that this right, for which the Assembly will be responsible unless this amendment is accepted, must be limited to traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give this right, to give this great power, to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is a denigration of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that those honourable senators opposite who really want to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should vote for this amendment and the next three or four amendments because they are at the very crux of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of clause 73, as I referred to earlier, will require Northern Territory ordinances to accord with the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Retrenchment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: Point McLeay Housing Society (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs send a telegram during last week to the Point McLeay Housing Society assuring them that no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be retrenched until an assessment had been carried out on on-going programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were nine <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> retrenched on 17 September 1 976 because of lack of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to an article in the  Sydney Morning Herald  of 7 September 1976, in which his spokesman was reported as stating that the small proportion of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed in Public Service Third Division clerical positions was not the result of educational barriers, and that the Public Service Board waived educational requirements for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is a lack of formal educational qualifications not a barrier preventing the promotion of suitably experienced <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have any in-service training courses been conducted since I January 1976 to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> without matriculation are promoted to Public Service Third Division positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer to (2) is in the affirmative, what are the courses, what has been the duration of these courses, and how many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have attended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many positions have been established to train and develop <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and, of these positions: ( a) how many are filled on a permanent basis; (b) how many on a temporary basis; (c) how many are vacant; (d) have any of the occupants of these positions been transferred to duties not connected with the training and development of Aboriginal staff; (e) if any of the positions are unfilled, or if any officers have been seconded, what is the reason for this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of the training officers responsible for the training of Aboriginal staff within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs are themselves <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What priority does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs give to the training and development program for Aboriginal staff who may lack formal educational qualifications but who, nevertheless, possess qualities that allow them to deal effectively with other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report, however, is misleading because it suggests that the Public Service Board, as a matter of course, waives the educational requirements prescribed by the Public Service Act for entry for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the Third Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3) No in-service training courses are conducted to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or other staff without matriculation are promoted to Public Service Third Division positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No positions are provided exclusively for the purpose of training and developing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, in view of the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) Referendum having been agreed to in 1967, take appropriate action to protect the rights and property, including the reserves of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland if the Queensland Government proceeds in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland Government, through its Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement provides housing at various locations throughout Queensland for rental to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the capital cost of which is funded by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Aboriginal Loans Commission makes loans available to individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for housing in Queensland and during the period July to September 1976, 18 loans amounting to $494,47] were approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder then why we cannot leave it to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to make the decision as to who is to be delegated to issue permits and how that responsibility is delegated, rather than leave it to the remote white, non-assimilated and possibly- I say this calmly this morning- rather racist dominated Country Party members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If determination over those areas is given to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory undoubtedly it will exploit the waters adjoining Aboriginal land, and it may or may not give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> access to any water at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-clause (2) of clause 71 could be used to deprive Aboriginals of the use of land, especially if a person with an interest in that land does not wish to have <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on his land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite still believe that there are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country who do not want the type of amendment which the Labor Party is moving, I shall try to change their minds by quoting again from a selection of telegrams which have arrived this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may be remote but they would not be granted land rights if they were living in the heart of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an abrogation of the Federal responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which was specifically granted to the Commonwealth in the 1967 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement by  Dr Letts  in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and I can provide the  Hansard  reference if it is required although I do not think there is any doubt about it, he suggested that 40 per cent of the tribally oriented <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia probably live in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we look at the number of site recorders, and there have to be site recorders for the effective implementation of an ordinance which deals with protection of sacred sites, although the Northern Territory has 40 per cent of the tribally oriented <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> it has only 5 per cent of the site recorders in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are claiming the right to go back to Quail Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years, as I have pointed out in this debate, on many occasions they have been the first to introduce legislation relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed committee will really have to work 24 hours a day if it is to supervise the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly under its present political composition because most of the people who sit in that Assembly today have no sympathy at all for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and honourable senators opposite know that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  amendments were in accordance with Australian Labor Party policy and in accordance largely with the recommendation of the Woodward report that entry to sacred sites be controlled mostly by the land councils for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land was a gift and therefore the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever may be the political flavour of the Assembly in the future, it is a body that will have control, The question is whether it should have control in preference to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I question the right of  Senator Keeffe  to say that, because  Senator Keeffe  does not represent all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  talks about the Liberal Party not doing very much for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which one of them is representing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certainly no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> among them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are concerned about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For  Senator Bonner  to denigrate what we have done for Aboriginals and to claim that he is the champion of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when he has neglected them all along the line, is simply false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other cases they have given us a greater understanding of the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wherever they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these terms I believe that progressively we will be able to make additional movement towards an understanding of the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps by taking evidence the committee will enable the 30-odd <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the senior departmental officer to clear themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>right of entry upon pastoral properties; (ba) the effect of mining operations, including exploration and prospecting operations, on Aboriginal land or land which is claimed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; and’”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition also wants to add a further paragraph in relation to the effect of mining operations, including exploration and prospecting operations, on Aboriginal land or land which is claimed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether they are going to come from the Legislative Assembly or mining companies endeavouring to act unilaterally or whether there will be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who feel aggrieved because of something that mining companies do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill provides for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to control the making of roads on Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are covered in the Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance, which guarantees Aboriginal rights of entry and movement on pastoral leases and all pastoral leases carry a reservation in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment also proposes additional reference to the effect of mining operations on Aboriginal land or land claimed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be pointed out that the Bill gives <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> power to control exploration and mining operations on their land and the reference is considered unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said yesterday, it is these people who do most damage to the game upon which many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are forced to rely for food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give assurances that the Land Fund Commission will maintain its power to purchase land in all States for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that it will be adequately funded in order to carry out this function effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until 1976 the college was a mission school- as the honourable senator would know, with his close interest in and sympathy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- and it was transferred to the Government in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have any information with regard to the specific matter of selling cattle to these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at $50 a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Social Security been drawn to a report in the  Courier Mail  of 9 February in which it is stated that the Federal member for Griffith,  Mr Donald  Cameron, claims that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Brisbane has formed a cooperative to steal pension and other social security cheques from letter boxes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would be aware that last year the Department of Aboriginal Affairs funded a special health project for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria through that State’s Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was not seeking in any way to escape from the responsibilities which it had, but it did take the opportunity to point out that the matter of Aboriginal education was being considered at that time by the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders as part of its inquiry into environmental conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will recall that on 16 February I asked her about claims made by the Federal member for Griffith,  Mr Donald  Cameron, that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Brisbane had formed a co-operative to steal pensioner and other social security cheques from letter boxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could also be said that an electorate with a large number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would come into this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has done so as  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was proud to be a member of that Committee which produced a report that was something of a hallmark in the development of the recognition of Aboriginal rights and of the situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the man who has on the notice paper a private members Bill in relation to police procedures and confessions by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory royalties on minerals won in reserves have been paid to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund for use as directed by the Minister, on the advice of an all-Aboriginal committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill 1976 be restored to the notice paper and consideration resumed at the stage it had reached in the last session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Affairs, Employment and Industrial Relations, Health, and myself and their departments to determine how we may best assist in regard to employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs wishes me to state that there was a public commitment given by  Dr Letts  that the complementary legislation would be worked out in consultation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and with the involvement and agreement of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of paying <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> what they term ‘sit down money’, they have asked the Government to pay the money to the councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> also visited that country for the Black African Festival of Arts and Culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as myself, as I said, a number of tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the Northern Territory, a group of tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Aurukun in my own State of Queensland and other Aboriginal people from various parts of the Commonwealth attended that festival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone was seeking information about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he would go to that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also establish whether funding will be made available for the Abercrombie project and similar projects designed to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have problems with alcoholism and/or drug abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember recent debates on matters affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when this was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These areas were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, railways and land development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when one looks at the report of the Grants Commission one can see readily that the Queensland Government claimed special difficulties in the areas of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, railways and land development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the Queensland Government claims that there is an added drain on its social welfare services because of the high Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not happen only under a Whitlam Government; the same thing is happening in relation to this Government over the provision of services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unemployment is not, in the immediate sense, a common problem’, it strikes selectively, and most commonly at those most vulnerable to social and economic disruption- the unskilled and semi-skilled, the female school-leavers, the poor, the marginal workforce members, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of these people are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but they can be gainfully employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, under this Government, in the past twelve to fifteen months <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have suffered, as have other disadvantaged minorities in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a return to the pre- 1972 ideas so far as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their needs are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This does not include a terrific number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who do not register as unemployed because they are not near the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and topped this off with gratuitous references to Australia’s treatment of its <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- hinting that this might become a matter of public debate in Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said the Northern Land Council was preparing thousands of leaflets to be sent to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> doubtless without any consultation with the Majority Party, although this would be in the best interests of co-operation and harmony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Letts  said an attempt bordering on hysteria was being made to engender widespread emotional reaction amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Remedial teaching of <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> is relatively inexpensive as a tutor receives $8.50 an hour, is not paid during holidays, and works a maximum of thirteen hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the most vicious intimidatory action I have yet seen any party apply to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The hired bunch of solicitors used as scrutineers completed the program to deprive illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of their right to cast a valid vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a number of statements from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Kimberley electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party used discriminatory tactics against illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Kimberley electorate to intimidate, confuse and deprive of the right to register a valid vote for the candidate they had selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will hesitate before subjecting themselves to such humiliating circumstances in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal electors seek to blame the ALP and discredit the intelligence of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crighton-Browne showed he had never met the Kimberley people when he attempts to discredit them by calling them ‘illiterate bush <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been living on the fringes of towns since 1968. and know governments look after white people while they are left in humpies and tents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alan Ridge should be the last to complain about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being ‘ marshalled ‘ or ‘exploited ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would not let us <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> take in somebody to help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear the redistribution that is to take place in the Northern Territory because I think it, too, will be aimed at the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that this matter was brought forward in the manner in which it was, that is, by talking of broken promises to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rather than by looking constructively at what is being done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the various areas of Government responsibility and acknowledging that much of the plan of the Opposition and of the Government has been put into effect in this past year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said that we intended to increase job opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and that we would support Aboriginal land rights legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know what happened: We know that the Bill was passed through both Houses of Parliament in the last session; we know that it was welcomed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and by the Australian community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we all welcomed the fact that we had a Bill and subsequently had an Act that would be able to represent what we believed to be the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is asserted in a way that there has been a disregard for the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to put the funds for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into perspective, let me state that in the Budget Speech the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  announced that $153m would be allocated for Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we add to this expenditure by other departments, such as my Department, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and others, we realise that a great deal is to be expended to improve the life and opportunities of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do believe that we need constructively to look at programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe a great deal of sensitivity and responsibility needs to be shown with regard to the health standards of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs, through the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  has recognised that it has a particular role to play in the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognises that for historical, social, cultural and economic reasons levels of morbidity and mortality for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> far exceed those of the other ethnic groups in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a responsibility to improve the standards of health and housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We acknowledge that many people, particularly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, suffer from leprosy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a special responsibility to overcome alcoholism amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves and their communities have expressed great concern over the problems associated with the misuse and abuse of alcohol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to point to increased income in the hands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as the cause, yet I believe that many thoughtful people recognise that sometimes increased spending power simply leads to increasing the money that can be used for the abuse of alcohol to the detriment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that we have a great responsibility for the education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assert that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need more opportunities in order to make them equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this will ultimately be one of the keys with which we are able to unlock the cycle of poverty and deprivation which for so long has been the way of life of many of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I hope that this is one way of giving an opportunity to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to move away from many of the difficulties which have been prevalent for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a great percentage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are unemployed was mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that I have a responsibility to the large numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who receive unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also aware, through direct representation by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their elders, that some Aboriginal communities find difficulty in filling in the application forms to enable them to receive the benefits for which they are eligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think we should all like to go one step further than simply facilitating the payment of unemployment benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by looking to constructive ways of providing employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the National Employment and Training Scheme which is operated by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and at the end of November last year this scheme was providing on  the job training for  about 850 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have seen from enrolments for this year, numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have now joined the NEAT scheme and this will give them training which will lead to employment opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special work projects also are operated by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and these have provided employment opportunities for about 600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the past year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there is the vocational training service which increasingly is being used by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it represents a better way of providing ways and means of employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than simply to accept that for people living in remote areas there is no alternative to unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, there have been grants to the States and grants in aid totalling some $3m just as there have been grants to Aboriginal enterprises for employment opportunities totalling $4m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these ways we have been seeking employment and occupation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly for those who had devised programs in which they had special interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all constructive ways in which Aboriginal advancement is pursued and we hope that through them many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will find fulfilment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer to the Minister for Education the matter that was raised to see whether some more specific information can be given about the 104 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in New South Wales who were refused study grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as this Government is concerned programs relating to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where experience has shown that programs are beneficial and where it is shown that we should heed new advice coming to us on ways to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I am quite sure that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be in the forefront in an endeavour to see that these things are achieved on behalf of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in next year’s Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been kept hanging for weeks paying high rents and high interest while awaiting the finalisation of their loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Huts built of canvas and galvanised iron on the river banks are what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live in in many places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are allowed in caravan parks in many places so they move in with relations, as we would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot get rooms at boarding  houses,  hotels or motels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be suggested that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could get justice from the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is off the planet; it is not just high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be treated differently? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in its report stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was not said in 1977; that was said in 1 837 in a report of the House of Commons Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> (British Settlements). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Victorian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say: ‘Being black means saying you are sorry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government has failed to honour its election promises to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been rip-offs not only by non-Aboriginal people but also- and I say this with a great deal of sadness- by some of my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delivery of health services, legal aid, employment opportunities and better education so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can go into better jobs are the areas on which money has to be expended, and it must be expended wisely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government on aboriginalisation and giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> responsibility, I believe that we, the Aboriginal people, must accept that responsibility and ensure that when money is made available we spend it to the benefit of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know of the telegram that was sent out by the then Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal affairs,  Mr Ellicott,  and his avowal that there would be no cuts in programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only people who are not being involved in those inquiries are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was determined by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that this money would be spent on getting together for a meeting people who were concernd about Aboriginal alcoholism and Aboriginal drug abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was pleased that it had been organised and planned entirely by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are generally reformed alcoholic <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He travels all over the State of Western Australia talking to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> about the problems of alcoholism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where are the greatest number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> situated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because here in Canberra we have the European bureaucracy who can dictate to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working in the alcoholism field what they should do, what their priorities should be and where they should be heading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me assure you,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  that there are a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been advised that  Senator Bonner  would be speaking in the debate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because  Senator Bonner  has nothing to communicate to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research teams have been coming up with solutions that have been known to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the last 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirty to forty <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who meet together in Sydney at this time need immediate hospitalisation because of the effects of alcoholism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are dying under trees and on the banks of rivers not only in New South Wales but also in Western Australia because of the effects of alcoholism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> know what they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example of how this Government has failed to recognise the needs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, perhaps the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will provide an answer to a question that has been bothering me for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason which is inexplicable to me-  I  can only assume that the people who are managing the Department of Aboriginal Affairs want as little communication with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as possiblethe office has been moved from Narrogin, which has a high concentration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the immediate vicinity and many more in the outer vicinity, to Bunbury which has relatively few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> tend to stay away from the cities because they recognise that people will not allow them to forget that they are uneducated and will not allow them to move freely without insult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suddenly find that the office of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which was set up in Narrogin and which was doing a tremendous volume of work has been moved to an isolated area where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves will have no further communication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have entered into a contract with the mining organisation which would have provided them with royalties from the sale and mining of the diamonds, would have allowed them to determine which roads and how many roads would be put on their property and other things of this sort was of no consequence to the State Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the Forest River Reserve will get nothing out of the diamonds that have been found at Oombulgurri because the State Government has determined that the large organisation can have the benefit of the diamonds and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> once again can go without. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not moving in any positive area to allow the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine for themselves what should be done in their best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not stand for it any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government has failed to honour its election promises to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the matters brought up by the honourable senator who moved the motion had very little to do with whether the Federal Government had failed to honour its election promises to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but I will come to that in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not aware in any personal way, they are not aware at all except through the media, of the extremities of the problems suffered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in isolated communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Treatment of the sorts of diseases that the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  admits exists widely amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in isolated communities is possible and could be effective if the present Government were prepared to spend money, to supply trained staff and, most importantly, to work with the Aboriginal people in finding solutions to these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the Central <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Congress Medical Service as an example of an effective program of treatment of the health problems of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 doctors and, I think, 3 nurses for 8600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are on thenbooks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, most of those 8600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in very poor health by our standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the problem of nutrition and alcohol, surely it is not beyond any government of goodwill to make adequate protein and calorie diets available where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living on settlements, especially to make it available to pregnant women, to babies and to growing children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when talking about the alcohol problem amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we would do well to bear in mind that it is a problem that we have inflicted on the Aboriginal community and that European-Australians have actually created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I become very embarrassed and disgusted by discussions about Aboriginal alcoholism when they are couched in terms of alcoholism being something that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have brought upon themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot recall anyone saying it in this chamber but surely  Senator Baume  has heard comments to the effect that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot handle alcohol, that they are hopeless and that they are always on the booze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should be looking at ways of taking health, education and social security services out to where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are facilities around Alice Springs, Darwin and other places to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have access but away from these developed centres, in the isolated areas, the facilities are not there but the needs are there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible to provide the basic necessities for good health to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living away from developed areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is white, one of three such species of mankind who accompanied some 33 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on their voyage of discovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> include five dancers from the Aboriginal/Islander Dance Theatre set up in Sydney by Carole Johnson, a black American in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, together with many other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, have become sick and tired of people, particularly non-Aboriginal people, using the derogatory and degrading terms ‘half caste’, ‘part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’, ‘half breeds’ and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This article is not only saying things about particular people- I will deal with that later- but also is using degrading terms, dividing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into part this, part that, quarter this and half that, and driving a wedge also between the tribal or the traditional Aborigine and the de-tribalised urban Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article states that the urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were in Nigeria only for politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> arrived after 52 hours of travelling they found they had nowhere to stay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They forced the issue and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were put into the Echo Hotel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lance Bennett was continually driving a wedge between the urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and I believe that the whole of the wording of the article and the criticism contained within it is the work of Lance Bennett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> put in an appearance the audience was already leaving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lighting system was bad, and it was all the fault not of John Moriarty and the urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were there but of the 2 non-Aboriginal people who claimed that they were running the show and who continually took no notice of Moriarty or Vince Copley, who were the organisers of the whole show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is written up in the Bulletin, and in my opinion it could do a lot of harm, not only to the people who are mentioned in the article but also to the articulate urban Aborigine who in many instances is trying to improve the lot of his fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and other parts of Australia, who unfortunately are not so articulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that they should be denigrated in the way they have been in this article, and I believe that an apology should be given to all the people concerned with the organisation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> going to the festival, and particularly Moriarty, who was the main organiser of the whole thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In early February this year  Mr Donald  Cameron, the Liberal member for Griffith, made the claim that ‘a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had formed a co-operative to steal pension and social security cheques from letter boxes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Federal Parliamentarian claimed last night a group of <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> had formed a co-operative to steal pension and social security cheques from letter boxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Member for Griffith  (Mr Don Cameron)  will be asked to support his allegations about <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> stealing pension and social security cheques from Brisbane letter boxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About ISO <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> from Brisbane areas attended a meeting yesterday to discuss  Mr  Cameron  ‘s allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cameron said on Tuesday that an organised group of <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> was using children to follow postmen to steal Government cheques, which were then cashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr L. Cooper, a spokesman for the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> at yesterday’s meeting said none of the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> believed  Mr Cameron’s  claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cooper, of the Black Community Housing Service, asked how many <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> had the identification needed to get a Government cheque cashed across the counter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contents of the letter outlined the strong feeling of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in relation to  Mr Cameron’s  allegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to draw the public’s attention away from bigger issues such as Petersen directing the Queensland Registrar of Titles office not to transfer the title of land recently purchased by the Commonwealth Government for the Arukan blacks, the forthcoming review of both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islander Acts, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can ascertain,  Mr Cameron  had no evidence to support his wild claims that ‘a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had formed a co-operative to steal pension and social security cheques from letter boxes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allegation to which I refer, of course, is his claim that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had formed a co-operative to steal pension and social security cheques from letterboxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the Commissioner for Community Relations does view discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a serious matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dominant element of this so-called knowledge is contempt -an attitude that offers insult and builds a deep and boiling resentment, particularly among young, urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which is completely understandable and with which I sympathise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, basically speaking, we have taken away the great proportion of the things to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were dedicated and which held up their culture, their religion and everything associated with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To date, the school system has failed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> very badly by its inappropriateness and inadequacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee investigated in depth and over a long period the educational problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deviate to say that there are serious educational deficiencies in those parts of Australia where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have gone back to their homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need and seek consultation and where they need some sort of formal education for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have indicated that the greatest immediate need is for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of appropriate ability to attain placement at the highest policy making levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too many white man’s decisions and not enough <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ decisions have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to soliciting the advice of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the policy making level, it is vitally important also to ensure that the parents of Aboriginal school children are involved in their children ‘s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Van Leer program testifies to the importance of this, and the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders has remarked on this in its final report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the curriculum taught at schools is often biased against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in more ways than one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall one case that came to the attention of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Approximately one-quarter of all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders aged 15 years and over have never attended school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote again from the report of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great deal of common concern throughout the community by those who care about education, those who are concerned about the plight of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our society, and those who have a particular interest in Aboriginal education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the first question, particularly in relation to education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is: Education for what? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a very willing and sympathetic concern, particularly for young Aborigine people and, growing with that, we have an awareness that adult <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to receive education ought to be able to receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by and large, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not had much to go to, notably in the Northern Territory but also in the sparsely populated areas of Queensland and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can look at the skills or one can look at the way of life and I think I can say that there is a general consensus that an attempt is being made through the education system to make available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> those skills that are necessary for survival in the Australian society at large, if that is what they choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously one of the large problems of Aboriginal education in Australia has nothing to do with the education portfolio; it has to do with providing jobs in the areas in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> tend to live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Robertson  said, the most important questions we must ask are: What do the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the white Australian, if I may use that term although it is a little offensive, has a role to play because we do have some expertise, some skills and some experience which we ought to make available to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if they want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, the people on this Committee will play a critical role in advising those who are in power, those who have the means of directing funds, governments and so on in Australia on what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want from education, both in the short term and in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been interested in the composition of this Committee because I have had some contact with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are interested in furthering the Aboriginal cause in Australia, particularly in Queensland but in some other States as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that none of us would be so foolhardy as to say that we know what ought to be the nature of education for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we use our value judgments in our JudeoChristian culture to look into the very complex cultures of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we must have a fair reason for being wrong- a fair reason indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our duty in an educational sense is perhaps more profound for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than it is for others in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it ought to look towards freedom of choice in movement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> back towards their traditions, forward into our western culture or to a fairly continuous movement between the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether education in the Western sense should follow the movement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outwards, whether it should be undertaken in a bilingual way or whether teachers should be European or Aboriginal are matters which are part of the adventure of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Does the Minister recall comments she made in the urgency debate on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on 23 March 1977 where she stated that she would be prepared to send a departmental officer to those areas where there are particular difficulties with regards to registration for unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to recall that in 1 967 when all three political parties propounded with unanimous voice a proposal to break the nexus between this House and the other place, the people of Australia in nearly all States- I think in 5 States if not six- by a vote approximating 70 per cent renounced the overtures of the trinity, the 3 parties, and under persuasion of some 10 senators, again from 3 parties, they rejected the nexus but overwhelmingly accepted the proposal relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a threat over the heads of everybody in the Northern Territory that if the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly goes ahead with a particular ordinance people will be classified in little groups- whether they are traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to whether they are allowed to use modern-day transport to go hunting for bush tucker, whether they are able to use rifles, or whether they must be confined to the use of spears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When anything goes wrong the people who get the blame are not the consultants or the departmental officers; it is always the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Housing Commission has gone even further than that because it has removed paling fences from around some of the older homes that have been purchased and rented to Aboriginal people because it said the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will pull all the palings off and use them for firewood; but that is not true at all because many of those homes do not even have wood stoves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> apparently will be readily identifiable the Housing Commission has decided to paint all the houses the one colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Why should <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who rent Housing Commission homes- and the Commonwealth funds the Victorian Government to provide this sort of housing- be discriminated against in this way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the local bylaws and ordinances allow a front fence to be built quite obviously the kiddies could play at the front of the house without their mother’s fearing that the kiddies will run out on to the street into traffic; but apparently it is all right so long as the kiddy is black as he is allowed to run out onto the street and to be run over by a passing car because the housing association believes in this policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same sort of thing is happening in Queensland which has a black population of something like 60 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One was the circumstances of 42 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who, having applied for Aboriginal study grants, were temporarily placed upon Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme grants because all the funds allowed for the study grants had been consumed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems facing  Senator Colston  in interpreting the figures is that they are given in 2 categories- the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on study grants as at 30 June of a year, and the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on study grants as at 3 1 December of a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not true that this small amount, which is less than 7 per cent of the recommended allocation, will do very little to solve the problem of high unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the statement yesterday by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in which he urged top level businessmen to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a bid to reduce unemployment, indicate that this Government, under its federalism approach to governing, has now abdicated its responsibility to the Aboriginal people of this country and, as with everything else, is leaving it all to so-called private enterprise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe a serious study of the Minister’s statement yesterday will show the intention of the Government with regard to the assistance that it will give to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in devising work opportunities for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) What headway has been made in discussions with the Queensland Government on matters concerning that State’s refusal to allow lease land in that State to be sold to Aboriginal Land Councils and individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any refusal by the Queensland Government ‘to allow lease land in that State to be sold to Aboriginal Land Councils and individual members or groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be employed in this project and will they receive a share of profits as well as wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) Does the Minister recall comments made by the Minister for Social Security made during an urgency debate in the Senate on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on 23 March 1977, where she stated that she would be prepared to send a departmental officer to those areas where there are particular difficulties with regards to registration for unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-125">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, recently-arrived migrants and other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-134">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the  President  ofthe Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders,  Mr J.  McGuiness, has called for the removal of  Mr Giese  from his present position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-141">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Aboriginal Loans Commission which has the power to make loans to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the purpose, among other purposes, of enabling them to purchase homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do many Aboriginal communities in central Australia not support the present Government policy with regard to education, as was suggested by John Edwards in the article entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now have Land Rights- but no Schools ‘in the  National Times  dated 7 March 1977; if so, (a) what are the details, and (b) what action, if any, is the Minister taking to investigate the claims made in the newspaper article concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-81-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the second occasion in the space of 12 months, it is my privilege to rise and present to the Senate a far reaching and searching report on the important issues affecting my people- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I apologise for my inability to express in flowery langauge the mythology surrounding the belief of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that land is an extension of their soul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not capable of using the phraseology which  Senator Bonner  used but I do recognise that to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> land has a greater significance than its commercial value has to Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the case with the report of the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was also the case with the report on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the southwest of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter referred to in the dissenting report is the strong belief that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have control over seas adjoining Aboriginal land for a distance of 2 kilometres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, although there is a dissenting report signed by two members of the Committee saying that there is justification for granting a 2 kilometre zone to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the impression given is misleading because, if there had been full attendance at that Committee meeting, that would have been the majority decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that there have been occasions when  Senator Chaney  has considered the winning of an election in Western Australia more important than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, so I would not be too critical of those who did not attend meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that is noticeable is that when tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in their setting or are together, each one knows who has responsibility for each area of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> know who owns the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner also has the responsibility, under section 15 of the Act, to ascertain whether the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> making the application or any other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the traditional owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some novelty about , the Land Council which the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not fully understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Land Council can be excused at the present time for not having more contact with the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the field, it is more qualified than any other section, as it has trained field personnel, who could be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for the purpose of going out and explaining the operations of the Land Council and getting the opinion of the tribal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal Land Councils, which seem to have control over Aboriginal land under the Act, cannot do anything on Aboriginal land unless they have discussed it with the residents of the land and are fully convinced that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned realise what they are talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is not doing what it says it is doing for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the granting of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that this refers only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have a claim to unalienated Crown land and not private land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the part of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there was a request for a 2 -kilometre area of the sea right round Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the recommendations we put forward will provide a helpful guide to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in reaching a solution which, firstly, will guarantee to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the traditional access that they have had to the seas and which the Commonwealth Act requires should be preserved to them; secondly, will enable the protection of areas which are of special significance, be they sacred sites or areas close to significant Aboriginal communities; and at the same time will result in a preservation of what I would call the normal Australian recreational rights to use the sea for the total community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: In view of the fact that the Aboriginal Loans Commission, which is the body which lends money to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the purchase of homes, used its grant of $ 10m last year, why has its appropriation been reduced to $5m this year despite the numerous applications for loans which have been made to that Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the relationship of the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the white man has not been a happy one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that to make a general statement of the situation would be to overlook the different attitudes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves and the different districts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I undertake to look at that matter in regard to the owners of pastoral properties to see whether any other way of dealing with the matter can be achieved, bearing in mind the attitudes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to this benefit, the needs of the communities and also our own objective to try to provide employment wherever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it the intention of the Government in the future actively to increase funds for work projects rather than pay unemployment benefits or ‘sit down money’ as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> refer to it to enable the people to work within their communities on necessary projects rather than live on unemployment benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem that some of these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are condemned to living under sheets of tin and under the Swan River Bridge, as they did at Guildford for many months before the police and the Shire of Midland eventually moved them forcibly onto a block of land in Saunders Street from which they have now been evicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, taking into consideration the number of new schools constructed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Church mission schools taken over by government and the Northern Territory urban schools now considered as Aboriginal schools, is the Government giving urgent attention to increasing the number of Aboriginal teachers for these schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, of course, devoutly to be desired in all professions that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be encouraged to seek and obtain qualifications even under some pretty profound difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the 97 recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders referred to by  Senator Bonner  in a question without notice on 24 August 1977  (Hansard  page 442) will the Minister give details of actions taken by the Government on each of the recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Canberra Times  of today- Wednesday, 5 October- has reported on its front page under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Protest at Mine Start’ that the Ranger uranium mining project in the Northern Territory plans to have the construction of a dam, road works, et cetera, commenced shortly and before the wet season begins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the tragic distinction of experiencing the highest death rate, the worst health and housing and the lowest educational, occupational, economic, social and legal status of any section of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Day the Minister stated ‘On the administrative side of Aboriginal Affairs I am determined that the credibility of my department should be restored and raised ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned it is not always necessary in the eyes of a lot of people that the law be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has never referred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as black and while we had differences of opinion whilst he was Minister with the responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, I still have respect for his judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am afraid this will be very difficult to achieve when I see the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are used within this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the report in the Melbourne  Age  of 26 September 1977 which details the problems being experienced by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, including infringements of basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister assure the Senate that action will be taken to ensure that contravention of Federal laws by the Queensland Government does not continue and that discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ceases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971-1975 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971-1975 and associated regulations limit the rights and freedoms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland in comparison with those enjoyed by other Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals that have been introduced by the Government to provide employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in no way breach the matters that have been referred to by  Senator Cavanagh  in the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some time several Ministers of this Government have been in consultation with Aboriginal communities to enable work programs to be introduced by the communities and to give the opportunity for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to work in their own communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a voluntary system of employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live within those communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish to avail themselves of unemployment benefits, they may do so by seeking work outside of these communities, but if they wish to be part of the schemes that have been introduced at the initiative of Aboriginal communities they may do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we should accept that this is an opportunity to provide the dignity of work for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to provide a scheme that is to the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Senate that these programs were embarked upon after very considerable negotiation and a great deal of response from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the submission is similar to that lodged by Mount Isa Mines Ltd and in direct opposition to the case for land rights made out by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great concern will have to be shown for this problem of encouraging the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to participate in the program for their own good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before leaving the subject of the propagation of cassava I point out that it is a root plant that is now used pretty extensively by quite a few people, particularly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in the northern parts of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister undertake to indicate to the Premier and all Australians that the granting of land rights is not apartheid, but a long overdue recognition of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ intimate relationship and ownership of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have hoped that more money would have been allocated so that we could have done all those things that I am sure that we, as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, would like done on our behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to say in this chamber tonight that whilst I am very conscious of my responsibilities, which embrace all the people in Queensland and all the people in Australia, I believe that interwoven with those responsibilites is my love of race and my burning desire to do whatever I can to ease the lot of my Aboriginal fellows and to do whatever I possibly can to improve the conditions under which my fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I walked out after moving it and making my speech, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were in the chamber at the time asked, ‘Is he the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or the Minister for White Backlash?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the organisations that are working for the benefit of the indigenous people, for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders alike, to have the finance needed to carry out their programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you were Minister you could not even sit down and talk to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because you were so involved in other affairs and so scared of white backlash that you were not able to do the job properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can make available to people, whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or not, opportunities for better education and health facilities, but unless their children can come home to a decent home with an environment where they can sit down and do their homework, it is all to no avail;  so housing is  a very important factor for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber are supposed to be the champions of the underdog, the champions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, yet  Senator Cavanagh  can stand up in this chamber and call an Aborigine a hypocrite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  has dealt with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide royalties not only to the emerging State Government but also to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the tribal lands adjacent to the mining establishments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Labor Government that began spending large sums of money to improve the position of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During my term as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I found that there were many in our society who try to make a profit out of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They exploit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the money made available for Aboriginal affairs as much as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been deprived of some $27,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters which anyone who considers <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be concerned about and taking into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be concerned about taking political advantage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner said yesterday that while the Labor Government gave money to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>,  Mr Viner  is sitting down talking to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They hold an annual conference concerned with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on a national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the direction which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will take and consideration of their matters destroyed completely by a committee which the Minister has a say in appointing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this was the solution for buying the silence of an opponent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are as many con men in the Aboriginal community or amongst those who pretend to support <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as we will find in white communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are interested in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we must recognise and identify these people and we must expose them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not particularly tied to a royal commission; but, because of the continuing bad relationships between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and many sections of the police force, it is obvious that some inquiry has to be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen internal inquiries into the problems faced not only by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also by other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The were classified as local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and were arrested, allegedly for drinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we want to know about the 24 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> you have banned’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Police in Western Australia had acted in the most deliberate attempt to pervert justice after an incident involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Skull Creek, the Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister  (Mr Viner)  said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The police then altered the original charges from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fighting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fighting police, but both charges were found to be untrue, according to the royal commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By any standards of conduct towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or nonAborigines, this constitutes the most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of justice’,  Mr Viner  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article went on to say that of the 28 police officers at Laverton at the time of the incident only ten had had any previous dealings with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intercede there to say that this is totally inconsistent with the letter that he wrote to me this  year in which he washed his hands of any problems that were facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and police in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Viner said police ‘intentionally frustrated’ the commission investigation into the imprisonment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on fabricated charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was reported that until 2 1 December there was complete harmony between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Laverton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Inspector Hilton, on the evidence of Sergeant Holmwood, said to him: ‘You are too soft with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there had been complete co-operation and harmony between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the police, the attitude of the senior Inspector of the western desert district of Western Australia was that police had to take a definite attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that after those two <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been handcuffed and locked in the boot of a car on a very hot day it was left standing in the main street of the township while the police went off looking for a further arrest- with those two people suffocating in the boot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted to travel from point A to point B and were put in the luggage compartment until the space was filled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first aspect on which we must make up our minds is: What is the right attitude to be adopted between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we adopt the line followed by Sergeant Holmwood who mixes with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and has no trouble with them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must come down on the side of more lenient treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a call for an independent inquiry into relations between police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Federal Government policies have in our opinion directly contributed to the breakdown in the relations between our members and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assaults on our members of a serious nature by groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have increased and only in recent months in the Moree and Cowra areas members have had to engage in running battles with these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the police were seen to approach one or more of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we stood behind them muttering about how the chaplain would make a very good sermon next Sunday morning and I would make an excellent Press statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was solved in Tasmania by shooting and poisoning them, by annihilating them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today  Senator Bonner  spoke about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> building humpies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were nomadic people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The directors also had with them, very importantly,  Mr Eric  Wilmott from the National Aboriginal Education Committee, who gave them some indications of the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a migrant group and, of course, reflected upon the importance of a - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder what the reaction of this Parliament and this nation would be if the Soviet Union were to conduct an inquiry into the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia or Queenslanders at the present time in absentia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party opposes these proposals of the distribution commissioners relates to an event that occurred in the Kimberleys in the by-election for the Western Australian Legislative Council held earlier this year, when it was alleged that a large number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were deterred from exercising their voting rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that if the allegations made before the Court of Disputed Returns in Western Australia were correct and that, in fact, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were deterred from exercising their right to vote after they had enrolled, it is axiomatic that a number of Aboriginals also could have been deterred from exercising their entitlement to enrol for voting purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that if the large number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, based on the 1971 census figures, were encouraged to exercise their right to enrol there would be a substantial shift in the number of electors involved in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who have worked for a long time on these stations and who are on award wages, find in their work not only their salaries but also their homes and, I believe, their security and their dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is common knowledge that in those areas of Western Australia the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have left the stations and are not able to find employment in the towns very quickly lose their dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned about the possibilities of any scheme that related only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and I understand that concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suspect that the payout would be considerably less than that because some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are already employed on Aboriginalowned properties, which are subject to certain government subsidies or support schemes in any event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty arises when one extends the scheme to non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a test which would tend to pick up more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than whites, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to him that in view of his opposition to any form of racial discrimination, I hope he will use his good intentions with some of his colleagues in his State who trooped north during the last Western Australian election to confuse the minds of so many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the north of Western Australia over their rights to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, what does the Minister intend to do to ensure that there is continuing legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out to honourable senators that according to the 1971 census 22,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are Uving in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, as we all know, although <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are entitled to enrol it is not compulsory that they do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Opposition believes that a great proportion of the 15,000 Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who reside in the Kalgoorlie electorate would not have enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not a cent of it was spent although the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were crying out for it to be used for the purpose of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that it is the policy of the trachoma team to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wherever possible and that this policy has proved highly successful in treating many hundreds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> affected by trachoma and other eye diseases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A key feature of the Fraser Government’s policy for Aboriginal education has been to increase the emphasis on using <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in education and on advancing their status and education, both as teachers and teaching aides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to any such increase in competition, does the Minister expect fewer university places to be offered to special entry groups, such as nonmatriculants, adult matriculants and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canberra- The Queensland Premier  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  has successfully blocked the Federal Government’s trachoma program to eliminate blindness amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Premier said they had encouraged <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enrol for the State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are asking <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enrol on State rolls for the State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Long before I came to the Parliament I advocated that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should enrol on both State and Federal rolls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I encouraged them wherever I possibly could to involve themselves in all tiers of government and in all areas where I believed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could make a contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The program, sponsored by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists, has uncovered the world’s highest blindness rate among outback <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Less than a quarter of Queensland’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have so far been screened by the team ‘, he said. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the program is abandoned most of this fantastic effort will have been in vain and a final report on the eye health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be impossible. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘The eye health problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> here are so horrific that these men have been too busy working their - backsides- off to help save sight to have time to get into polities’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Press article the claim that they are political activists stems from the fact that they have encouraged <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have their names placed on the electoral roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is conscious of the work that is being done by Professor Hollows and his team which includes the two <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government claims the development of a national employment strategy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in both government and private employment as another plus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do not mind if the Government wants to claim credit for it as long as it does not repudiate its own policy and back out of the campaign just because the lone ranger Premier in one State decides that because he is frightened of a couple of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> associated with the team, the team should not be allowed to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suspension of the campaign for political reasons will prevent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with eye conditions from obtaining that treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that district have a big problem which goes totally unnoticed by the State Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and Fisheries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His ruling is that he will not allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> either as individuals or as groups to purchase properties under the Queensland leasehold system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such a decision is postponed until after the December election, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area, and in Queensland generally, will scatter far and wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the programme is suspended until after December 10 many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area will be travelling to visit relatives and friends over Christmas and those with eye complaints may never receive the treatment they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It could provide programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether on that track record we would have much for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Cavanagh  pointed out- I had intended making reference to this matter anyway but he has covered it adequately- on just about every page of the Minister s statement she talked about what the Government is doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But what has the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  done today to those two <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were interviewed on television tonight and who have been given the sack? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Electoral Act altered in Western Australia to deprive illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of a postal vote or seeking the assistance of a scrutineer at a polling booth to enable them to cast a vote for the candidate whose photo they point to on a how-to-vote card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least  Mr Court,  the West Australian Premier, will not be able to deprive illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the opportunity to vote in the Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government regards this project as vital for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps are being taken to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are better equipped to secure employment after leaving school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a policy which asks the whole of the government framework including, one hopes, State and local government, to give some preference and priority to the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the total potential work force of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia, which out of a total population of 150,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must be only 30,000 to 40,000, one can appreciate that if the three spheres of government apply themselves to this policy there will be no real problem as regards employment if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> choose employment rather than their traditional life style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the portfolio of Education there is a concentration now upon the revision of curricula to make the training and education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> more meaningful, whether they choose their traditional or the European style of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This revision is now taking place, and we are looking towards the appointment of careers officers or vocational guidance officers to bridge the gap between school and employment, which is a vital matter as far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether this has been a deliberate action by the Government to prevent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> getting land rights until the uranium leases are resolved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that as a result of failure to implement land rights, Tipperary Station has mustered up to 3,000 head of cattle from adjacent lands which belong to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the owners of Tipperary Station will not negotiate with the traditional owners regarding compensation until such time as legal action is taken by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reminded the Senate yesterday that in terms of recruiting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be trained as full teachers at Batchelor Teachers Training College and of recruiting teaching aides the Government is aiming to increase the numbers and to use both preservice and in-service training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government pledged that it would, among other things, assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘To become more self-sufficient and acquire the skills to manage their own affairs. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the college- a pilot scheme which is positively adding to the stature of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community, which is truly encouraging selfhelp and self-development among the Aboriginal community- is tottering on its feet, continuing only because of the compassion and concern of its staff and the keenness of its students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not the only group in the community subject to the administration of placebos rather than restorative medicine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and women will never be assured if the Government and other bodies continue to blinker themselves, continue to look at the problem from the wrong end of the telescope so that individuals disappear into the middle distance and injustices and anomalies are treated by talking rather than doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It affected the displacement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from stations in the drought stricken pastoral areas of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were only 300,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and there are 750,000 East Timorese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the turn of the century there were 300,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and we are now down to fewer than 70,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that kind of statement is not going to cause problems in itself when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being given their rights by a Federal government for the first time in the history of this country, I do not know what will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would no more get a share of the benefits than if the minerals in Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory are mined and some work is created for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and nonAborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the white man always comes out on top. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the only way that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may sometime, somewhere find it necessary to accept help from people other than those who have the opportunity at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the mining companies which are kicking up such a row about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having the right to determine whether uranium or other minerals should be mined on their properties, it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She took the example of Australian women and the example of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner  made the point with great passion and from the heart and from personal experience that despite what has been said and, indeed, despite legislation which has been passed in this chamber with respect to land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, those land rights have not yet been implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were intimidated by employees of the Commonwealth Electoral Office or Electoral Office staff allowed people to be intimidated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General later in his Speech referred to the Aboriginal population and to the Government’s intentions in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Community Health Service pursues a radical, racist and militant philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> currently are employed under the scheme and what is the average weekly wage of those employed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What brought that to my mind was  Senator Button’s  reference to the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may have recorded matters; they may have been verbal records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move now to that passage of the GovernorGeneral’s Speech in which he referred to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it intended that the caravan park at Ayr will provide employment for a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and then an on-going income for a smaller number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at that centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs taking to persuade the Queensland Government to reverse the decision not to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to lease this small area of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 might say that that situation has been aggravated by the activities of the Queensland Government yesterday in kicking the Presbyterian Church out of two missions and taking them over on behalf of big business without consultation with the church or with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the responsibilities for the primary needs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> come within the province of State Ministers, as do the needs of all members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate request the Federal Government to assume full legislative responsibilities for Aurukun and Mornington Island <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland for the purpose of implementing the Federal Government policies of self-management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who listened to that program and who have followed in recent times the development of events in Queensland as they relate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> believe that the time has arrived for us to have a parliamentary debate on these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like many honourable senators on both sides of the chamber, over a long period I have become increasingly concerned about the policies of the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Government on many issues, but particularly on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 the overwhelming majority of Australians, in far larger numbers than even the original majority in favour of the Australian Federation- I point out that this question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia and in Queensland in particular was an issue at the time of Federation- voted in the referendum to give the Federal Government responsibility for Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national Government of Australia has the responsibility to eliminate the Queensland State Act on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the power vested in this Act that enables the Minister of the Queensland Government to ride roughshod over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State and in the case of Aurukun and Mornington Island to take over the church missions without consultation with the Aboriginal people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation recognised the moral and legal rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their traditional lands, but what has the Government of Queensland done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Act must be eliminated if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland are to receive their just due- their lands, adequate welfare and improvements to health and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of all, they must be eliminated as an inhuman restraint on the self-identity, culture and society of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that the Australian Government would see fit now to take the action necessary to enforce moral and legal rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does seem to run counter to the more modern trends of administration of aboriginal affairs, in particular policies of self management, which are directed to putting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the first time in a position where they can manage their own affairs, make decisions for themselves rather than being managed by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bjelke-Petersen  wants full control over Aurukun in order to enable mining to proceed unfettered by the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are directly affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reality the Queensland Minister, who was at Mornington Island on 12 March and failed even to discuss the proposed takeover with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is attempting once again to cover up the more outrageous decisions of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has to be said that over the years a consensus attitude has grown up in Australia and in the Parliament to the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and our responsibilities therein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal adviser to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has said that we have reached the point of no return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the light of those sorts of conditions and in the light of all the theory that exists in Australia about our responsibilities to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that we believe that the Senate should, as a place of review and as a place where independence of thought is expressed from time to time, accept responsibility and put on record a request to the national Government to assume its rightful responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That agreement can come only with the assistance of those who have given counsel to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the whole of this century- it was 1902 when the Christian Church went to that area- and who have built up respect and leadership in the area for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we ought to look at the background of the two communities about which we are talking to see what the problems are and to see how they can be overcome by working together and seeing that self-management of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is the factor on which we place primary importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems, from those statements, that the Church has been given an indication that is presence is welcomed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> hope that it will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those two problems in Aboriginal communities certainly require our attention, our concern and our interest; but they are not reasons why the Uniting Church should not administer these communities if it is the wish of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that it should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that the Government intends to continue to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to reach self-determination in their development and have opportunities for themselves and their children which we would want to see them have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through grants of that kind we hope that in general we will be able to improve the status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to improve their access to the programs which we find desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the discussion which I had before Question Time today with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he said that he hoped that after discussions with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the two communities concerned he will be able to determine their wishes for the continuing development and administration of their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again stress that we believe that this is the way in which we will best be able to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in whatever their requirements might be in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons it is a matter of primary importance to the Federal Government, and I give my assurance to the Senate that the Federal Government is treating this as a matter of urgency- certainly as a matter of public importance- and we hope that the solution which is achieved to this problem will be of long and distinct benefit to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate request the Federal Government to assume full legislative responsibilities for Aurukun and Mornington Island <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland for the purpose of implementing the Federal Government policies of selfmanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government take steps to take over Aurukun and Mornington Island Missions before the Queensland Government does so on the pretext of improving services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also written this book in order to bring White Australia to some greater compassion through understanding and to enlighten it to its responsibilities in the areas of land and compensation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I accept that in this area the major Commonwealth responsibility for Aboriginal welfare and the maintenance of the main thrust of that policy, which is to have a system whereby <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given more and more chance to manage their own affairs, is something that we must pay heed to and be prepared to act to protect if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Government is now pursuing a course which throws additional responsibility on to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to determine which way they want to go is something of which I believe we should all be in favour and all anxious to support, at least until it has had an adequate period of trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy to decide in the abstract that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to have certain rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is widespread indignation amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> around Australia because of the actions that were taken without consultation with them in the last few days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Telegrams were received from  Mr Copely,  the Regional Manager of Aboriginals Hostels Ltd, Adelaide; from the Aboriginal and Islander Forum, Cairns, North Queensland; from  Mr Shephard,  Secretary of Camu, an organisation of Cardwell in North Queensland; from  Mr McAdam,  Director, Aboriginal Community Centre, Adelaide; from  Mr John  McGuinness,  President  of FCAATSI in Cairns; and from  Mrs E.

    <p>I seek leave to incorporate the telegrams in  Hansard  because I believe they convey the sentiments of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders all around this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they are statements of fact I will certainly consult with my colleagues to see what can be done to ensure that matters of health and welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protected so far as the Federal Government is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the basis of the trouble that the Queensland Government sees is the separatism that is being practised between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the other people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the honourable senator asked whether it was a fact that the basis of the trouble with the Queensland Government was the separatism practised between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the other people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate in the Senate yesterday expressed the view of the majority of honourable senators that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the two stations concerned should determine themselves the best way in which to administer and develop their communities in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising out of all the discussions that have been held and the views that have been expressed in the past day or two, I believe, there is strong support for the right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to express the way they wish to see their communities develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, there are many people in this country whose view is that there ought to be integration; there are others who talk of assimilation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view of the Government is that it wishes to see self-determination by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, with assistance from government and community bodies to see that their health, welfare and development are such as to make them equal citizens and make the Government proud of what they are able to accomplish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Prime Minister,  Mr Viner,  other members of the Government and members of the Senate are at this stage all working towards fulfilment of the hope that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the two communities concerned will, through the national discussion of their situation, develop further and so enhance their prospects in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before concluding my remarks I wish to mention my particular interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the latter part of the question, I recall that early in 1976, and during that year, I had discussions with  Mr Viner  and also  Mr Street  with regard to the payment of unemployment benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will check to see what information is available with regard to the payment of unemployment benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and whether the specific matters that have been raised can be answered by my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will check the matter that has been raised by  Senator Cavanagh  today and will provide him with whatever further information is available, but from time to time I have answered questions and taken action to ensure that officers have been made available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine their eligibility for unemployment benefits and other payments through the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Minister see a television programme which alleged that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are mentally ill are being incarcerated at the Alice Springs prison because of the lack of psychiatric facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament if the allegation is accurate; if so, what action does the Minister propose to take to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> needing psychiatric care will be given such care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> needing hospital treatment of this nature are being treated as prisoners at Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> needing hospital treatment of this nature being treated as prisoners at Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will seek guidance from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on the plans he has for future development of such schemes, but I do think it is fair to say that the experience that has been gained by conducting these programs has shown them to be of benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to provide, in remote communities a means of employment which otherwise would not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has occurred in the limited number of communities which I mentioned yesterday is that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have sought, as an alternative to the payment of individual unemployment benefits, an employment scheme which would give that community the equivalent of what the adult members of the community, the working population, would receive in the way of unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The community councils concerned would then arrange the employment and pay the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> according to the work done by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister whether she will cause an immediate inquiry to be instituted with a view to ensuring that the Aboriginal community land at Herberton is left intact for the use of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland legislation- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the regulations and by-laws made under themprovide that officials, as well as Aboriginal and Island Councils, manage the affairs of reserve communities and the officials have the overriding power and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, only 1 1 years after, we have to consider one of the most important aspects of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill arises solely out of the attitude of the Queensland Premier,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Uniting Church at Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not give me any pleasure whatsoever to come to the conclusion that the misuse of power in Queensland that we have seen in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is no more than a symptom of a malaise in government generally within that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not important to this man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not his love of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that hurls him headlong into battles with the Federal Government; it is because he wishes to retain and exercise power arrogantly across a wide range of social issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For several years now successive Federal governments of both political persuasions have run straight into a brick wall in relation to Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has failed even to consider the effects of the Queensland Act in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The power to remove people from their tribal areas was most clearly demonstrated by the case at Mapoon in 1963 when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were removed at gunpoint by police and exiled to Bamaga and Weipa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the policy of the Government on Aboriginal land rights in as much as we recognise that fundamental to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ sense of aboriginality is their affinity with one another and their affinity with the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want this Parliament, through this legislation, to enable the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to maintain thenown culture if they so wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised that in several areas of Australia the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ claims to these lands are undeniable and must be accepted in law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The permit system enables <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine who enters their house because they regard their land as their house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt about the type of action pursued by the Queensland Government, such as the ludicrous and disgusting Aurukun Associates Act which greedily undermines the rights of the Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to share in the decisionmaking in relation to rnining in that area or to receive just compensation for the mining in their tribal area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government feels that it has to rush the legislation through because we cannot trust the Queensland Premier, how can it say that only with the co-operation of the Queensland Government will the legislation be successful and will there be any benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders resident in settlements in that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to us that the Prime Minister has demonstrated to the Australian public and to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the insincerity of the position in which he says he holds the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘own elected body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is how we see the Bill and that is how <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it came to office  2%  years ago the Fraser Government has concluded a series of arrangements with the Queensland Premier which have had the effect of denying Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders the basic rights which are enjoyed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> resident in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must have control over who enters the reserves and the communities in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current Bill will provide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland with the powers of exclusion in relation to who enters their reserves, but it fails fundamentally- and this is one of our points of contention- in that it does not provide them with the power to exclude individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These fundamental points in this legislationthe failure to explicitly set aside land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; the abject failure to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders full rights to exclude from entering the community individuals and groups whom they may feel to be detrimental to the community; the failure of the by-laws to cover Europeans generally or adequately and the rather complicated procedure in relation to the enactment of by-laws -are similar to many of the more paternalistic overtones of the Queensland legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sad reflection on Australia that we have not accomplished before this the means by which to assume federal responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fight that must be fought in the days and months ahead to provide the means whereby <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders can have self-management in Queensland must be commenced forthwith with the strongest possible legislation we can enact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here copies of some documents, including a copy of that speech made by  Mr Porter,  and a copy of some correspondence and other documents which relate, firstly, to this matter of whether the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves wanted the State Government to take over their missions; secondly, whether the churches wanted the State Government to take over the missions; and, thirdly, just what it is that the State Government, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the churches have been saying to one another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not find it any coincidence that in the  Courier-Mail  of 8 December, the Reverend John Brown of Boemar, was quoted in a statement headed ‘No State Take-over of Aurukun- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years there has been a growing awareness on the part of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and of other Australians that it is important that we preserve as much of Aboriginal culture as we can at this point in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and it is important to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be grateful if you will spell out for us what the Government’s policy is on the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to return to live on their traditional lands currently held as reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, because certain accusations have been made in the Queensland State Parliament about the Uniting Church and about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aurukun and Mornington Island,  Hansard  ought to contain the facts relating to those allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other allegations relating to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Uniting Church which will be covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I have spent so much time on that issue is because it has been claimed by certain Queensland members of Parliament that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at those places will say to you what they believe you wish to hear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We spoke to the Community Councils, the groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> elected by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to run, in cooperation with the Uniting Church, the affairs of the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not want the State Department to take over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the Government has indicated it will allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on every mission in Queensland to indicate whether they want a Federal Government takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been acquainted with some concern on the part of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on government mission stations in Queensland about a Federal Government takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A pottery on one of the reserves which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were told would be taken away from them was built with Federal funds although it is on State crown land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will be incumbent on this Government and all future governments to make sure that they keep faith with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on those reserves where it is invited in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a confrontation between the governments the only people who stand to really lose are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> depend on us to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to appeal to all Queenslanders, whether they be in the State Parliament or outside, to proceed with goodwill, to put division and rivalry aside and to realise that if they are genuine in their attempt to help the Aboriginal people they will aggravate the situation by taking aggressive public stands on issues which- in the total context of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> problem- are really not issues of consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator mentioned the fact that extra money would have to be spent in areas to improve the health and education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things about the legislation that shocks me is the fact that the Government is not prepared to consult with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We deplore speed of Federal legislation passed in House and  Mr Viner’s  stubbornness in refusing amendments recommended by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will lose heart in Federal Government if legislation does not include land rights and abolition of the Queensland Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland Aboriginal and Island Commission is not voice of Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but a rubber stamp for the Queensland Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill in itself is a sell-out of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does it not want to hold this matter over, at the request of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who are not sitting on this side of the House and are not in a position to make the same request to the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turn the Federal Government announced that it would step in to protect the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, of course, were delighted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all remember  Mr Ellicott  ‘s promise made in late November 1975 when he said that land rights would be given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that their position would be much easier under a Liberal-Country Party Government than it was under the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A redrafting of the complementary legislation then took place but for all effective purposes the people of the Northern Territory still do not have the land rights to which they are entitled in spite of the muttering of the Premier of Queensland that 45 per cent of the land in the Northern Territory is owned by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government at the time explained that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not need these funds in any part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of Queensland- for all effective purposes the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs and the dictator of that Stateobjects strenuously to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> moving to their homelands because he believes that this will enable them to retain their tribal cultures and will effectively prevent his policy of assimilation from coming into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland legislation- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the regulations and by-laws made under them- provide that officials, as well as Aboriginal and Island councils, manage the affairs of reserve communities and the officials have the overriding power and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of what  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  says about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> never getting their land, there are a lot of other people in Queensland who believe that these people are entitled to the land and ought to have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original plan envisaged that in the event of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> refusing to co-operate a series of barrages would be established on the local river and, if it were necessary, because the miners did not get their way, the mineral explorers would flood out the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act had been planned, drafted and were ready for implementation many months before they were introduced, but  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  was not sure at that time whether the McMahon Government would be returned on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Act was passed I made approaches to the Queensland Trades and Labour Council suggesting that unless the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got a fair go, and unless mining was carried out with their consent and their general wishes, and in accordance with what they required in return, union labour ought not to be supplied to that mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Trades and Labour Council agreed and subsequently carried a resolution to the effect that it would not supply union labour until such time as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason or other the Premier of Queensland does not want to see the Island occupied by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three groups combined to sell out the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that election also the ballot papers were filled in on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has repudiated them in the same way that  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  repudiates <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“The church and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want mining, but on the same system and royalties as the Northern Territory,’ he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is this great obsession that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must never get their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That includes the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who are not allowed to march either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, the Premier was prepared to sacrifice the eyesight and health of hundreds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in order to get his way politically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the demands made by the Queensland Premier <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been refused the use of land at Archer River, Cardwell, Ayr and other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of one local authority which, in the old days, had the special grants for the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> held up for many months because an election was imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate today is debating a Bill for an Act to empower Aboriginals- I would prefer to use the word ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’- and Torres Strait Islanders who live on reserves in Queensland to manage and to control their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this particular case, now that this Bill is before the Parliament, it has ignored the fact that the 1967 referendum empowered the Commonwealth under section 5 1 (xxvi) to legislate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders in Queensland is one of quite development which is both harmonious and progressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a copy here of a Bill which is entitled ‘A Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971, each in certain particulars’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I was attempting to free the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves from the tyranny of the Queensland Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner  mentioned the bauxite deposits but in this respect the legislation achieves nothing and  Senator Bonner  is fooling himself if he thinks that this Bill is a victory for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the Uniting Church could be accused of giving the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the wrong education but it was caught in a political web. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal communities are defined as Aboriginal communities formed under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act of 1971 and Islander communities are defined under the Torres Strait Islanders Act of 1 97 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we are leaving the control of the missions in the hands of the Uniting Church, the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement can set up its own administration whether the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> take any notice of it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These settlements are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘ homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing I can find fault with is that he does not mean what he says and he never does a thing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are provisions in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 which, as other documentary evidence shows, are somewhat beneficial to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It referred to a gang of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were employed in a road laboring gang. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation, nine <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were employed last July at Yarrabah Aboriginal Reserve, south of Cairns, in a road labouring gang. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have just outlined represents the actual encouragement that this Government is giving to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, if these people were employed on roadmaking off the reserve, they would get, whether or not they were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the appropriate award wage, which they were not getting at Yarrabah. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting letter is that from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service (Qld) Ltd, which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that we have now put an end to the practice of reserve managers who proceed against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being on reserves without permits, but I am quite sure that they continue to exercise de facto control in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That was sent by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Tones Strait Islanders Legal Service (Qld) Ltd and it is signed by Peter White, the State Executive Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few years ago we seemed to think in our paternalism that we would be doing the right thing if we gave the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the right to choose to drink alcohol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose if one looks at the question from a human rights situation one realises that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are entitled to their rights but I think all sections of the community would realise that alcohol has been one of the destroyers of the Aboriginal race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard mention from the other side of the chamber that the courts some years ago decided that equal pay should be given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the risk of being misunderstood, I would say that giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> equal pay has been as detrimental as it has been beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a myth that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are natural stockmen, just as it is a myth to say that white men are natural stockmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we had a situation in which large families of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> camped on station properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there was no work and no tucker on the properties the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> started to drift into the fringe society that we find around many of our country towns today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could show honourable senators classic examples of housing that had been selected by the white man for the use of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but which was not used because it was not appropriate to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory would be horrified at this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a palm tree he collected the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> together and they all said yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine a reserve on which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> prescribe a particular level of conduct for drunken driving, to take one instance, or education, to take another, and that is frowned on by the State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should get back to a proper consultative council table with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and work out a proper system of government for their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> pass a by-law prohibiting the use of alcoholic liquor on their reserves they cannot enforce that law on the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from a report of a Senate Select Committee entitled The Environmental Conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the Preservation of Their Scared Sites ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was from a House of Commons select committee report on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1837 and, so far as I can see, nothing has changed in the time from 1 837 to 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet people still talk about running things for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and how they therefore are going to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact in Brisbane the previous night, the then Federal Liberal Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Snedden,  said that he believed that the State Government had shown a great deal of concern for Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) to ensure that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will attain the same manner of living as other Australians and live as members of a single Australian community - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any special measures taken for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or partAborigines are regarded as temporary measures, not based on race, but intended to meet the need for special care and assistance to protect them from any ill-effects of sudden change and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favourable to their social, economic and political advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in Bill Commonwealth is denying pledged Liberal policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and promulgating pledged Australian Labor Party policies in lieu. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has he employed there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs table in the Parliament for the information of honourable senators the letter sent from a  Mr Jess  in Melbourne to the Treasurer on the matter of insurance of properties of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a copy of which was made available to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Senator Wright,  I do not claim to be an expert on either the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the constitutional problems of this country, but there are various aspects of the legislation and the manner in which it has been handled and brought to this Parliament which disturb me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Presbyterian Church before it became pan of the Uniting Church had agreed to the policy of self-determination for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to get away from the previous paternalism and to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to sort out and develop their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act of 1 97 1 of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think those findings of the ombudsman are of some assistance to us in at least determining the general attitude of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the Church which has been referred to in rather different ways by different speakers in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no State does the Commonwealth provide the executive means of delivering what are regarded as the necessary services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every State, but Queensland, to a great extent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> regulate their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the purpose of the present move is no more than to protect that concept of selfmanagement, that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be allowed to make decisions for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have in Australia is a system of choice, a system under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are for the first time being given property rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who say that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being given special privileges regarding this land ought to note that we are trying to protect a special sort of relationship with land which carries with it also some severe disadvantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the special title that we have with land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, they are restricted in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are called the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Regulations of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if it is true, as has been alleged in this place, that she was removed from that committee because she had expressed attitudes which were not favourable to the State Government, it is a reflection of an attitude we must put behind us, the attitude that if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are saying things which we do not like to hear we will shut our ears and try to keep the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> quiet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that all members of the Opposition have shown their sincerity and their interest in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right at the outset I say to those members of the Opposition and of the Government parties who have questioned the propriety of proceeding at this stage that we regard the passing of this legislation as an act of faith between the Government and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  was strongly urged by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in both communities to see that legislation to protect their position was passed this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who heard  Senator Bonner’s  speech yesterday would be aware of his intense feeling of urgency about the passage of the Bill and his feeling of satisfaction that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland will now have legislation which will enable them to take that further step in the management of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think his personal experience of some of these matters gave us an insight into what the passage of this legislation will mean to all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal Community’ means a community for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> established, or deemed to have been established, under or by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal Reserve’ means any land that is a reserve for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out the definition of’Aboriginal Community’, insert the following definition: ‘Aboriginal Community’ means a community of persons that, on 3 1 March 1978, was a community for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out the definition of ‘Aboriginal Reserve’, insert the following definition: ‘Aboriginal Reserve’ means any land that, on 3 1 March 1978, was a reserve for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has stated that his legal advisers are working on it with a view to working out a counter-offensive to ensure that his philosophy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had a different situation in other States and the States were co-operating with the Federal Government in pursuance of the Federal Government’s legal and moral obligations towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we would not be so concerned, but we have on the public record that the challenge is under way and the fight is on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what we say in respect of these first four amendments is that the integrity of the Parliament is at issue and the amendments ought to be given some mature consideration in view of what I hope is accepted by the Government as our genuine belief that the amendments will assist in providing the legislation with the safeguards which were mentioned in the second reading speech and the preamble to the Bill to preserve the Federal Government’s obligations to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal community’ means a community for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> established, or deemed to have been established, under or by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal Reserve’ means any land that is a reserve for the purpose of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act states:  the  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act  1971 of Queensland or that Act as amended and in force at any relevant time - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it can be amended at a relevant time-   if that Act ceases to be in force and another Act is substituted for that Act- the substituted Act or that Act as amended and in force at any relevant time, and includes- any regulations and other instruments (including by-laws) as in force at any relevant time under or by virtue of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971 or that Act as amended and in force at any relevant time, or under or by virtue of the substituted Act or that Act as amended and in force at any relevant time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That definition applies to the Aboriginal communities and reserves- it also applies to the Torres Strait Island communities and reservesunder the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act at any relevant time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may think that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act is good or bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Act was prepared by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we think it is good or bad makes little difference if it is a law that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not only prepared by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, it was also approved by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law is updated every six months in consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Premier himself promised the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they could have the Act altered, amended or even abolished if they so wished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this very minute the Act is undergoing a complete updating in full consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be understood that whether we think the Act is good or bad, it is an Act made by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and we should respect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Council means the Council established under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision would not, if it were made mandatory, remove the requirement that the Minister must be satisfied in that situation that a substantial majority of the adult <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> were in favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the purpose of these clauses to give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Islanders control of their own affairs- the day to day matters, the routine matters, the administrative matters and the matters affecting the whole gamut of local affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the point stressed is whether the reserve is where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live or whether it is the settlement as defined under the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to see whether we can provide the services in a way that does not affect the rights of the councils or the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can complain if the service is beneficial to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but as providers of a service do not have to ask a council ‘s approval some services that could be to the detriment of the community could come in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much to the concern of  Senator Wood,  who would have a fit if he knew, even the Communist Party could go in and offer to organise the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 9 (2) is intended to indicate that State departments and other authorities are expected to continue to provide services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at these communities that they provide to other citizens in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the amendment proposed by the Opposition would be to remove the requirement for ministerial approval of bylaws and to remove the restriction that by-laws apply only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister must approve by-laws, and the application of by-laws to non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I am advised, could raise constitutional doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Bill reads, I suggest that a vacuum is created by clause 14, which by its very force says that the State by-laws in force under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act do not apply to a reserve to which this Act applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are at a loss to understand why the Government should persist with the view that the bylaws which operate for all people who are resident on the reserves and all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders who visit the reserves should not apply to someone of another culture who comes onto the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier when speaking on this clause to the constitutional doubt that would be created about a Bill of this kind if it were to provide for people other than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Bill which deals with the selfmanagement of these communities and whilst no one would argue that there will be nonAborigines living in or close to the communities there are other ways in which the Opposition’s requirements could be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is not in force under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act or Torres Strait Islanders Act in respect of a person a permit authorising the person to reside on, or visit, a Reserve to which this Act applies, being a person who is not otherwise entitled to reside on, or visit, the Reserve; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person in respect of whom there is in force an authority under sub-section (3) to reside on, or visit, a pan of a Reserve shall not be prevented from entering and residing on, or visiting, as the case may be, and shall not be ejected from, that pan of the Reserve, by reason that a permit authorising him to reside on, or visit, the Reserve is not in force in respect of him under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act or the Torres Strait Islanders Act, and it shall not, for that reason, be unlawful for the person to be on that pan of the Reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the Bill is badly drafted for once again it appears to rely entirely on the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and the Queensland Torres Strait Islanders Act to establish the principle for the issue of permits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not extending to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> what is not already the legal and established right of other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amendments are designed to strengthen the relative provisions of the Bill relating to the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was referring to the title of land which should go to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>-  which should be granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of a number of submissions to the contrary effect from pastoral and other interests in the Northern Territory, I regard any form of leasehold title as inadequate to satisfy either the announced intentions of the Government or the expectation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘ as a satisfactory or proper solution to their aspirations ‘ in the case of reserve lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these sub-clauses stand at the moment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may be granted the use of tribal areas by the Commonwealth; they do not provide for ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this is neither the time nor the place to argue the question of ownership, but I have just been handed petitions from 594 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, starting with the Woodward Commission and going right through to the present day, there has been an appreciation by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the need for land rights to be recognised as an essential right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this Bill stands at the moment, there is no provision for the transfer of titles to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will certainly be a disappointing response to the general demands by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in recent years and to the acceptance of the principle which has been applied in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments I have moved are designed to provide ownership of lands for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whilst retaining the options open to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government support the abolition of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act (Queensland) 1971 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act (Queensland) 1971 and take such action as they may deem necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Queensland Discriminatory Laws Act 1975 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 be enforced in so far as they relate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government support the abolition of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act (Queensland ) 1 97 1 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act (Queensland) 1971 and take such action as they may deem necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Queensland Discriminatory Laws Act 1975 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 be enforced in so far as they relate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike earlier surveys, the past two issues include no breakdown of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in receipt of the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not able to comment on the options that are presently being examined by the Commonwealth  Government,  but I am able to assure the honourable senator that the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as outlined in the Senate last Friday will be foremost in the mind of the Commonwealth Government as it examines the options and as it discusses these matters with the Queensland Government tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first committee of which I was a member was the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, and the next was the Senate Standing Committee on the Social Environment, which looked into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and into the protection of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do so without equivocation because, as was indicated in the debate at the second reading stage and in the Committee of the Whole on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities SelfManagement) Bill last week, we feel that there are sufficient anomalies and ambiguities to warrant further consideration of the perspectives and the strategy that the Commonwealth Government has set itself in dealing with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be recognised that, in this power conflict between the rights of the Queensland Premier to determine the lifestyle of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland and the determination of this Government and this Parliament to free them from that influence and to give them the rights of self-determination and self-management, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have become the meat in the sandwich. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a position now in which Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on two missions are hesitant about their rights and are unable to evaluate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have had much evidence of the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland have been persecuted and are still being persecuted by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paternalism still operates to the detriment of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have restricted democratic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate has to accept the fact that we failed the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Friday by passing that legislation and by not giving more consideration to the amendments that were moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the militants, the churches, the Australian Labor Party- to use some of  Mr BjelkePetersen’s  words- and now the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has sufficient support to show again that within this Parliament there is a determination to pick up the tab and to accept our responsibilities in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, particularly in the immediate sense, those of Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee ought to take a close look at a very wide range of Queensland legislation to ascertain just how many pieces of legislation could possibly affect the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that we are arguing about what sort of Crown land the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living on, be it Aboriginal reserves or national parks, because our first priority and our first concern ought to be for the people living on the land, whichever Minister happens to be claiming responsibility for them at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hate to see a situation in which these sorts of dodges and feints could be used over and over again by a State government hostile to this legislation and hostile to the Federal Government’s policy in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a joint statement which was issued by the Prime Minister and the Queensland Premier last night one of the matters that was stated was that leases would be arranged for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the two areas concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Attorney-General by reminding him that the agreement reached between the Queensland Government and the Australian Government now gives to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Mornington Island and Aurukun less control over their communities and lands than they had prior to the original confrontation between the two Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether it will be possible for the Australian Government to fund a case on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their title to land rights in Queensland to the International Court of Justice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an article in today’s  Courier-Mail  which reports  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  as having said that the Uniting Church in Australia would remain to give pastoral care to Aurukun and Mornington Island <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but it was not expected to have administative control as at present? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people regard that agreement as a sell-out of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland, and I must associate myself with those sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me, speaking on behalf of my colleagues, that  Mr Viner  and  Mr Nixon  have broken their word to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that the assurances that were given to me by the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this place,  Senator Guilfoyle,  in the debate that took place several weeks ago, have now been put aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cast a pall of gloom over all those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in communities in Queensland who felt that they had an advocate in the Senate, who felt that they had an advocate in  Senator Bonner  and his colleagues and who felt that they had an advocate in the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can come to the conclusion only that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland have been betrayed as a result of this agreement which can only be described as infamous and denying justice at the very point in time when we felt that the principles of self-management were going to be applied, in the first instance to Mornington Island and Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought that, despite our criticisms, the passage of the Bill last Friday would have established beyond all reasonable doubt the very important principles of self-management for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the agreement seriously lets down the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland and has placed this Parliament in a very invidious position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has created a situation which cannot be tolerated by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1975 policy statement of the coalition parties indicated that the parties recognise “the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory” and included a commitment “to make lands available, either by grant or through the provision of funds, to tribal Aboriginals living on or near their traditional areas which are not on reserves and to detribalised Aboriginals in rural or urban areas”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal Act provides for the closing of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund which was established under Section 21 of the Northern Territory Administration Act and for it to be replaced by an Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account to be established under Section 63 of the Land Rights Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a pastoral lease is held by or on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a traditional land claim may be lodged with the Aboriginal Land Commissioner for land included in the pastoral lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that 40 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were recently expelled by the Yarra Bay Sailing Club in Sydney and that the expulsions were carried out because some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had taken up a petition protesting about an alleged assault on an Aborigine by an officer of the club? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator is claiming that there has been racial discrimination against the 40 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned, I am sure that the Racial Discrimination Act would provide some basis for reporting that incident to the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that a handful of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were holding up the progress of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has decided to proceed with legislation to free Aboriginals on Queensland reserves from the provisions of the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Acts which give State officials overriding powers over the management of communities on Aboriginal and Islander reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister, when referring to the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to read only three or four of those paragraphs because I think they also ought to go into the record on this historic occasion when the Government is repudiating the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that you would consider it wrong if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to lose their land so that an American company can make money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Bjelke-Petersen has been planning to replace the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and Torres Strait Islanders’ Acts with this legislation for twelve months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Management Committee of the Victorian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League sent me the following telegram: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League questions the ability and sincerity of the Federal Government in coming to a satisfactory agreement with the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities on the question of the land rights and self management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke for a large group of people and indicated that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted land rights and nothing less than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation will take away a lot of the rights which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rather dubiously hold now under the present legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But why should we expect the powers which the Queensland Government will retain under the proposed legislation to be exercised any less discriminatorily than the powers it has under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act are exercised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that term is applicable is that through that legislation the State Government, in collaboration with the Federal Government, is taking away land from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these two communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the Federal Government is attempting to take away the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those communities is quite contrary to the whole movement being made by the Federal Government to ensure that the right of self-determination of those two communities is assured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Keeffe  said that there are present in the Senate chamber today the  chairman  of the Aurukun Council and other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are supporting him in a delegation to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then come to the month of April when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs went to Mornington Island, and the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities) Self-Management Bill was introduced on 5 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to assure the people who have been engaged in discussions on this matter, whether they be members of the Church which has given support to the communities, members of the communities concerned or Aboriginal leaders, that there is very great support for them in the Government with regard to their objectives and their wishes to determine their own future and to accept the responsibilities of running their communities in a way that will be of benefit to all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are living in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we were to work together instead of trying to be divisive on the matter we would achieve more in the mutual interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia and of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A confrontation can work only to the detriment of all those who are seeking one common end; that is, the opportunity for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to live in these communities in the way in which they determine and for the support of government, the Church and other groups which want to work for their benefit to be maximised to the greatest degree possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government intervened originally because it had the strong belief that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not want to be taken over by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement provided for security of tenure in a long term lease, guaranteeing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> traditional land rights and securing their right to the use and occupation of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the negotiations that were part of the chronology of events that I listed show that the consultation between  Mr Viner  and the Church and the Aboriginal communities is one that allowed us on 11 April to believe that this agreement was in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and would be acceptable to all those who have been involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth Government is not satisfied with the terms of both the local government legislation and the leases, it will exercise its constitutional power to acquire land in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we are working towards the advancement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and we are seeking to help them to determine the way in which they will live in the future, co-operation in achieving those ends would be the better way of dealing with the matter, rather than to talk at this stage, and on this day, of the failure of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that adds to the confusion in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as to the intention of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask all those who are dealing with this matter on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the leaders of the communities to accept the commitment that has been given time and time again by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, by the Prime Minister and by other members of the Government, that if the legislation which is introduced and the terms of the leases which are to be offered are not acceptable to the community and are not in accordance with the agreement that was made on 11 April the Commonwealth Government will then consider the position and deal with the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two months in which we can change the nature of the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will live in Queensland in the future seems to me to be a very short period of time, given the energy expended by the Minister himself and by others working for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to pursue this matter to an ultimate conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the two months from 10 March to 10 May have been two months in which much community attitude has been developed which is supportive of the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of understanding of the needs and wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all of that process has been to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was touched by the appeal of the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  for co-operation to try to better the position of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition moved an amendment to clause 3 of the Bill, definitions, in which ‘Aboriginal Community’ is defined as meaning a community for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> established, or deemed to have been established, under or by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal Community’ means a community of persons that, on 3 1 March 1 978, was a community for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Commonwealth has power to make particular rules for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just how do these extraordinary powers affect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that people ought to be aware of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland have, over a long period, had a continuing input into Queensland Acts concerning Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Collard  ‘s statement on the years of litigation that might result from this Government using the powers it has to acquire this land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sounds to me very much like blackmail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this session, the Parliament has spent a considerable amount of time on discussions about the responsibilities of the Federal Government as they relate to land rights and the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have adopted something like a common stand in many respects, even though one sometimes is appalled at the degree to which some Government senators seek to impute improper motives and make highly critical extremist statements relating to the attitude of the Australian Labor Party in respect of the plight that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> find themselves in some 220 years since white civilisation came to this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be said that with the passage of time, during the last decade or so, the question of Aboriginal land rights has become a very important issue in the thinking and the consciousness of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, one finds it difficult to appreciate the reluctance of those people- more often than not they are found on the conservative side of the politicswho still resist the recognition that the Australian community and the parliaments generally owe to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the Senate will regard the amendments as genuine attempts to realise the objectives of those people who support the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to land rights, to realise the objectives which the Government set itself in the original legislation and to realise the objectives of the Party that I represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To an extent there has been a great deal of shadow sparring and we have not as yet reached the point at which we can say to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that we have fulfilled this important demand that they have made upon the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is prepared to support this piece of legislation because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary that some of the machinery measures in the amending Bill which the Senate is now discussing should be passed to enable the realisation of the objectives of the Government, the objectives of the Opposition and the objectives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will enable- I am sure this is why the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are anxious to see the legislation considered- the early establishment of land trusts to hold title to the land described in Schedule 1 of the principal Act, which includes all of the major Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, it is necessary that they be passed because there is a need to realise the objectives of both the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to pay some tribute to the Government for the alacrity with which it has recognised the deficiency in the original legislation and to commend it for the progress that it has taken on this matter to see that land rights are given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when one looks at the definitions in other Acts dealing with land rights and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whether it be the Queensland Act or our own Acts, one finds that in the minds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, land represents premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as whites put a fence around their piece of land and doors and locks on their houses and that is regarded as their property, we have to see that property in the minds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> means the land upon which they have resided and which they have used generation by generation, century by century and era by era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw ourselves as do-gooders, people who could sit in judgment and decide what was good for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in a period where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want selfdetermination, self-management and land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on to say that a further aspect of the Government’s policy in relation to Aboriginal land rights is to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘as owners of their land, to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to me extent that they choose, to participate in and influence the course of development of and on their traditional land, and to take advantage of the full range of opportunities which development may open up to them ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition fully share the view expressed in that statement but we take issue with  Senator Collard  who talked about assimilation as against the very important distinction that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have and require the right to make the decision of whether they want to be assimilated into a white civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as owners of their land, will be allowed ‘to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to the extent that they choose’, only to the extent that they allow their land to be used for such purposes and under such conditions as are set out in this amending legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill removes the power of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decline to make an agreement with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife for the use of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it wants the land for a park, for mining, for a town or for some other public purpose, when that point is reached white priority takes over from the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to title as expressed in the land rights concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Opposition sees every reason why the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have a priority over the needs of white civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not to be given prior dominion over the land and its natural assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be put in a secondary position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights which in the 1976 legislation rested with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may now be given to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and I would feel much asssured if the Minister for once would have discussions with the land council first and with the mining interests last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intimidatory and acts in a way that will prevent the free flow of information which is essential if we are to realise the objective of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly we are told that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to be granted land rights over certain areas, but then they must lease them to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we are told that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to have full access to information relating to uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region but that they can use the information only in such ways as are laid down in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secrecy provision prevents the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from disclosing material to the public, I draw to the attention of honourable senators opposite the fact and that this provision was neglected in the otherwise detailed second reading speech of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions protect the power of corporate secrecy and make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> impotent to challenge a company if it considers that disclosing its technical information might tend to incriminate it in regard to the protection of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard, it is apparent that in certain aspects of the amending legislation the Government is saying that the promotion of the processing, mining and exporting of uranium should take precedence over justice, land rights and the very principles of self-determination for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it came to the conflict, the Government put other interests before the attainment of the principles in the field of Aboriginal affairs and before the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government and to the Senate that when there is a conflict over these issues the paramount responsibility is to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my purpose to argue, therefore, that the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should take precedence over any supposed urgency of promoting a package of uranium Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party would argue that our primary responsibility rests with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would argue that the sacrificing of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which could come about as a result of this amending legislation puts their rights at the altar of uranium mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding those areas of criticism, because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see the Bill as a step forward in overcoming some of the defects in the earlier legislation, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill but will be moving three amendments at the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Fox recommended that the land should go to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> subject to a lease to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That recommendation is not one which the Government dreamed up as a restriction on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a restriction which in fact was put forward by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 204 of that report it is pointed out by the Fox inquiry that it regarded the wishes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for land rights in the area as of prime importance in any consideration of the establishment of a national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it was a recommendation which came from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves that the procedure we are following now should be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This move has been subject to arrangements which have as their genesis the suggestions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter in  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s comments which concerned me was his claim that in some way the Government was fostering a closed government and the restriction under this legislation of access by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the legislation, together with the other Bills with which we will be dealing shortly, provides very extensive powers to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned, not only in relation to access to information but also in relation to the enforcement of standards which are imposed upon mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the information to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given access is for the purpose of enforcing standards; it is not for the purpose of disclosing it to the commercial rivals of the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not suggest that we should alter that legislation in the way in which we are altering it now but that it should be altered in a way which would substantially diminish the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter has been that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have provided as little fetter to non-Aboriginal activity as have kangaroos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the Minister’s affirmation that people dealing with areas which are subject to Aboriginal rights now have to accept that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do have rights in these matters and that they have to be accommodated accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again that is an important statement because it is implicit in that statement that at times <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will make choices which will not suit other people; but they will be choices which they make in their own freedom to make them, to follow their own lifestyles and to live their own lives on their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we did, however, was to give the Aboriginal people, the owners, extensive rights to the surface which meant that persons seeking the minerals could take them subject to the greater right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to surface use and to surface enjoyment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is alleged that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being given a special right which is not possessed by any other section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Mining Industry Council should bear that in mind when it puts out such pamphlets, distributes them to members of Parliament and makes statements suggesting that there is something peculiar about the rights which are being granted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see a very clear parallel between the protection of farmers in Western Australia and the protection which is being given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is sufficient protection for the nation, for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for the miners or for anybody else in these at large arbitral provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Bill and I await with interest the Committee stage where I think it will be demonstrated that the fear expressed by  Senator Gietzelt  that this Bill reduces the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rather than enhancing and protecting them is in fact groundless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we ought to know that the Australian Mining Industry Council has conducted a fairly vicious campaign over a long period of time against the granting of land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, or, for that matter, anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of land-ownership of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is different from that held by Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I reiterate the point which has been made by  Senator Bonner  already that there is a clear indication that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fully understand the situation regarding land rights, and they are well aware- if I can use that phrase- of what they believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, as I read it, removes that right, lt removes the power of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decline agreement with the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>were moved by a desire to protect the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and theirs was a perfectly legitimate argument to put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pacifists or persons who believe that there is a special duty to the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when a work of this kind is contemplated might strongly advocate, at an early stage, the entire prevention of such a project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will do nothing to protect the health and wellbeing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> any more than it will safeguard their land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also inquire into the statement of  Mr Porter,  the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs, on the latest  Monday Conference  program that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working on reserves were being paid $10 per week less than the award wage under arrangements with the Federal Government to employ such workers under the National Employment and Training scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I and my colleagues on this side of the chamber today will go into fairly in depth detail to prove why this Government must take a more positive action in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country and why, as a matter of urgency, it must take a more positive attitude in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live at Mornington Island and Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  made a statement shortly after the agreement with the Queensland Government saying that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on both settlements had agreed to a trial period of six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only somebody who knows nothing at all about Aboriginals would make such a stupid and ridiculous statement as that because as anybody knows- and  Senator Bonner  would know- this is a sign of war so far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At another point in the discussion the Minister said that more than half of the 70,000 Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland were living in the mainstream of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She tried to imply that one billion dollars had been spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland over the past few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These sorts of innuendoes do the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> no good at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister paid little attention to the culture which is so revered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Porter wants to do that with the bones of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ ancestors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants to destroy the places of worship of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one point he implied that it was disastrous that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were trying to retain their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be incorporated- assimilated is the word he is fond of using- into the general community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Porter made another untruthful statement when he said that hundreds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in the Torres Strait region own their own homes and that thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders own their own homes or are purchasing their own homes because they are unable to raise the type of deposit which is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Queensland Government deceitfully brought down two members of the Aurukun community and some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living at Weipa and tried to make it look like they spoke for the Aurukun people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program was one which many people throughout Australia would have found interesting, concerning as it did a subject of current political importance and of vital importance, of course, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National policy statement of the Liberal and National Country Parties of November 1975 made it clear that they recognised that fundamental to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ sense of Aboriginality of affinity with one another- was their affinity with the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties recognise the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also make land available, either by grant or through the provision of funds, to tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on or near their traditional areas which arc not on reserves and to detribalised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in rural or urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have expressed surprise that a Liberal-Country Party government should have made the decision to grant land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all noted that this Bill was a major step forward for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territorynot only for the present generation but also for future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that that was an important debate because it was the first time that legislation which gave inalienable rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on their traditional land had been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be said that, although there has been much comment from the present Opposition about this matter, it did not achieve legislation which gave land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during its term of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities at present, we ought to say that despite the fact that much rhetoric may have been heard from the Opposition about Queensland, it did not have the courage or the capacity to use its powers to do anything about rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly land rights, in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has achieved by legislation which was passed through the Senate and the House of Representatives land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to talk about the intention of some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to seek further action by the Commonwealth Government perhaps we need to look at South Australia where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have indicated to the Commonwealth Government that they are not satisfied with the action by the State Government on land rights and where certain actions have been taken in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the position in South Australia we can place on record that Commonwealth and State Ministers, because more than one State was involved, examined the request of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for further land rights at meetings of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council and appointed joint working parties to advise on possible collaboration that can be achieved among State governments and between State governments and the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to us that what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are seeking now in the States is legislation that gives them rights similar to what has been achieved for them in the Northern Territory by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the agreement the management of the two reserves will not be taken over by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act, as the Queensland Government had formerly proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this agreement the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will obtain secure tenure of the former reserves under a long term lease guaranteeing their traditional rights and securing their right to the use and occupation of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the land was a reserve- this was the former positionthe <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had few legal rights and the reserves, as was demonstrated, were liable to be revoked at any time by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new agreement and under the new Queensland legislation the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be leaseholders and will have property rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communities will be able to retain their relationship with the Uniting Church although the church will no longer manage the reserves under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the agreement, if the Commonwealth is not satisfied with the terms of both the local government legislation and the leases it will exercise its constitutional power to acquire land in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it has been agreed by everybody that there ought to be a testing period to see whether this legislation will work and will achieve for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the degree of self-management which will enable them to determine their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government will provide financial support to see that this is able to be done; it will assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in welfare matters and in the enterprises which they choose to conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government reiterates its promise to the Aboriginal people that if the way this proposal develops and the way in which the legislation operates do not achieve what we believe is consistent with our policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we will take the ultimate step to acquire the land in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be said in a debate on this matter of public importance, namely, that there is a need for a clear declaration of Government policy on the granting to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders inalienable title to their traditional lands, that there has been a clear statement of Government policy which, in the case of our own territories, has already been enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that these two communities are ready for self-management and, as I said in this place when we dealt with the legislation, we would consider acquisition of the land if this were the only way in which our own policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could be achieved consistent with our responsibilities under the powers that were given to the Commonwealth by the Australian people at referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the position with regard to the policy of the Government on land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to state that policy in any other way overlooks completely not only the policy which has been clearly stated but also the actions which have been taken by the Government since it was elected in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should be ashamed of the position which it has taken in this regard, a position which has been clearly referred to not only by the Opposition but also by members of the Government parties, particularly  Senator Bonner  who has been a most vocal and sincere spokesman for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having purchased that land, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can then make application to the Land Commissioner for it to become Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, this practice will continue and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will accumulate more and more land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last people to receive appropriations from the Government must be the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes in giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> title to their traditional land but it is not prepared to fight to the extent necessary in some areas to achieve this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That land rights Bill was more generous to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory than the one introduced by the Government and for which it claims credit for giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government had arranged with every State but Queensland to establish an Aboriginal Lands Trust, an organisation to be controlled by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves which would hold land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I met the  deputy  director of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement who agreed with the Labor Government’s submission for the Commonwealth Government to take over planning policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen  stated that this question will never be settled until the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get control of their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having set a precedent in the Northern Territory the Government will never satisfy tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> until they receive the same justice as was given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not presume that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Aurukun and Mornington Island have accepted the Queensland Government’s legislation, even as amended to the satisfaction of the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to what has gone on in Queensland, which government and which people fought for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these two communities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Securing land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory is a significant expression of this objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators first of all of parts of the Bonner report- the report of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders presented to the Senate in 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It examined the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Fraser Government which fought for the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As some honourable senators will know, that is a resolution concerning the Aboriginal people and it was passed by the House of Commons Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> (British Settlements) in 1 837. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Critical observers in looking at the GovernorGeneral’s Speech on that occasion of course would have seen that the management of the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in effect includes land rights because we cannot have one without the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Viner  said that the Northern Territory Land Rights Bill, presently before Parliament, ‘uniquely provides the first example of Australian domestic law expressly recognising Aboriginal cultural values, and implicit in that, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ customary law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was clear to the Aboriginal people that land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> means exactly that and does not mean land rights for a select group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are clear about what they think, what is the problem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory are concerned about national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that the Legislative Assembly will favour the white pastoralists, who is one who comes and goes, who leases the land but do not value the land as we the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning mineral rights we believe that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be approached, that tribes should be approached, before any mining or resource developments take place on their tribal lands and that they should first be part of the decisionmaking processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties recognise the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make land available to tribal and  detribalised  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by allocating money to the Aboriginal Land Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will give traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> inalienable freehold title to land on reserves in the Northern Territory and provide machinery for them to obtain title to traditional land outside reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The coalition Parties’ policy on Aboriginal affairs clearly acknowledges that affinity with the land is fundamental to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘ sense of identity and recognises the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to obtain title to lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives effect to that policy and, further, will provide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory with the opportunity to claim and receive title to traditional Aboriginal land outside reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that this Bill will allow and encourage <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to give full expression to the affinity with land that characterised their traditional society and gave a unique quality to their life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is very much in favour of the gradual integration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into white society and supports that policy very hard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always a tendency for unilateral legislation by the Commonwealth on any subject to be used to confront State governments where developers and special groups like <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> demand the things in Commonwealth legislation that suits their convenience even though conditions in different States are not comparable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet a few nights ago we heard a woman from Darwin saying that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for whom the Federal Government was responsible lived under disgraceful conditions and that their conditions were not nearly as good as those of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some discussions which I heard, he suggested that special arangements would need to be made for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that that body would have at least the approval of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Majority Leader,  Dr Letts,  refused to talk because of some television program on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If good rapport is being established between the Legislative Assembly and the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, no one would suggest that this rapport would be upset or corrupted by giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory equality with the white man’s parliament in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My interpretation of the clause is that the consent of the occupier has to be given in the first place, and if that consent is refused, it would be necessary for the Supervising Scientist to go to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and to establish- the Court having full, conscious knowledge of all the traditions and sacred attitudes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- that there is an overriding public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say to  Senator Cavanagh  that, provided that is the case, I would not grant the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> total exemption from the overriding public interest even though I very much respect the profound and complex Aboriginal culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have full control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued in this chamber that the rights of the public applying to other land do not apply to land that has been granted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the right to refuse persons entry to their area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not studied this matter but I do not believe that the granting of land rights gives an absolute exemption to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> against the ordinary running of the bulk of our ordinary Australian laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody who is interested in the welfare of the Northern Territory seems to have forgotten that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Supervising Scientist is required to have consultations with the Directors of National Parks and Wildlife and the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission but is not required to seek the advice of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the conservation of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not mentioned in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the whole basis of the Viner administration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consulted every white adviser in the Territory but no one thought to consult the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are living there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Coordinating Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Supervising Scientist will be working directly with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the whole matter of the management plan of the national park, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be consulted at every turn and the Supervising Scientist will be walking alongside them every step of the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make it absolutely clear that the tendency to say that the Government is favouring the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, as though it was an alien body, and ignoring the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is wrong, lt is strange that we are talking about what will be a sovereign governing body of a Territory and ultimately a selfgoverning State- that is, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly- and seeing it as some alien thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Constitution the Commonwealth has direct responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth will not abdicate from its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it abundantly clear that the Fraser Government is second to none in its practical desire to further the welfare and dignity of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he has said we have heard since December 1 975- ‘Our concern is for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  through his representative in this chamber,  Senator Guilfoyle,  we hear that every time we ask a question about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Education, or that anyone in the Fraser Government, has made on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His duty is set out in the statute, so he will have to fulfil it, but there is no concern about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  in reply admitted that he was not ashamed of living in the past because he remembers most vividly the treatment that has been meted out to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said often in this place, legislation to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> land rights was introduced into the Parliament on 1 1 November 1975 when the Labor Government was unceremoniously sacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything that  Senator Cavanagh  has said and done, first as a back bencher, then as a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and now again as a back bencher, has been in the best interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Kilgariff  would like to read some speeches in  Hansard  he will find that  Senator Cavanagh  is on record on many occasions as defending <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> against  Senator Kilgariff’s  colleagues in the National Country Party who have tried to exploit them over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what did  Senator Kilgariff  do in the Northern Territory in all the years he had the opportunity to do something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH that  Senator Cavanagh  is seeking in speaking to this amendment is to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory are given the full recognition and the same rights as the white community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an arrangement between the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are left out in the cold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so despite all we hear about what this Government is doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know what is the violent objection that this Government has to including the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the owners of the land, as equal partners in this venture? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best way to facilitate the availability of such a document to the Aboriginal people in the Territory is to table it in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as full citizens of the Territory and of that Parliament will have total access to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have received an assurance that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will get these documents but there is no such provision in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for Education were responsible for seeing that they did and we had a guarantee that he would remain responsible for that we could rest assured that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would get them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, when we provide security for the Parliament and for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in respect of this matter we should give security also to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> just in case the next Minister is not as reputable as the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which of the multitude of newspapers that go to the outback Alligator Rivers Region do the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> read? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would want to know that to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get the information that is contained in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory we are dividing up the northern area into parts on which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may live, some parts for plants and wildlife, and some parts over which mining interests can take control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if in the Northern Territory we see a frizzled, half-alive worm under a rock and it is desired to preserve that worm so that our children and our children’s children for generations to come can go and see a dried up, frizzled half-alive worm then that area has to be preserved for the worm, not for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the position: The worm gets preference over the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of nothing to cause me to question the suggestion that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will more or less lease the land back in the national park concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Reserves Board is a very skilled body, employing numerous skilled people, including <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I am bound to say that over the centuries, the aeons of history, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have camped there, drunk there, eaten kangaroo flesh from there and eaten fish from there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights and interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are recognised in arrangements that may be made under these proposed new sub-clauses by providing that such arrangements shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of any law, including of course the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, or with any agreement between the Commonwealth and an Aboriginal land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will appreciate that the land comprising Stage 1 of the Kakadu National Park is to be granted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to other people, such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and people in that category, who require special consideration and who may need special arrangements made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by the Minister for Health that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are pensioners with pensioner health benefit cards or are dependents of such persons and it is not proposed to abolish bulk billing for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it appears that there are difficulties with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that special problems arise and special needs are noted, the Minister for Health says that he will ensure that the matter is looked at in depth and will try to find a quick solution to any problems which may develop regarding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> advised the Fox Commission that the leases should be perpetual leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff,  who no doubt serves well the great vested interests of the Northern Territory, endeavours to place <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the Senate but because the whole thrust of the arguments put forward in the last five minutes might be misunderstood, the Senate should understand that what this legislation is doing in fact is providing for a great national park- the Kakadu Park- and within it all the hereditary lands for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the way that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have asked; that is, by way of a perpetual leasehold in the national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said yesterday and the day before that I found it singularly distasteful that people felt that they could polarise their views that they had a monopoly of the practical welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that I have been privileged many times in the Northern Territory to associate with senators from both sides of this chamber who, in my judgment, are dedicated to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No man I know is more greatly respected for his work with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No honourable senator on either side of this chamber has any monopoly of practical sympathy or goals for the reform of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the records will show that honourable senators here on both sides of the chamber have done a great deal for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and will do a great deal more in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is such a monopoly; I think there is mass support for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not respect these people, the Bill seeks to give the Country Party dominated Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the right to represent the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not be consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interval before the Bill comes into operation I ask the Minister to see whether he could introduce amendments to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that right and to give them the prestige of equality in regard to their National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen in the last few weeks that the Commonwealth Government has not only a constitutional right, as it has in relation to the granting of export licences, but also a constitutional duty and obligation to make laws with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example in recent years the Uniting Church in Australia in north Queensland has been prosecuting a policy of self-determination for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in the communities of Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there have never had a cash mentality, let alone a cash economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves parasites on the rest of the country- pumping in money and grog- it effectively destroys the Aboriginal culture and lifestyle and also denigrates the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we made more use of ethnologists in Australia rather than health, education and welfare workers with these people we would be a lot better off and so would our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this chamber charges have been made that the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders legislation is discriminatory and repressive and a blight on race relations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so honourable senators must remember that that legislation was designed and approved by the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing I wish to say is that the legislation is what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders wanted and it had built into it all their requirements including continual change up to and including the termination of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was subject to continual scrutiny by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Advisory Council whose advice was given and taken every six months since the inception of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was used against the Indians in the United States and Canada, the Maoris in New Zealand, and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the American Indians but similar short shrift was given to the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who survived only because they could live in deserts that were of no interest at that time to the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survival of these peoples- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, Indians, Eskimoes and Maoris- has largely been due to the recognition of land on which they have been allowed to live and somehow salvage something from the wreckage of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion what is needed now to train the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to live in a white world, as they must, is to give them a selfcontained community of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be an experimental township teaching citizenship to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be an experimental township teaching citizenship to <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>- with <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, already trained in the white world as instructors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>White Australia has come a long way since Governor Philip met his first <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, ls not Black Australia also entitled to some advancement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outback needs its cheap labour force and the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> have been compelled to provide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present system, and with the efforts of a lot of well-meaning people- and a few, quite a few, not so wellmeaning we <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> are being pressured into some kind of off-white uniformity, and never mind what we want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pressures brought to bear on him can make him ready material for the trouble-makers and the groups who like to jump on the social bandwaggon of ‘working for the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>’ welfare.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that the Commonwealth has consistently said that it will provide funds, if necessary, to see that self-management of the two communities can be undertaken by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They ought to go into the record to show the type of people with whom we have to deal in the great struggle for land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been alleged in this chamber and the other place that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in both settlements- certainly in Aurukun- agreed to a six months’ trial period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is merely a dressing up of the Aboriginal Act which has been used to restrict the freedom of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not heard by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because of the application of the two Acts governing the whole lifestyle of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On another occasion I visited a local authority for which grants that had been made directly from the Commonwealth to provide special employment facilities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were held up for many months by the Queensland Government because it was opportune to do so since it was the eve of an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not receive the grant that had been made available to maintain full employment, apparently for political purposes, mattered very little to the Queensland Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of political wheeling and dealing is going on all the time with regard to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1967 the Queensland Government has made available very little funding in percentage terms compared with previous funding, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Yarrabah, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are producing cattle, at Palm Island small amounts of bananas and other tropical fruits are being produced and at Cherbourg and other settlements artifacts are manufactured; but the proceeds go directly to the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement and not to the people on the communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s very much in the interests of the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> to allow the officers in.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign for land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is widespread in spite of what we may have heard in recent statements coming out of the Northern Territory and from the National Party Government of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continued development of the outstation movement is an important element in ensuring that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have freedom of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Aboriginal and other delegates, many of whom are well known in the academic world, saw fit to produce a statement of that nature indicates quite clearly that there is wide-ranging support for land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that corridor, which I understand is likely to be a fairly wide corridor, is granted to the mining company, it is likely that it will go through sites of significance in the Borrooloola area, which is only a small area which has now been granted to the local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assimilation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into white Australia society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all effective purposes, there are still no land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia today, with the exception of minor freehold areas and leasehold areas that have been purchased on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If something does not happen legislatively within the immediate future it will be a very sad day for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, when is the Government going to define who is an Aborigine, particularly in view of the fact that people classified as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> receive so many concessions that this opens up for people the opportunity to obtain concessions to which they are not entitled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not within the knowledge of the Minister that many persons of part Indian or negro descent and people who are three-quarters or seven-eighths white are parading as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is understood by those departments which need to deal with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that they have access to the programs and benefits that are arranged for Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department has some ways of identifying <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in regard to some of the claims which are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that millions of dollars or sums of Sim arc being handed over for enterprises to people who claim that they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> overlooks the guidelines of all the programs that exist to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing associations and other groups of people use special programs that have been devised for assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding some diversity of viewpoints, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with one voice are asserting the right to- self-management; land rights; additional funds; self-sufficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said quite clearly by the  Deputy  Premier of Queensland last Sunday night on television- it was said at the Liberal Party State conference earlier in the day- that there was a clear division between the policies of the Queensland Government and the Federal Government in relation to land rights and to the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told, from the policy speech I read and which was enunciated in 1975 and spelt out in slightly less words again in 1977, that the policy of the Government is supposed to be selfdetermination and self-management for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we debated the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976 and the recent legislation in relation to Queensland whereby the Federal Government was going to be the big, bold boy and march in and look after the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we suggested a number of amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of them were designed to meet the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has not suffered; the Queensland Government has not suffered; but the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have suffered as a result of the fear of this Government about providing the sort of legislation that is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause is a breakdown of the requirements of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is not prepared to understand the meaning of it, even though she knows it will do great damage to a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government took steps to ensure self-management for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aurukun and Mornington Island, but  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  simply de-gazetted the reserves and the Federal legislation was rendered useless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was done for the consortium’s advantage, not for the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that throughout the whole of the debates we have had with regard to legislation which affects <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in any way whatsoever the consultation which can be undertaken is an important part of the development of that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say, as  Senator Sir Reginald  Wright has said, that the legislation is purposeless, I think, overlooks what can be achieved by consultation which is undertaken in good faith and with the purpose of achieving for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the best type of Bill that we can with regard to their councils and associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in spite of the policies which I have read and which have been enunciated by the Liberal Party and the National Country Party in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It just shows that this Government has no intention of doing anything for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> except in that area in which it is forced to do something because it has its back to the wall as it fears a vote might go over its head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with great regret that I observe that  Senator Guilfoyle,  the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this chamber, is now becoming a  Dr No  or, if I may be sexist,  Dr Noess  because she is refusing everything that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all of the objectives which the Government has been seeking to achieve since it assumed office it has been leaning towards legislation which has given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> many opportunities to achieve selfmanagement and to have a greater degree of development than has been the case in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If by the process of consultation with State governments, with local authorities, with Aboriginal community groups and with individuals we are able to provide in the future other means of assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we will have achieved a great deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to the Aboriginal people, the Government does not propose to give any reasons at all because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not supposed to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether it is not a fact that housing loans are given by the Commonwealth Government to people who profess to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, some of whom probably have hardly a blush of Aboriginal colour in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood  has drawn attention to the housing loans that may be made available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to house themselves and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government regards the programs, in both instances, as desirable and effective means of assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to have special programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that make available to them some of the benefits that exist through the range of programs that are available to other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To apply the Aboriginal Housing Loans scheme to other Australians who do not claim to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would defeat the purpose of the special provision that has been made for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve had an Aboriginal council meeting here in Alice Springs, with representatives from the rural areas, to discuss the effects the transfer of powers will have on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ‘s inevitable that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be worst hit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that they can split the vote, in particular the vote of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government support the abolition of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act (Queensland) 1971. and the Torres Strait Islanders Act (Queensland) 1971 and take such action as they deem necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Queensland Discriminating Laws Act, 1975 and the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 be enforced in so far as they relate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken on a number of occasions in response to  Senator Wood’s  questions on the matter of funds and programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the resolution did talk about handouts to Aboriginal groups and if it said that handouts should be given only to groups which have special needs, I think that body should recognise the very special needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in many parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister also said that it should be noted that Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, from both within and outside the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, have attended meetings of the Assembly and thereby have gained valuable experience and have exchanged views with other indigenous peoples around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On several occasions during Question Time I have said that the Government is considering ways in which it can deal with community health centres, or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or low income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These projects are considered by the NH and MRC Medical Research in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Subcommittee for approval before funding, and have included the study of such conditions as trachoma, gastro-enteritis, nutritional deficiencies and dental caries among various segments of the Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Mornington Island and Aurukun are affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that those remarks of his reflect the discussion that has taken place and the concern that we all feel with regard to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us cast our minds over recent events and some of the statements by the Premier of Queensland to see whether the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have self-management and self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where better can we give them those rights so they can frustrate those who seek to exploit Aboriginal land to the disadvantage of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to destroy the environment in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first trouble of recent times occurred when the Whitlam Government came to power and started its program of hand-outs to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always reject <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being considered different from other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us treat <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal and State authorities which look after Aboriginal affairs, plus the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, should work this problem out without the assistance of all the stirrers and without debate that is going on in the public forum today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did tell the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at that secret meeting that they had the right to freehold land if they bought it like anybody else in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he made the statement to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he also must have had a temporary lapse of memory because an application for the transfer of title of land at Ayr which a local Aboriginal community group wanted to purchase to establish a caravan park was refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of such a small business would have kept at least three or four <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in constant employment, but permission to take over the land by way of transfer of title was refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also must have forgotten about leasehold land at Cardwell which another group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted to purchase for farming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pretty hypocritical to say to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that the only way they can get title to their land is to purchase the freehold title and in the four instances I have mentioned to refuse to allow the transfer of titles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be fair to say that the Opposition members have brought it before us again today out of a sense of impatience about the apparent slow rate of progress towards achieving self-management for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Mornington Island and Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 963 1 was fortunate enough to be appointed to a joint select committee which was established to investigate the grievances of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the Gove Peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should take urgent action on matters arising out of the 1977 Report by the Community Relations office relating to ‘Discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in North Queensland ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grants from the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefit Trust Fund (now the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account) where the advisory committee satisfies itself as to the eligibility of any individual applicants on the basis of reports from staff or certification by an Aboriginal organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people who have made inquiries about assistance from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefit Trust Fund have not proceeded with applications after discussing their eligibility with staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They remained here, living under much the same conditions as their counterpart- we, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Torres Strait Islanders- suffering prejudice, discrimination, lack of opportunity for employment, decent housing, education and everything else that we, the indigenes of this country, suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we take it that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those places should not receive rights over and above those given to any other Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations Human Rights Commission, which  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  has had the temerity to call in aid on his own behalf, would, I suggest, be only too delighted to have an opportunity to scrutinise the state of liberty in  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  ‘s own backyard and to consider not only the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Aurukun and Mornington Island, which the Premier himself concedes to be at least controversial, but also the systematic denigration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders generally in that State which is embodied in the legislation of that State which purports to govern the affairs of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the form  Aborigine  is not acceptable as an alternative to  Aboriginal  for the singular noun,  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>  may be used as an alternative plural form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an effort to establish an Australian and international racial identity for the indigenous persons of mainland Australia and Tasmania, I ask the Minister to refer to such people by using the words ‘Aborigine’ for the singular noun and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ for the plural noun as contained in the  Concise Oxford Dictionary  1976, sixth edition, and for the word ‘Aborigine’ to have a capital A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To set an example for the  Style Manual,  I ask the Minister to make this change from the use of the noun ‘Aboriginal’ so that we, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, will not be referred to in the same manner as indigenous persons of other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is only in this way that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia can truly feel unique, as we are, and gain an identity of our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The form ‘Aborigine’ is not acceptable as an alternative to Aboriginal’ for the singular noun, but ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ may be used as an alternative plural form ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that some people prefer the forms ‘Aborigine’ and ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, I feel sure that the discussions he could arouse from the comments he has made in this question would be of interest to the Committee that seeks to give the dignity to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia that we all believe signifies the unique qualities that they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am greatly concerned that most correspondence I receive these days contains some complaint about the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and particularly the treatment by the Federal Government of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aurukun and Morington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I received a letter from the Quakers Society of New South Wales asking that the Government take over that land in Queensland and whether I would declare my position on the Government ‘s intentions with regard to the demand for recognition of land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always tried to approach the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on a non-party basis, in the belief that despite what may appear to be the position at the present time there are many Government members with good intentions of trying to assist these unfortunate people who have been done a disservice in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It occurs to me at this time that even the Cabinet which may be desirous of helping <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may feel that it is restrained because of the legal position on the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only speakers on this side of the Senate but also people throughout the whole of the community who say that the Government has the constitutional authority to acquire land and to hand it over to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the belief that the legal advisers to the Government and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs also may have some doubts as to whether the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to take over land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the belief that the people of Australia voted in the 1967 referendum the way they did because they believed it would mean a better deal for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 92 per cent of the people in all electorates in Australia, including Queensland, voted to give to the Federal Government power for the purpose of bettering the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, despite any possible fears about what power it has, should act upon the basis that it believes it has the power and should acquire land on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in such a way that there would be a challenge to the High Court for the purpose of determining the actual legal position in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although everyone today thinks that in 1967 the people gave power to the Federal Government for the control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is that the real position? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The book deals with the land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is feeling among the majority of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they are justified in wanting the traditional land that is significant to their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we must introduce a land rights Bill for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no question of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> taking valuable land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was claimed that this constitutional provision discriminated against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> insofar as the same laws could not apply to them as applied to other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the referendum in 1967 and despite the fact that it was fought on the ground of a better go for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we deleted the words ‘other than the aboriginal race in any State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One legal opinion I have seen assumes that the High Court could well rule that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not people of a special race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court could well uphold the view that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who were here before us, are Australians as are Europeans who have come to this country since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 the Federal Parliament showed its intention to make special laws for people of a particular race, namely, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Quick and Garran are correct, no discriminatory Jaw of a State concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can have any effect at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Anti-Discriminatory (Queensland Laws) Act, under which we decided to accept <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as people of a particular race, is a valid law, then the laws which Bjelke-Petersen is operating today are not valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any honesty and sincerity in the present public agitation for a return of land to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and if we are to recognise a sanctity of land to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the necessity for their continued culture and well-being, then we should do something definite about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the signing of the agreement achieved as a result of a threat by the Prime Minister that failure to sign would result in the withdrawal of funding for the Northern Land Council and for other activities carried out by or on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem embraces young people, people with acute psychological problems, and many more of the people now concerned than previously are women and children and many are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will get a total of $2 8.1m, representing an increase of 1 1 per cent, and migrants will get a total of $27.8m, representing a substantial increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we use the term we should also include our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country are now again, slowly, becoming aware of the fact that our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not the Stone Age primitives that many Australians traditionally considered them to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now aware that the standards of behaviour of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves are now struggling to discern, to define, to write down and to preserve what is left of their culture- what has not been damaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is probably one of the most articulate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the whole of Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is one of the most prominent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the whole of Australia today not only because he is  chairman  of the Northern Land Council but also because of the way he has conducted himself, the way he has endeavoured to bring about solutions to the problems of land rights and the way he has handled the problems of his people in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who is trying to destroy this young man who has become the leader of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout this Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now a figure to whom all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout this nation look. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, members of the Queensland Northern Council, the people at Aurukun and Mornington Island and all the Aboriginal communities in Queensland are looking to young <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Galarrwuy because he has given leadership to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these people destroy this young man’s credibility then they will destroy the credibility of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their fight for what I believe they are rightly and justly entitled to, and that is their land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why can they not just for once listen and let us <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say what is good for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, with regard to the Northern Territory Consultative Group on Aboriginal Education, funds have been provided for 1978-79 to support the operation of such a group which will provide advice on the provision of education for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My experience in this regard over the years is that there always seems to be someone ready to discredit them and to prove that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not capable of making decisions or of accepting responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It brought a response from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would involve the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in its discussions and try to meet their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was necessary because the Government has a long history of building inappropriate houses, a hangover from the days when there was a feeling that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should become like other Australians, have the same lifestyle, the same clothes, the same education, the same work habits and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other view, again very well meaning, was that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were entitled to the same housing as white Australians, the suggestion being that it must be ‘as good as’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this would not meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but simply leave the people who made the decisions with a clear conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland, the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement has encapsulated its policy in the statement, ‘We don’t build houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- we build houses for people  It reflects Queensland ‘s stated objective of treating <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> like any other citizen, but it is similarly a facade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the demise of the panel will not alter the quality of service provided to all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say that the Government has acted in a way in which the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill was originally drafted and proposed to allow the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to negotiate on the terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that is precisely what this Government is doing, driving the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> back into that history of neglect and grinding poverty, and laughing all the way to the bank while it reduces the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Land Council of Queensland- the people at Aurukun and Mornington Island and all the Aboriginal communities in Queensland are looking to young Galarrwuy because he has given leadership to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister is an expert at dividing and conquering, not only at dividing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and conquering them but also at dividing the community and trying to conquer it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They decided to take over and to show the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that was good for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite recently a group of concerned <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and a group of concerned people of European origin wrote letters to members of the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to quote a few paragraphs from each of those two letters to emphasise my point that there are groups of people in this country who are just as concerned as all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in .the Northern Territory and who do not want to proceed with uranium mining or, if uranium mining is going to proceed because of the pressures applied, they want it to be done on their terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will indicate first of all the number of people from each of the States of Australia who signed the letter from the group of concerned <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia 8 prominent Aboriginal people signed the letter; in Queensland 35 people; in New South Wales 28 people; in Victoria 8 people; in Tasmania, where allegedly all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been wiped out, one responsible person signed the letter; in Western Australia 5 people; in the Australian Capital Territory 5 people; and the letter was signed also by a member of one of the Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has some control over the Benefits Trust, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> gain little selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Further no net benefit is gained financially by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in exchange for the desecration of traditional lands which will following mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen a report in the  Sunday Sun  newspaper of 24 September 1978 wherein it was reported that 100 local residents on Bribie Island, Queensland, have signed a petition to be presented to the honourable C. R. Porter, M.L.A., the Queensland Minister for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Advancement, opposing the construction by his Department of a holiday home on that Island to be used by selected families from the Cherbourg Aboriginal Mission on the grounds that such a home and its intended inhabitants would have a detrimental effect on surrounding land values? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 3 1 August  Mr Anderson  was at a seminar of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League at Northcote in Victoria and there was told by a member ofthe executive of the Conference,  Mrs Nessie  Skuta, that he had not been appointed and that she was surprised that he was in Australia because the executive had been told that he was out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am motivated to raise this question tonight because of recent statements by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and in particular by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  that, regardless of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ wishes, uranium mining will go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to stress that when I referred to some Labor people putting environment or mining issues before <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I certainly did not have in mind any of our spokespersons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever smooth talk you might get from our critics to try to convince you that we did not make such offers in good faith, I will continue to assure you of our moral support and our intentions when we return to Government to strengthen Land Rights legislation in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as we tried to in parliament in 1975 and 1976 despite a hostile Senate and later losing our Government majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make special mention of Bob Collins because I believe everything he has done in this recent Ranger dispute business has been at the request of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and strictly in line with their wishes and their so widely expressed yearning to control their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in spite of assurances by  Mr Groom  that the road goahead did not pre-empt the decision on the main Jabiluka operations, <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> regarded the move as direct provocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  chairman  of the NLC,  Mr James  Yunupingu, then reported that <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> might not sign the Ranger agreement and so a meeting was hastily convened between the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser, Mr Yunupingu, Mr Viner  and  Mr Anthony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is not true because the mining is going to go ahead whether or not the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no intention of caring for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at this stage in view of the statement that has been made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe from discussions with other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that the traditional owners of the land the subject of the Ranger Agreement, were told by the Northern Land Council chairman at a meeting at Merganella in July 1978, that the mining pits which would form part of the proposed mine would be refilled level with the ground at the completion ofthe mining under the proposed arrangement and that the Northern Land Council would insist that this formed part of any agreement made with the Commonwealth or with the developers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about the people who are driving the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into their graves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As people often say about we <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, he is a victim of his circumstances and his environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They pretend to be the champions of the underdog and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  stood here tonight and gave us a tirade on how he was so concerned for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twice in this chamber tonight I have heard <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> attacked by members of the Labor Party- firstly by  Senator Keeffe  and  Senator Mulvihill  at an Estimates Committee meeting and later by  Senator Keeffe  who attacked me, a proud Aborigine, one of those whom he alleges to be one of the champions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand your feeling that the ALP may be using <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for their own vested interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘most of them on the Labor side of polities’-  care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were a number of non-Aboriginals- a number of balanda, as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would say in the Northern Territory, breaking their necks to get into that meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> said: You will not come in here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are members of the Labor Party who are certainly very hypocritical and they have shown their hypocrisy this evening on two separate occasions when two <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were attacked at an Estimates Committee hearing in this chamber by those purporting to be the champions and supporters of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They support <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> while <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not try to be their equals, do not try to determine their own future, and do not start to raise their heads above the crowd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of person cannot abide such developments and will attack viciously those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who try to equal them or even, on some occasions, better them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I met the  Deputy Chairman  in another part of Darwin when a problem existed in relation to some of the itinerant tribal, traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had come into Darwin and were living on some of the reserve lands around Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did he make inflammatory statements about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory designed to aggravate further the already tense situation that exists there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leave be given to introduce a Bill for an Act relating to the admissibility of confessions made by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders and related matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sufficient to say that since that date a lot of water has passed under the bridge and to the shame of this nation, a lot more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders have gone to prison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To further reinforce the need for the provisions of this Bill, I quote directly from  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, A Statement of Concern,  prepared by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, for the Catholic Bishops of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the  Australian  Government was for a time unable to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination’ of the United Nations because of the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘ and Torres Strait Islanders ‘ Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law has offered little protection to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end result is that  Senator Bonner  has been able to claim that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the most imprisoned people in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1974 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> comprised between 6 per cent and 9 per cent of the prison population in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their rate of imprisonment was at least 1 7 times that of non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each year from 1973 to 1975 magistrates courts in Western Australia sentenced more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than nonAborigines to imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> comprise 2.1 per cent of the population of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In July 1972 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> made up 15.3 per cent of the total daily average prison population in South Australia and 5 1.33 per cent of the female prison population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Queensland Police Union of Employees I bring to your notice details of Private Member’s Bill as  proposed by  Senator Bonner  such Bill being entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill 1976’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen that in each state the numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are recorded together with the percentage of the total population added to which are figures in respect to the Torres Strait Islanders who also may be found amongst our coloured community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report made the following recommendations in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After almost three years under a conservative government the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in many areas have returned virtually to what they were before 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as the Minister said, the money is a direct contribution to selfmanagement and participation by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that is a good point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Loans Commission, which was established to provide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with loans at slightly lower than normal interest rates, particularly in relation to housing, has now indicated that it will be eight to ten years before anybody on the waiting list is likely to obtain a loan to purchase or to construct a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without land rights the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were destined to die, the leader of the Queensland’s Mornington Island people,  Mr Larry  Lanely,  said at an international seminar in Adelaide yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deny <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> access to their cultural base of the land was to deny basic human rights, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the old people saw many problems when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> moved away from the Aboriginal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They echo the sentiments and the feelings of tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see a repudiation of that policy in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the current struggle which is going on with the transnational mining companies who are trying to get out of the ground the uranium in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, pressure was applied by the Queensland Government to the Commonwealth Government not to introduce any scheme which might upgrade the living standards of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> residing on Aboriginal communities in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> pay more for their foodstuffs and for their needs than white people pay on any of the islands have to pay is racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked for details of the leases, the payment of royalties and how many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is entitled, therefore, to ask whether all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were party to this agreement in fact knew what was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do Government senators really believe that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whose culture is entirely different from our own and whose understanding of white laws is entirely different from our own, have had these provisions properly presented to them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned not only whether the spirit and the intent of the law have been carried out but also whether the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were given every opportunity to consider all the implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ill behoves the Minister in the other place who presented the report- I appreciate that  Senator Guilfoyle  is only presenting the report in this place on his behalf- to quote only one portion of the second Ranger report and ignore the most important conclusion of all in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When questions were asked today in this place by some of my colleagues about the accuracy of reports that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not properly consulted, we did not get very satisfactory answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that there would not be very many honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber- certainly not many honourable senators on my side of the chamber- who would not assert that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be affected by the development of uranium mining, particularly in the Ranger area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second one was a clear indication that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want their own land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is finished obviously the aerodrome will be able to take very much larger planes than those which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need in that area now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only in very recent weeks that three or four <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been given a job on the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot have land rights and everything that goes with them, then obviously they have to be given something in the interim that will work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other criticism to which I want to refer- I think that it is most unfair- relates to the delegation of three people who have gone overseas to publicise the manner in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are treated in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff has raised three questions with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These benefits would not be received by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if this mining did not proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are any royalties paid from the Cape Flattery Silica Sand Mining complex to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Hopevale community, or are royalties paid directly to the Church administering the Hopevale community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Hopevale Community are employed at the Cape Flattery Silica Sand Mining venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed on a casual basis or do they have full time work; if the latter, are proper award wages being paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) and (2) The Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs has advised me that: ‘The Company is required to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and /or Islanders in all positions and occupations which they are capable of filling and to pay the usual Award rates applicable to the particular occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a question about employment prospects for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the event of uranium mining proceeding in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister: How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are now permanently employed at each of the three main mining centres in the Northern Territory, namely, Groote Eylandt, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, what was the percentage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed in the work force at each of these three mining centres that I have mentioned in each of the last six years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister tell the Senate what guidelines, if any, have been drawn up by the Government to ensure the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Ranger if the project goes ahead? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the infant mortality rate of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that the Alice Springs Community College has conducted a number of vocational courses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Alice Springs area during 1978 and continues to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has a responsibility, along with the States, local government and enterprise, to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, for the information of honourable senators, I have a statement outlining the information and electoral education services which the Australian Electoral Office has been developing over the last two years and in particular the most significant advances that have occurred in the areas of ethnic groups, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have faulty fuel stoves in their houses that have caused great problems and have disfigured their houses considerably, none of these problems have been looked at by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Carports have been built for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> even when no one in the houshold has a driving licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These dealers see the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> coming and say to them, How much have you got to spend?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President of the Territory Automobile Association,  AANT,  believes the Association should be prepared for the time when Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will form a significant sector of the car-owning community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President,  Captain Tom Milner, said under existing circumstances where the majority of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live a segregated existence on isolated communities, few were among the driving public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He predicted that with future development and ‘as mining royalties begin to flow’ many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would become vehicle owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to remember that the Panel ‘s principal concern is with remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know, one of the principal functions of the Panel was to blend the expertise of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, anthropologists and architects to develop housing schemes which would be uniquely suited to the special needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Panel is the only organization in Australia which has consistently designed and had constructed successful housing schemes for remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, initially, we focussed on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in or near an urban environment, on the empirical evidence that they had elected to live and work in close contact with the European dominated market economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first prototype designs were completed by November 1976, have since been built, and are now being occupied most successfully by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for whom they were designed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By developing prototypes where a demonstrable need existed, the Panel could be sure that, when it assessed a prototype, it could evaluate it in terms of the specific requirements for housing and the behavioural modes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Panel also expected that, by locating the first prototypes in or near an urban centre, they would come to the attention of many more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> (visitors to the town) than they would if they were located in a remote location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way, they were likely to excite comment and, in doing this, yield insights into what other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> thought about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know, the Department of Construction charges professional fees to Aboriginal associations and I can only assume that the difference between the fees the Panel could charge and its annual budget, if the work has been performed by the Department of Construction, would be lost to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems no conceivable reason why <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would, having rejected similar huts in the 1960s, accept them in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do, however, emphasize that this is an Aboriginal body which, in terms of priorities, acts for the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> like to develop a relationship with one person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of your professed policy of Aboriginal self-management, your decision to cease funding the only Aboriginal organization undertaking a research and development role in housing remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia appears to be a denial of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decide their own priorities and the ways they want to give expression to them and, thus, practice self-management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also told him of a report which McNeil and Downing had seen, and which the writer, a public servant, intended to make to the Easter Conference of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Co-op employs a few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and only one European, the manager. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had been to Warrabri this month, and was told by the manager that he was told by Welfare representatives that as signatory for the co-op he had power to sign it over to Welfare as a social club, and if he did so the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would take a long time to find out, and in any case would not understand the legal processes, also they would guarantee him twice the wages he was receiving currently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this plan is quite different from those first proposed by Stawell for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and that this plan appeared only after  Mr McNeil  had been asked by  Mr Cook  for a plan of the Aputula house and had later found his plan in  Mr Cook’s  office with a Stawell Timber Industries stamp on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He eventually named  Mr Jack  Cook,  Mr Warren  Smith,  Mr Tony  Barker, and  Mr Laurie  Lumsden, and ‘several <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’, but could not supply names of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our query is this- why has a private company been brought into this picture to add to costs and drain off profit benefit when a tradesman has been appointed on good money to supervise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in building? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also reported that the club has complied for an allowance for the woman manager’s wage as a trainer of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been carrying out work amongst the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> for a number of years and, prior to that, carried out work in New Guinea for Missions in connection with hospitals, churches, bakeries, housing and other facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From our economic analysis of the costs of work in the Northern Territory carried out by the <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, we believe that a total house suitable for a family could be built for approximately $ 1 0,000.00 including the connection to services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my experience over three years I can only say that those colleges, along with Dhupuma College, have performed very essential services in providing residential colleges for young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever I go amongst the settlements and outstations throughout the Northern Territory, I find the influence of the young people from these residential colleges to be for the good and the leadership of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an influence that is retaining the culture of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, yet bringing something of the knowledge, understanding and knowhow of the Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that what is happening at Kormilda and Yirara is that we are providing a flow to these settlements and outstations of people who will be vitally influential to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he is aware of an article which appeared in the  Canberra Times  of 18 November 1978 under the headline ‘Ignoring the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and which, in part, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There appears to be some doubt about whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> exist, or ever have existed, in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further ask: Will the Minister be kind enough to inform the Western Australian Government that learned anthropologists have proven conclusively that we, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, have been in Australia for 50,000 years at least and that, considering that Western Australia is part of Australia, it is logical to assume that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> existed in that State for 50,000 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our conclusion in respect of that particular power is that it is such as to fully enable the Commonwealth to act in any conceivable way that it might wish to in conferring self-management rights on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Tones Strait Islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, what we do in the report is to list a series of alternative courses of legislative action in which the Commonwealth could constitutionally engage so as to secure effective self-management rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is told that all it is really doing is pressuring the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary how, before the agreement with the Aboriginal people was signed, we heard comments about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having too many rights, about apartheid in reversal and about the interests of the white people of Australia being sacrificed in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that in rather dubious circumstances this agreement has been signed, we find people like  Senator Kilgariff  castigating people and talking about every method under the sun being used to have the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not sign the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this Government used every method under the sun to pressure the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into signing the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If housing is not reserved for white staff only, how many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will live in the new homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could have a referendum to determine whether they wanted to be under State or Federal Government control, the Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement Minister (  Mr Porter)  said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he doubted whether <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> would want such a poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Porter  said that if such a referendum were held, he had no doubt the States’ <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> would opt for Queensland control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the Government’s policy of concern for the implementation of legislation to defend the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their land which has been so much debated in Parliament in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This statement, like so many of the Government’s statements which are placed before the Senate, ignores the basic problems that beset the uranium industry, ignores the basic problems that face <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area, ignores the commitments that we have made to protect that environment and ignores the commitments that we have made to establish the essential national parks in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not suggesting that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are going to take such action but certainly they could do so and they could frustrate the present plans of the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly those who come from the traditional areas, do not have a full realisation of the actual value of European currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> received cash vouchers or ticket vouchers for the purchase of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had no sense of value; that if he had a sports coat for sale for 4, it was quite in order to put an 8 tag on the coat because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would pay that price anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is possible that the two Acts under which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland have to live are even more restrictive than those of South Africa and Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Community/Reserve established under ‘The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and Torres Strait Islanders’ Regulations of 1966’ and acting in accordance with the provisions of such regulations hereby makes the following By-Laws to have force and effect within the area of the said . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these By-Laws, unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, the terms defined by Section 5 of ‘The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and Torres Strait Islanders’ Affairs Act of 196S ‘ and by Regulation 2 of ‘The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ and Torres Strait Islanders’ Regulations of 1966’ shall have the same meaning as is assigned to them by such section and regulation and the following terms shall have the meanings set against them respectively, that is to say: ‘Authorised person’- A person from time to time authorised by the Council or Manager - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Commissioner for Community Relations has a copy and there are a number of others that float around but normally it is a document that is not shown to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know this because in my office in Townsville we frequently have to obtain copies of the Act for individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders who may come to the office seeking a copy to study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What he said to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the Archer River case on Cape York, where a white man who owned a lease was prepared to sell it to a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission was prepared to buy it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That deal was cancelled and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not allowed to buy that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Cardwell wanted to expand their area and purchase, at a small price, a lease in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the worst case was in Ayr where two or three <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> got together, obtained a small parcel of land and decided that there was a need in the area for a caravan park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The council, the local people and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> approved of it and the expertise was there to run it, but the Queensland Lands Department would not approve the transfer of the title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should take urgent action on matters arising out of the 1977 Report by the Community Relations Office relating to ‘Discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in North Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past hour  Senator Keeffe  has given an outline of the misery suffered by and the discrimination exercised against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I connect with the 1977 report the third annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations- the 1978 report which deals with, among other matters, discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 21 of the report the Commissioner, having referred to some 20 or 2 1 cases of racial discrimination in Queensland, in particular discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, makes this point: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers were alleged to have made the following remarks about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have brains not much larger than chimpanzees and should be treated accordingly’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be an open season on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more arrogant man could not be found, and he should not have the responsibility for the lives of some 50,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>DAIA states in the 1971 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act to become a resident you have to fill out a residency form and it has to be passed by the Council and then sent to Brisbane to be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Cotton chippers near Narrabri were forced to lie flat on their faces when a low-flying aircraft sprayed insecticide over them, the New South Wales Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A community health nurse read the letter to the Committee in Narrabri last week during a hearing on the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working in the cotton fields near Narrabri and Wee Waa, in the north-west of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the report recommend, among other measures, involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in decisions affecting their health, involvement in the delivery of their own health care and recognition of the special health needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What other measures will the Minister take to improve the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in view of the alarming conclusions of the report to which I have referred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Chipp  asked me what other measures I will take to improve the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the light of the conclusions in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another recommendation which commends itself is the need for a special effort to increase the numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are employed in skilled trades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there should be no thought of any legal inhibition on the Government taking any steps that it considers appropriate to secure genuine self-management for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government took the control away from the tribal elders in those areas which seemed to be prospering fairly well and placed it under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act with complete control going to the bureaucrats in Brisbane under the conditions which permeate throughout Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly concerned that, while we dilly-dally and do nothing, we do not know what will happen to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It condemns the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act, tells of the conditions at Aurukun and Mornington Island and points out the statistics on the infant mortality rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word ‘Aboriginals’, rather than the currently more widely preferred expression <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’, has been used throughout this Report to conform with the use of that word in the long title to the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal land has economic, social, religious and sacred importance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have lost the best land, but the small areas of Aboriginal reserves that remain are still of major importance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 975 the Senate unanimously carried a resolution which called for compensatory legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Porter  denied unequivocally that Australia had broken any of the international conventions in relation to our treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the most imprisoned people in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders comprise two per cent of the total population but 35 per cent of the prison population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in particular to the Local Government Act which has been passed by the Queensland Government and which gives government officials extraordinary powers over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, partly because leases are vested in local authorities, which may be one non-Aboriginal person, as at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not allowed by those who stand over them- I am referring now to those people in the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement- to exercise authority over these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Vicky Kippin has got no more idea of what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want than has the Premier,  Mr Porter  or  Mr Hinze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was shocked and surprised when, after somebody asked him what was happening, he said: ‘Hundreds of thousands of dollars are available to this group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wander around the remote areas of Queensland- Cape York and the Gulf of Carpentaria’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has, on many occasions in the last year or so, discussed the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has the temerity and arrogance to threaten the New South Wales Government about its legitimate right to take action in respect of matters which affect the industrial welfare of a section of its work force; yet it refuses to act in respect of its obligations and responsibilities and its promises on many occasions concerning the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government is faced with its responsibilities and obligations to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland, the pious talk and platitudes that have been synonymous with its approach to the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had to judge the attitude of the Government and of the Minister I would have to conclude that it would go to water in respect of Queensland and Aurukun and Mornington Island, and its responsibilities to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation, says the Minister’s own Department, is in the Commonwealth Government’s view discriminatory and outdated, primarily because it gives government officials extraordinary powers to manage and direct the lives of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders on reserves, trusteeships on reserves and the right to negotiate on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders about land use and in particular exploration and mining on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also gives them the power to manage the property of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs inform the Parliament whether his Government intends to make further cutbacks in financial allocations for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during the current financial year as part of the Government’s program to reduce the deficit from $4 billion to $2.5 billion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give a promise to the Parliament that there will be no further cutbacks this year and that the total Budget allocation for 1978-79 will in fact be spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether the land rights policy enunciated a few days ago by the Mining Council and set out as a working or suggestion paper is likely to become the policy of his Department in relation to Aboriginal land rights and also the social aspects associated with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I saw today a letter from  Mr Charles  Porter in which he refused even to discuss with the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Australia,  Dr Everingham,  the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, it was land which no one else desired- and no one will desire it until such time as minerals are found there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have lost the right to control roads that run through their areas- a power which previously was contained in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly accepted the roads as roads, we are told that an alteration will be sought to the legislation to enable roads which are unrecognised by the Commonwealth but are in Aboriginal land to be taken away from the control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the case if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> come to me as they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our concern is that this sustained campaign is designed to achieve modification of both the land rights legislation and the administration of it- modifications which, if adopted, would totally undermine the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to administer and own their traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course that legislation, which enjoyed the support of the Labor Party, conceded that there was a profound association of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with their traditional land, that there were deep cultural ties and that land plays a fundamental and unique role in their cultural identity and their right to own and administer the land in perpetuity for present and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very serious conflict of interests between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the AMIC over the land rights legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister concedes, there is in the Parliament an attitude of support for those general principles, which are being assailed, which are being challenged and which the Government is being asked to change because they do not suit the economic interests of those who seek to exploit the areas of land which we are endeavouring to have transferred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so as to give security and to carry out our obligations on the cultural affinities that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see in having title to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not raising matters concerning Aboriginal settlements in Queensland it is talking about the land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ordinary <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in north Queenslandparticularly Torres Strait islanders- are sick to death of all the stirrers around the place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that these will not be the result of pressure by the Australian Mining Industry Council and that they will be discussed in full with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 976 when the legislation was introduced we warned the Government that it was doing a damaging thing to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory by handing over power to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know the attitude of many members of that Assembly- both previous and current- to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether the Minister knows about the Larakia area at Darwin where the local Legislative Assembly has said that it will not object to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having land but that they will have a road through the middle of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area do not want the road because they have small children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>He suggested that the matter should be left to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to negotiate with the Government and the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were totally excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Comalco company also excluded the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> this means death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though they do not physically die, when all the things that they have been associated with for generations are taken away <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might as well be killed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1869 Archbishop Polding made a statement which was not repeated until a publication entitled  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, A Statement of Concern  was prepared by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace for the Catholic bishops of Australia last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publication on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> also states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today still face that same threat and the desperate plight of others is met with indifference, because similar values and attitudes based on cultural and racial difference persist among many white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early 1970s there was a widespread determination among politicians and many others in the community to respond to the challenges being forcefully articulated by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister is a little testy about the Opposition charging the Australian Mining Industry Council with doing the wrong thing by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so I will refer to a book entitled  From Massacres to Mining- The Colonization of Aboriginal Australia  written recently by Janine Roberts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They first wanted to move the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ homes far from Weipa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They used for this the pretext of ‘protecting’ the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comalco developed the mining town as a nearly all white town with just a nominal number of selected <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They stated that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> needed to be specially qualified before they would be allowed to live in the mining town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not remind the people who run these areas that a referendum was held in 1967 which gave the Commonwealth very wide powers to legislate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that- this will be a matter for another argument at a later date- we find that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in many parts of Australia are slipping back to where they were before 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A land use strategy plan involving the granting of Aboriginal land rights to substantial areas, which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves had indicated they would then lease to be managed as a national park for the nation, was seen as central to the inquiry’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the Queensland Governmenttook  the control away from the tribal elders in those areas which seemed to be prospering fairly well and placed it under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act with complete control going to the bureaucrats in Brisbane under the conditions which permeate throughout Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country parties recognise that if a policy of self-management is to be effective, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must play a leading role in their affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will include <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> playing a significant role: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which this co-operation has now been forthcoming and productive means that we should look back to the report to see what it said could be done and how it could be done to safeguard the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area without going through the process  of complete acquisition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the liberty of commenting on what  Mr Viner  said today in another place when he virtually heaped tons of praise on the Queensland Government for its enlightened attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The report showed a spirit of unanimity, with the Labor Party members of the Committee and the Liberal Party members of the Committee all trying to do the right thing on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the mission decided at that time to sell that land to a cane farmer the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the moon went down one night the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were put into trucks and taken to the Gorge, an area riddled with hookworm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That land should never have left the control of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Unless a new deal has been made with Holy Joe I would be amazed to find that leasehold area in Cardwell is to be handed back to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not allow a transfer of even a small parcel of land at Ayr so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could set up a caravan park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Gorge, on behalf of Duncan Missionary, the  Chairman  of the committee from that area, on behalf of those who helped him and on behalf of the local housing association I have to tell their side of the story because the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs did not do that in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of his Government he put down his view on the state of Aboriginal affairs but he does not care about what happens to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators on this side of the House believed that when  Senator Chaney  was appointed Minister for Aboriginal Affairs we would see a whole new area of development so far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not done the things that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country hoped he would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was condemned by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a disaster as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the leading <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country, one of theleading men of this country, Charles Perkins, said in no uncertain terms that  Senator Cavanagh,  during his regime as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, was nothing but a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of what  Senator Bonner  may say, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those communities have made it patently clear that they are unhappy with the Queensland Government and all its works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly what we do in the report is to list a series of alternative courses of legislative action in which the Commonwealth could constitutionally engage so as to secure effective self-management rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he make inflammatory statements about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory designed to aggravate farther the already tense situation that exists there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not ABC policy to encourage racial tension and reports on this matter did not incorporate inflammatory statements about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although gastroenteritis is a major problem in young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the precise extent of the problem is unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> constitute only 4 per cent of the Western Australian population under 1 5 years, they accounted for 39 per cent of admissions for gastroenteritis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also highlights the importance of removing sources of infections in lessening the disease problems of young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trachoma is another disease that afflicts <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Trachoma and Eye Health Programme of the Royal Australian College of Opthalmologists has found that WA has the highest trachoma rate of any State for children under 1 1 years- 41 per cent of the 13,018 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This sometimes ends in deafness, lt seems that desert <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> arc free from this symptom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Gwyn Howells, the Director of the Programme, is quoted in the  West Australian  of August 8, 1978, as saying that 23 per cent of all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in WA, South Australia and the Northern Territory who were over 60 were blind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last two years the Federal Government has funded $ 1.75m towards the eradication of trachoma, and more than 100,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been examined and treated where necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may be better than that of the poor in such under-developed countries as Chad or Brazil, but it is entirely unacceptable to people of understanding and goodwill that in this affluent country the governments fail so lamentably to provide the expenditure needed to lift the status of the Aboriginal citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are millions of dollars spent on hospital treatment which a healthier living environment would make unnecessary, but more millions have to be spent on unemployment relief because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not received the training and skills which would qualify them for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to health, much could be done by on site training of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as recommended in the 1978 report on Health by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prevalence of alcoholism among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Ls also a national scandal and tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not infrequently <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are insulted by whites and become the scapegoats of police surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not being given anywhere near the attention by their Government that blacks were getting in South Africa, the rector of a South African university claimed on his return yesterday from an Australian tour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 15 September 1976 the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill 1978 was read a first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this confirm that, in the Council ‘s view, funding cuts in real terms over the past three Budgets have disadvantaged <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We found that the Australian Government Publishing Service was linked with the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many people who are interested in Aboriginal matters and who wonder where we are going with Aboriginal liaison and what we are doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were herded together and this was a situation beyond their experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that we have realised the grave injustice that has been done to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country, in particular to the indigenous inhabitants in those regions of our country where we have discovered a degree of wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have received a shocking deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore say that this tax ought not to be imposed upon <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in order that they may have in peace the paltry amount that they are to receive as only part com.penstion for the injustice their race, their culture and their rights have suffered over the last two centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Galarrwuy  Yunupingu said he wonders why <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the first people to have their compensation payments taxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what happens when the lands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are taken from them or when the acquisition of their land is negotiated under threats and pressures as we have seen this Government act over about the last year in respect of its negotiations with the various Aboriginal land councils in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, having come to those arrangements in respect of the lands in question, some year or so later after negotiating the arrangements which are clearly preferential arrangements and which are of value to the companies concerned, then has the audacity and the termerity to suggest in the National Parliament and that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who in good faith and I submit as a result of some pressure, should be the subject of legislation to tax the payments to be made to them in the form of compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They were substantially the arrangements that were entered into by those who had the authority to make the arrangements with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the areas under the control of the National Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will enable the Commonwealth to recoup these payments from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, lt is also proposed that the provision whereby loans were made available from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund should continue to apply in respect of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the House rose last evening 1 was making the point to the Senate that 1 believe that this legislation is discriminatory insofar as it places a tax on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and as such is at variance with the way in which taxes are levied on other groups in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years we have learnt the degree to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> regard land as their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not think that anyone- not even members of this Government- would suggest that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in the business of selling their land- their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can certainly draw the conclusion- as indeed the Opposition does- that to impose such a tax on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is blantantly discriminatory and racist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is entitled to say that the Bill is not only discriminatory but also racist in its application to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the way in which the Government approaches its responsibilities in regard to tax gathering in this country, one can see that in the area of public morality, this Government is recreant It is open to a great deal of criticism and suspicion because it is setting out to collect sums of money from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are in receipt of royalties arising out of arrangements which have been entered into over the last several years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time those agreements were made there was no suggestion that the royalties to be paid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be taxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While they were being worked out many views were expressed in the community by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until after the arrangements had been entered into on 20 July last year that the Government made public its intentions to tax the royalties paid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there has not been one word of protest by those people who are constantly talking of their concern for the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are at the bottom end of the income scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just look at what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again what I said last night: The reactionary attitude of this Government has been clearly expressed- by its actions, lt has said to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: ‘There is mineral wealth on your land and no matter what you say it is going to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shann Turnbull has pointed out in his report that the Northern Territory as a whole- not just <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- can benefit from the royalties and developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our main concern is the damage being done to Aboriginal culture by the operations of mining in those areas and the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being denied a chance to prepare for the impact of the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had said that it would pay the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> 20 per cent of royalties and tax those royalties, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, through their land councils, would have known about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make no apology for moving the amendment that seeks to have the Bill withdrawn and redrafted in such a way as to take out of the legislation those taxation provisions that are german to it and which would impose a form of taxation upon the royalties paid to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in territories under the control of the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> go out to work for a mining company and derive wages, what their particular groups receive as a result of these royalty payments forms no part of the individuals’ personal incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator should not cry to me on behalf of these big establishments that are allegedly going to lose vast amounts of money through this supposedly generous gesture by these companies to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider his statements recently about the Queensland Government being a tremendous Government because of the deal it did with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Mornington Island and Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubts at all that a deal was made in respect of the royalties that were granted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> about which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to maintain some sort of credibility with the Australian public, I suggest there is a serious case for the reconsideration of this one more infamous Bill that it has brought into both this chamber and the other place for the purpose of downgrading further the social, physical and cultural conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, as so often seems to be the case, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are fair game here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu said he wonders why <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the first people to have their compensation payments taxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the Tact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need help but I cannot think of any shire council, roads board or corporation that does not require help in the planning of its budgets and the allocation of its money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must concede- as certainly we on this side do- that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have suffered as a result of the intrusion of the white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did own the land before the white people came and they accept the proposition that there is need for compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber make the point that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are entitled to compensation for the problems that have been caused by mining and for the social problems they have suffered, upon which I need not elaborate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the basis of payment and the contract that this Government has with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we find that the payment defined in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act has a different meaning from that which might be found in the dictionary, or any artificial meaning to be found in some other Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have experienced heartache in giving up their land to the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think I have mentioned in the Senate before, we found that Aboriginal people do not like being called <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, among other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government’s credibility in this matter of there being an intelligent, reasonable investment by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their own benefit, in which they are consulted carefully over a period of years, is very much at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still think that the Government has made a deal with the mining companies and has told them that it will get money back from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there are more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the inner suburbs of Sydney than anywhere else in Australia.They are trying to get along, trying to be decent, reasonable, honest Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To return to the policy of the Australian Labor Party and the remarks of  Senator Keeffe,  I say that it is not right that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be treated by them as some kind of children, something that has to be protected or treated as a lower order of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has very weak ground on which to do so because in every instance it has supported the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  with the heart of stone, who has decided that the poor, the sick, the children and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country will suffer so that he can make up the deficit in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and its supporters are out to take the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for an economic ride and it does not matter to them as long as they can keep their coffers filled with ill-gotten gains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The company is doing this not for tomorrow or for next year but for years to come so that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have an opportunity to move in and produce teak timber from the forests which have been planted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How much strength has it displayed when it has had to deal with the mavericks in Queensland, who refuse to accept the Federal Government’s authority- not only authority, but indeed obligation- pursuant to the 1967 referendum outcome to be responsible for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She said that it was felt that it was too much trouble to drive <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the city school because of transport costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ultimately this undertaking will become part of a woodchipping project, not for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but merely for the miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Maralinga is not far from the homelands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are likely to walk through that area and perhaps spend fairly long times there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I seek some information about what will happen following the handing down in Queensland yesterday by  Mr Justice  Matthews of a judgment in relation to the payment of award wages to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the various reserves in Queensland and those who live off the reserves and who are covered by the relevant Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1965 Act which operated in Queensland precluded the payment of award wages to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on any reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it precluded <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working away from the reserves from getting the full award rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Act at that time the personal movements of all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were strictly controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A judgment was handed down yesterday in that Industrial Commission following a case that was taken originally at Yarrabah under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another wrangle between the Queensland Government and Canberra over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is looming following an Industrial Court decision that the State does not have power to pay below-award wages to blacks living on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs,  Mr Charles  Porter, said last night the decision would mean that $7.5m would have to be found to pay award wages to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now on the payroll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the regulations under the controversial <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act provide that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working off reserves should be paid award wages, the department interpreted the failure to mention the conditions of blacks on reserves as meaning that award wages did not apply there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government then relied on other sections of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act which invalidated any awards inconsistent with regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that by regulation the governor-in-council has plainly expressed the necessary intention, and the regulation is capable of being, and in my opinion should bc, read as preserving rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed outside a reserve and as a direction to employers other than those who employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because  Mr Justice  Matthews ruled on the question of construction of a Queensland law, he was able to avoid ruling on the application ofthe Commonwealth legislation, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, which was enacted by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made no decision regarding the appropriateness of the Commonwealth ‘s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems ironical that when a project such as this is being carried out which could create employment and provide other advantages for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders there is a great deal of questioning on its validity and whether it will be a success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is creating employment for a number of Torres Strait Islanders and, in some cases, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when it comes to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Torres Strait Islanders, we start to question in this place the whys and the wherefores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has shown itself to be so in respect of its attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was highly critical of the attitude of the people at Lake Nash and he accused the Swift company of wanting to remove ‘all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not actually working on the property, or their immediate families’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was, said  Mr Tuxworth,  a communication problem between the management and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially as  Mr Crumblin  had never visited the camp since his appointment in January, and since neither  Mr Crumblin  nor  Mr Bassingthwaighte  had seen fit to attend this ‘all-party’ conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The management, said  Mr Tuxworth,  was upset at adverse publicity, but had many allegations about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ behaviour, their work attitudes and their dogs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through a translator and the legal advisers, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> repudiated all these allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, I invite the Government to have a look at its performance in the area of constitutional power in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and its performance in relation to the Queensland Government on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1957 the Australian people voted overwhelmingly to give power to this Parliament in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, yet this Government has been prepared, in a defacto sense to trade that power to the Queensland Government so far as Aboriginal reserves in that State are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that the statement not only creates confusion and continues existing confusions, it also raises the very real problem that the Great Barrier Reef will suffer, because of a spineless government, exactly the same fate as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland have suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the plan of the National Park the area that is reserved for the town of Jabiru is described as an area in fee simple within the National Park and outside the area in relation to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were granted land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the same opportunity to enrol and record valid votes in State elections as in Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it does have relevance to other States of Australia, particularly Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective of the conspirators is to deprive, by foul means, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western Australian Liberal Party’s determination to disenfranchise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has grown out of its conviction that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> vote Labor and will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason we have done so is not only the Federal Government’s clear right but also its obligation, pursuant to the 1967 referendum, to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Western Australian Bill ultimately becomes an Act we will expect this Government to accept its obligations to protect the electoral rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am assured that such a Federal Act, providing it referred specifically to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, would invalidate the relevant sections of the State Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asserting that the Commonwealth Government is not accepting its responsibilities pursuant to the 1967 referendum if it fails to protect the electoral rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only two categories of people with whom <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the remote parts of the State are likely to come into contact are justices of the peace and policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they represent authority figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> experience with authority has been an unhappy one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Western Australia to discourage <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from enrolling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will create difficulties in other areas of the State but nowwhere will those difficulties be as intense, or their effects so discriminatory as they will be among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the more isolated parts of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be seen in reports to which I will refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keith Alan Ridge, the successful Liberal Party candidate in the disputed Kimberley election, complained six days later about having to spend the last two weeks of his campaign among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In letters that  Mr Ridge  wrote, he made comments regarding his fears not that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were being manipulated or improperly influenced, but that they were taking advantage of their right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Act is amended in the forseeable future, I would have no intention of standing for election again in Kimberley because I believe that within three years there could be in the order of 4,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the roll and I am sure you would agree we would be fighting a lost cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals know that if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Kimberleys are listed on the elected roll, they will not hold the seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it seems madness that we should have to campaign amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the way that we did and I am hopeful that at some time in the future the Electoral Act will be amended with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties which were experienced on polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can foresee that unless this is done, there could be anything up to 4,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the roll at the next election and, under these circumstances, the Liberal Party would probably be fighting a lost cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That spells out the purpose of the Western Australian amending Bill, which is to deprive the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of their right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of people with whom we are dealing: The member for Pilbara has referred to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the north as ‘savages’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was obvious that the Smith judgment was to find against  Mr Ridge  and against the Liberal Party, the Premier moved to disinfranchise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by means of his notorious 1977 electoral Bill which was subsequently thrown out of Parliament, primarily by the Labor Party but also as a result of a revolt from half the National Country Party,  Mr Dadour,  the Liberal member for Subiaco and, to his credit, the  Speaker  of the Western Australian Assembly,  Mr Ian  Thompson, a Liberal member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the purpose of this motion: The Opposition is seeking an assurance from this Government that, having been given the power and the obligation to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, it at least guarantees- if necessary by an Act of the Federal Parliament pre-empting the Western Australian Act, if and when that is passed- the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to vote at elections in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the same opportunity to enrol and record valid votes in State elections as in Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One finds in that statement, which is recorded in  Hansard,  that not only are we concerned about and mounting these programs with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also that we are mounting quite substantial campaigns to ensure that other groups in the community, in particular ethnic groups, get the necessary information which they require to exercise properly their right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that I will receive further views on the legislation from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he can inform the Parliament of the commencing date for the payment of award wages to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does a committee exist which investigates and advises on the various requirements of houses constructed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; if so: (a) who are the members of the committee; and (b) how many are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Attorney-General: Was a complaint received by the Commissioner for Community Relations from the Winchinam and Burdel groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland that the Queensland Government was acting in breach of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act in refusing the transfer to such groups of land intended to be purchased? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also refer the Minister to a further statement alleged to have been made by  Mr Porter  in the same release wherein certain allegations were made about the resources of his Department to provide adequate housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland being diminished due to the Federal Government diverting funds away from his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were referred to by  Mr Porter  as refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a housing shortage for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as do, I think, each of the States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by reminding him that, by way of questions and correspondence, I have sought from him details of when award wages will be paid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed in the various Queensland communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two Private Members’ Bills are presently before the Senate: the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill 1978 and the Constitution Alteration (Holders of Office of Profit) Bill 1 978, the latter of which has been referred to this Committee for enquiry and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We tried to build up a decent sort of fund for Aboriginal enterprises so that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be able to look after their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Has a person responsible for or associated with Almond Growers, Jaxone and other companies received, or have those companies received, amounts of up to $250,000 from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for the purpose of employing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in growing almonds or in performing other work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been employed, and when, by the companies or associated recipients of that money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs,  Mr Charles  Porter, will visit Europe next month to present what he calls the real facts about Queensland conditions for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would comment that one of the current issues of great debate in the circles in Australia which are interested in the position of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is just where the Aboriginal people did come from when they came to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner in all charity notes that while that may have been the desire and the expressed view of the Australian Government in international, forums- this Government tends to express fascinating views in international forums compared with its performance at home- the sentiment expressed stood in sharp contrast to the actions of the Queensland Government in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on government reserves and Torres Strait Islanders in their home territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keepers ensure protection of the valuable archaeological sites remaining from regular visits by <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> to the island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking to the National Press Club on Wednesday, 10 October, the Chief Minister for the Northern Territory,  Mr Paul  Everingham, suggested that the defence establishment, particularly the engineering and service corps, could provide an enormous boost to Aboriginal communities in the Territory by raising a force of approximately 1,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, principally to educate them in trades et cetera, which would enable them to participate more in local government-type activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have lived in Australia they have regarded land and conservation as one and the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We not only seized the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ lands, their homes, but also massacred the tribes in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The least we can do is to take the steps which are being taken, to consider the matter of the alienation of their lands and to seek to rectify the problem in the areas in which matters still have to be resolved; that is, the areas to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> still lay claim, particularly the areas which we now regard as having tourist and development potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to complain, perhaps not emotionally but rather deeply, about what I believe is happening to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I get the impression- I hope that I am wrong but I do not think that I amthat the intention of the Government is to make sure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get only the crumbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Title can be granted by Aboriginal Land Commissioner insofar as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned and then it can be let back for use by the general public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that when that is prepared it should be a just case in relation to title insofar as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the area are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I can show insofar as the Northern Territory Government and the Queensland Government are concerned that the Federal Government is not prepared to have any confrontation  at all, and the end result of this, of course, is that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the people who suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no suggestion that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want these people to move from that island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Centre Island was given to MIM in spite of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> also wanted it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>West Island, one of the smaller islands, is probably not suitable for the purpose for which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> required it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision had followed circulation of a petition in Alice Springs for termination of the project in favour of building a separate village for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Office of Aboriginal Affairs was established it was agreed among the States that they would keep up their ratio of funding for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amount of money was devoted to housing associations and to other organisations for the building of houses by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It still went to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but in a slightly different way, because we did not trust the State Government with the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its irresponsible mismanagement of the country’s economy, the Labor Government created economic circumstances that deprived many of Queensland’s <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of work opportunities and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the nickname came from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sorry that the Minister has to be at the table tonight because we know that he has no concern for either the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or what might be happening with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, the report did not take into account 13,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders, representing 20 per cent of the State ‘s total indigenous population, who have been rehoused in towns and cities throughout Queensland in the last decade to a thoroughly acceptable community standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a bit like the statement made by  Mr Ellicott  when he told the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they would be better off under a Liberal-National Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were turned off the pastoral properties- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of the pastoralists did not want to have to pay <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the work that they were doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had been exploiting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> perhaps for generations and they did not like the idea of paying for labour which until that time had been relatively free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, he has a long history of work with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria, for instance, he worked with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that one recognises that four years ago the Federal Government purchased Noonkanbah pastoral station for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was purchased by the Federal Government, and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> took it over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of questions were asked which apparently had already been placed on the blackboard to enable the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine the area about which they wanted to speak and to give them some assistance in making any statements they wished to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was the first white man to come to this place to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gets on well with all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, so that means some of the white people must have been complaining about him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that forcing Stan to leave Fitzroy is discrimination because it will make things harder for we <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And also because a small number of whites have made the trouble Tor him, while all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would like to see him stay here with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general secretary of the CSA,  Mr Tony  Black, said today he had been to Fitzroy Crossing to investigate the matter and was satisfied that  Mr Davey’s  transfer would dramatically interfere with the department’s assistance programme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would anticipate that the next election there could be 3000 to 4000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the roll and under such circumstances the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an amendment to the Electoral Act and it will preclude many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from casting a vote in the next State election, on the grounds of illiteracy as much as anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If enough distrust were built up about a police officer of course there would be considerable apprehension on the part of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> about going to him to get assistance to get their names on the electoral roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Wyndham Stan Davey, field research officer for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League, wanted to set up an employment bureau for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> where they could arrange to sell their labour to the stations at the correct price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to stay on at Fitzroy Crossing working with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if I can find a sponsor, but there’s not a lot of work around that pays enough to keep a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they fixed the Electoral Act to make it much more difficult for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enrol, and now they’ve forced Stan Davey to quit because he just might have helped <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to stand up for themselves. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has a person responsible for or associated with Almond Growers, Jaxone and other companies received, or have those companies received, amounts of up to $250,000 from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for the purpose of employing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in growing almonds or in performing other work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been employed, and when, by the companies or associated recipients of that money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government that if we carry that sort of explanation through to its logical extreme we will be charging pensioners for processing their pension applications, we will be charging <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the processing of applications for special assistance that they receive, we will be charging farmers for information from the Department of Primary Industry and from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and we will be charging businessmen for assistance from the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Trade and Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs an article which appeared in the Perth  Daily News  of 22 October 1979 headed ‘Minister Criticizes <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did see the report in the  Daily News  headed ‘Minister Criticizes <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in this group, unfortunately, are alcoholics, epileptics, people suffering from chronic chest and liver diseases, people suffering from venereal diseases, people who are unemployed and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the carriage of the 1967 referendum, the Queensland Government has consistently denigrated and downgraded the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is grave doubt that all of the funds allocated were ever used to provide for the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May 1979 a Conciliation and Arbitration Commission judgment authorised the payment of award wages for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed on Queensland communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to be released from the provisions of the apartheid-like 1971 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their freedom is less than others because of the pre isions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act, the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the regulations and by-laws associated with those two Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement is prepared to negate totally all of the ambitions for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in that State in their claims for land rights, equal wages or award wages- in fact, even in their claims to be recognised as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He did not take any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with him because he did not want to stir up any trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today maintain almost a constantly manned office in London just to tell people in Europe and Britain the way that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are treated in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the claims is that until such time as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders of Queensland are given land rights and equality within the community- until those two rotten Acts are abolished- they will never be free and there will never be happiness amongst the Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want to set up a caravan park there, so that a few of them can make a living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter whether it is the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia who want political and land rights or the people in Timor, Namibia, Rhodesia or South Africa; it is part of the pattern of people struggling for the right to determine their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because the majority of Queenslanders and Australians are becoming increasingly fed up with the ‘sit down’ money paid by the Commonwealth to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in the Northern Territory, and the wasteful pouring of torrents of public funds into the bottomless pits of impracticalities and failed projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has commented at various forums on the conditions of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it has commented about what are alleged to be the brutalities and denials of civil rights by the United <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was challenged by a Tass correspondent as to how I would react if a committee of the Soviet Parliament were to inquire into Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reaction is that I would be delighted if a committee of the Soviet Parliament, or of any other parliament, were to inquire into the situation of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The worst offenders currently are Queensland and Western Australia with their laws and practices relating to voting, public assembly, criminal investigation, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, perhaps one can also add, industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deeply offended by the tenor of John Singleton’s article A Happy Story About <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ the Bulletin 13 November 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deeply offended by tenor of the Bulletin’s articles 9 October, 13 November 1979 “The Real Story Behind Western Australia’s Race Riots’ and ‘A Happy Story About <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the land rights legislation was manipulated by the uranium mining companies to reach an agreement which was less than fair to most of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the uranium provinces of the Northern Territory garrulous statements were made by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber about what a fair deal it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that even if we had freedom of information legislation similar to that in America it would enable people- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and negotiating parties- to gain access to information such as that contained in these documents, which never sees the light of day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aggrieved parties are most frequently <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or members of other oppressed groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was the 1 978 report which referred in particular to the many acts of discrimination which are suffered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other minority groups in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made an analysis of the apartheid-like Acts to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland are subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Racial prejudice and discrimination particularly affect the lives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other coloured groups but ethnic groups also are victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland and his Ministers were able to prevent that from happening purely and simply on the ground that the people involved were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In lots of cases in my State it occurs as a result of the discriminatory provisions of the Queensland Government’s Acts and policies, particularly under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot have in one’s own country a standard that one cannot apply on a world wide scale, and it is those sorts of philosophies that prompt the Labor Party from time to time to take the Government to task about its inability to solve the problem ‘s of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our two way-out States of Western Australia and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While we were there we met a deputation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia for many years- for the 200 years that we have been on this continent- has been a national disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are still not satisfied with the way in which this Government has approached the problem in Queensland, particularly in relation to Aurukun and Mornington Island, or that the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there have been properly recognised and the obligations of the Federal Government accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is because the Government has not been prepared to take on the Queensland Government whose attitude towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is one to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From  Senator Bonner’s  contribution this afternoon we know the extent to which police persecute <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know how electoral laws in Western Australia are designed principally to discriminate against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is under State laws that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are discriminated against and it is under State laws that there is discrimination against women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know, if we know anything of the way officialdom has dealt with the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the back-blocks of Australia, that the person at the level of making the decision is the one who often practices the discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western Australian electoral Act changes will make it very difficult for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants to cast valid votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to supersede certain provisions of the laws of Queensland that discriminate against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and deny them basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should as soon as possible extend by legislation the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After a long and arduous struggle the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have finally achieved control to a greater or lesser extent over the remaining lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is a need for the Parliament to join forces with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the purpose of protecting their achievements in their struggle for the fundamental principles of land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland we have witnessed numerous blatant exercises by self-interested groups and land grabs by aluminium companies which are ably assisted by a very oppressive and racist government which, when it comes to the question of whose rights have to be recognised, seems invariably to go against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have witnessed similar difficulties in Western Australia and have also witnessed, unfortunately, the disenfranchisement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the systematic denial of their democratic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Charles  Court and his Government under the guise of trying to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not open to manipulation have taken the step- I would hope a desperate and unsuccessful attempt- of trying to deny <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> their basic fundamental right of being enrolled and participating in parliamentary elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has already led to a number of attempts by that Government to try to place obstacles in the way of enrolment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western Australian Minister for Health and Community Welfare,  Mr Ridge,  who holds the seat of Kimberley, has admitted in a Western Australian newspaper that the Liberal Party devised and executed a plan deliberately aimed at denying <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Kimberleys an effective vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that he had to campaign amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the extent that he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a Minister of the Crown to find it degrading to mix with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are, after all, his voters and constituents seems to me to be related to the problems we were discussing yesterday on the racial discrimination and human rights legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ridge concluded in a shameful display of a callous politicking with the claim that if changes to the Act were not made there could be 3,000 to 4,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the roll by the next election, in which case, I quote him, the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Court government is attempting to use the relative lack of English verbal ability possessed by Western Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to disenfranchise them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed amendments will at best create difficulties for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wishing to vote in State elections and at worst disenfranchise illiterate Aboriginals wishing to register a postal vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Aurukun and Mornington Island have been denied self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the Minister extra leeway in blocking the transfer of tribal lands to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition suggests- I would have thought that the Parliament had determined this-that the Council is responsible to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not to the Minister or to the Government; it is responsible for protecting the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 provides for the granting of Commonwealth money to non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> appearing before the Council- that is, the land owners who took the land in the first place and the mining companies which now want uninterrupted access if they feel there are assets there that ought to be exploited and if, in the considered opinion of the government of the day, it is considered to be in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is concerned that the interpretation of national interest could well have an objective which would place the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a somewhat different, discriminatory and disadvantaged position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case- that is the way the Opposition reads the legislation- it seems to be in line with the Government’s aim to prevent any possible impediment to the views that have been expressed openly in a publication by the Australian Mining Industry Council and in other magazines, which seems to indicate that they have set about to weaken the legislation and to vest more power in a development-minded Government to deprive <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the rights that were originally contemplated in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition expects that the Minister will give some reasons why he believes that there has to be a public inquiry- I suppose that is what one would say about the appointment of  Mr Rowland-  into the difficulties in connection with the conversion of land leases on land held by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would like some assurance from the Minister that when these sorts of conflicts of interest manifest themselves, the Government will back an objective look at the matter and recognise our commitment to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not our commitment to multinational mining companies, many of which are foreign owned and have shown in a historical sense all over the world that they are interested in development for their short term purposes and that they have not really appreciated the damage that they have done to the environment in various countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, the Opposition is concerned that the mentality or philosophy that seems to be characteristic of mining companies is seen in a proper perspective, having regard to our fundamental commitment and obligation to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister has had a chance to examine what the amendment now seeks to do he will see that it seeks to extend the legislation to include <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think, therefore, that rather than leave the matter in the hands of the Minister for the Capital Territory, it ought to come within the province of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs so that he can take on board the proposition that at some future stage the Government should introduce legislation which would extend at least the Northern Territory Aboriginal land rights legislation, with all its weaknesses that I have referred to, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should as soon as possible extend by legislation the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian Capital Territory ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The insinuation there, I think, is once again that, as I am always complaining, too many people are speaking on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On at least 25 of those occasions divisions were called, and if the Minister does not believe what I am saying he may refer in  Hansard  to each of the 25 divisions where he will see his name in black and white when he said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may not get this, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may not get that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the whole purpose of this amending legislation is to further restrict <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their lawful search for justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to read the whole document, if the Minister is worried about it, but the message from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was done deliberately to exclude <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from putting in land rights claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act gives <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> power to veto the project because pan of the land needed by the company is subject to a claim by the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following on the report of Justice Fox on the Ranger  Uranium  Environmental Inquiry the Government embodied in legislation the proviso that if a mining interest had been applied for before June 1976 on land which subsequently became Aboriginal land then <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could not prevent uranium mining but could merely negotiate terms and conditions of that mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For while it seems to be generally accepted that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will win the land claim there are a number of other technical but critical processes are to be undergone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There again, in view of the impending over-supply situation for uranium oxide, from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves and owners of this land, the Government must assure itself very definitely that there is going to be a financial reward in proceeding with mining at Jabiluka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing we want in maintaining faith in the land rights area is to tell the Northern Land Council that there is a tremendous bonanza for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there and then find in a few years’ time that we have made a great big hole in the ground, there is a hell of a mess, we have a bankrupt company which can no longer come and fix the damage and they have just got to live with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason -we know what the reason is- the suggestion is made that pastoral properties managed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not being run properly; that the rest of Australia will suffer as a result of these people in the Northern Territory being given pastoral properties to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a principle about which we know there has been considerable pressure and considerable disputation, as the Minister rightly referred to, between the original land owners- here I am referring to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- and those who claimed to be the original land owners- and here I am referring to the whites- because of the way in which the early land titles were dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in those circumstances the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would win out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Nabarlek the company does not directly employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but it has proposed the establishment of a company to give contracts to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> much along the lines of what happened at Gove. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fairly obviously because the Federal Government has abrogated its responsibility to the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has reneged on its condition of self-government that it would retain responsibility for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That condition was welcomed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had justifiable doubts about their treatment under a Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health care problems among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are still as acute as ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  also is creating employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through the Community Development Employment Project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call upon those responsible for the spending of taxpayers’ money on this ‘Have a go, Australia’ promotion to either give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other groups their fair place in any representation of the Australian community or cease such promotion campaign altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now knows as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators and in accordance with an undertaking given by the Minister for Trade and Resources in the House of Representatives on 2 1 August 1 979, 1 present a report by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of uranium mining on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-73">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What seems to flow from this particular report is a confirmation of the concern that has been expressed by the Opposition during the whole period of negotiations with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since the commencement of land rights and the acquisiton of land in the Territory for the purpose of mining, the Opposition has warned the Government on many occasions- as have many other groups in the Australian communityabout social impact and the destruction of the social life of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a result of this mammoth investment by mining groups in our country, and in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has certainly borne out the concern which has been expressed from time to time about the impact that this situation will have on the life and the environment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the statement, following the report from the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, is an admission that in fact there has not been sufficient surveillance, understanding, or administration of the way in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been affected by mining activities in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said and Government reports have shown- as this report now confirms- that interference with the normal life style and life pattern of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area is a matter which has not been properly understood by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the time when  Mr Viner  was hell bent, as I would put it, on stampeding the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area to agree to the Government’s proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was abundant evidence in subsequent debates in the Parliament, particularly in the Senate, when we were able to show that  Mr Viner  was in fact forcing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to accept Government proposals and forcing them, because of his own persuasive powers, ability, capacity and public position, to accept standards which they did not understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said then that if the Government had a proper understanding of the difficulties that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had in comprehending what the Government was about, that if it had some compassion about what effect this move would have on the life style of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that if it had some understanding that it was attempting to impose a white form of administration, or a European type of administration on the Territory, then it would understand that this matter needed to go through the process of a time scale or a discussion, which should be done in an atmosphere of complete understanding so that each and every Aborigine understood what was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also emphasised this matter when we talked about the Government’s haste and in particular  Mr Viner’s  haste and the haste of the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony),  in imposing the will of this Government on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in an atmosphere which made it impossible for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to comprehend the effects of those negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice that we preferred to the Government at that time was that the Government should take extraordinary steps to provide the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the concepts of what that would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Minister for tabling the report of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, because I think the debates in this Parliament over the last three or four years have at least drawn to the attention of some members of the Government the need to act more vigilantly, to consider their responsibilities afresh, and to re-examine what has happened with a view to taking the sorts of steps in the future that would elevate the protection of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to a major principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the most incredible part of the summary made by the Minister of the report is that now there is recognition that we have to take extraordinary steps to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but not in any paternalistic way by saying that they do not understand and therefore we need to act on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue is providing them with the information, structures and means by which the decisions that are to be made are of such character that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can make a value judgment based on all the facts and not just the financial remuneration that flows from their changed status as land holders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own education in this area has been assisted by his compassionate approach to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- I wish to make a brief statement on this report about the social impact of uranium mining on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact of the matter is that the actual overall expenditure by the Government on legal aid- this does not include legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it is only legal aid provided through the AttorneyGeneral ‘s Department- has been as follows: In 1976-77, under the first Budget of the present Government, $18,125,000; in 1977-78, $20,177,000; and in 1978-79, $21,989,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adult franchise as it has applied for all other Australian-born citizens, at least for the lower houses of our Parliaments, has never existed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes discrimination was oven- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had to be granted citizen rights before they could enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even now under Commonwealth law and the law of most States <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, though entitled to enrol and vote, are not compelled to do so as are other native-born or naturalised Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even without deliberate legal impediments, the economic and cultural gap between many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the mainstream of Australian society imposes a barrier between them and the effective use of the franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill applies only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not because we are indifferent to these other groups, but because the only Commonwealth power relevant in this context, is a restricted powerrestricted that is to make laws pertaining to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent amendments to the Electoral Act of Western Australia impose more restrictive enrolment procedures than those of the Commonwealth or any other State with which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> especially will have problems in complying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to exempt <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from complying with these restrictive procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will require the State electoral registrar in Western Australia to enrol all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are on the Commonwealth roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective was to prevent <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from recording votes, or if that failed, from recording valid votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numerous allegations were made by Western Australian Government members that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been manipulated by Ernie Bridge or his supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that fact, the State Government proceeded with a program based on the assertion that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were being manipulated and that irregularities were rife in postal voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So discriminatory against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were these amendments that they were opposed in the Legislative Assembly not only by the Labor Opposition, but by half the Country Party, and a Liberal backbencher, and were defeated by the casting vote of the Liberal  Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially those living in remote areas like the Kimberleys, it is a major deterrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no overstatement to say the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are apprehensive about approaching people in these positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can foresee that unless this is done, there could be anything up to 4,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the roll at the next election and, under these circumstances, the Liberal Party would probably be fighting a lost cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether  Mr Ridge’s  hope provided the motive for the Western Australian Government decision to impose more stringent enrolment procedures which would apply with special force to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, clause 8 of the Government Electoral Amendment Bill will have that effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It effectively ensures that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have complied with Commonwealth Electoral Act procedures will be included in the State roll for the appropriate district and province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the same opportunity to enrol and vote in State Elections as in Federal Elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, apart from the general support he expressed on behalf of the Government, he pointed out that all disadvantaged people- and most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are disadvantaged- being without other power, have a special interest in the political power conferred by the franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to refer first of all to what I believe to be a matter of national importance for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have noted also that the Mayor of Mt Isa attributed the increase in the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Mt Isa and Cunnamulla particularly to the decline in the cattle industry in outlying areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-52-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our main objective in the course of this inquiry and in preparing this report has been to shed some light on some hitherto obscure aspects of the debate concerning the appropriate means of discharging the Commonwealth’s obligations to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>But in assessing the effectiveness of that legislation we have reached firm conclusions as to the scope of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the extent and variety of powers in respect to the acquisition of property and the constitutional requirements to provide ‘just terms’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></li>
