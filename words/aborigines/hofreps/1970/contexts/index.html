  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, were any feasibility studies carried out by any section of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs to determine whether this property could be developed as (a) a viable property which could be successfully worked or (b) a training area for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in pastoral industry requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My Office is awaiting the views of the South Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs as to whether Mount Arden would have value as a training school for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in pastoral requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-48-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This allocation meant that the Aboriginal houses lacked laundries and sewerage, something which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> apparently can do without. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the end of 1974, I think, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefit Trust Fund will have a total of $4m with an annual income of Sim, so there is quite a lot of money which will be available for future projects many of which can be run by Aboriginals who are learning to manage the projects themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the basic recommendations was that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Board should be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiries and investigations of the committee indicated that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Board in New South Wales had not fulfilled its function and had not done the job that it was hoped it would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was coincidental that at about the time the report of this all party joint committee was presented to the Parliament the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Board embarked on some improvement projects - and I am speaking from only personal experience here– at least in one quarter of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, there came the time when the Parliament of New South Wales in its wisdom implemented the report of the select committee and said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Board, should be dissolved and its functions taken over by the various departments of State that were charged with the care and responsibility and welfare of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in due course it was decided by the Government of New South Wales that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Welfare Board would cease its operations and would be in fact dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (3)  Dr Eggleston’s  findings cannot, I believe, be said to indicate gross discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in law enforcement in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some instances of discrimination on the grounds of race are cited and 1 certainly see these are a matter for concern; but the study also indicates some aspect in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> find themselves in a favoured position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Eggleston’s  general conclusion is that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in common with other people of low social and economic status, are in various ways severely disadvantaged in dealings with the legal and judicial system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the most common charge against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was drunkenness, whereas traffic offences represent more than half the charges against non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and that prison sentences  are  more often imposed for drunkenness than for traffic offences; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (5) The Office of Aboriginal Affairs has been able to advise on police training courses in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and officers have given talks at police colleges to develop a greater understanding of the special problems of Aboriginal people in relation to the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the attitudes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to normal concepts of hygiene, the implications of the life style which most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> choose to follow and the absence of family planning leading to the inadequate spacing of children are significant contributing factors to the Infant Mortality Rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not unusual, however, for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to choose European names which they use in conjunction with a subsection name and a mother will usually choose a European name for her child for birth registration purposes; nursing sisters frequently assist the mother in this by providing a panel of names from which she may choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beyond the statutory school leaving age, we are very encouraged by the response to the secondary and study grants schemes, which, as honourable members will bc aware, help make it possible for young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to pursue their studies as far as they are capable of proceeding with substantial benefit to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that very many more young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are now staying on in secondary school and that there has been generally a marked improvement in the attitudes and application of the children and in their level of attainment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has also provided amounts in the votes of other Commonwealth departments, such as the $154,000 in the votes of the Department of Labour and National Service for the continuation of the employment training scheme conducted by that Department - which is, I believe, already having an important effect in increasing permanent employment of young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By investing sufficient money in the right areas over the years immediately ahead we will be making it possible for increasing numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become independent of the special assistance now being provided through the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account and in other ways, and, where they need assistance, to be progressively cared for by the general provisions made for the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in this regard in an observation made a few weeks ago by the Premier of Queensland when talking about the difficulties which he and his Government face in recruiting sufficient people to work in the field of welfare for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, lt has often seemed to me that those who demonstrate, whatever the form of demonstration, might well look to more beneficial and fruitful form in displaying their concern than simply to seek publicity, whatever the form of search might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The scheme cannot possibly work in relation to <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They were formerly provided for by a Government grant of about $20,000 a year made to doctors to care for the health of <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that now there are fewer than 1,000 <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any family with at least one dependant with a taxable income below $1,730 would be automatically exempted from contributing but would have full access for free public or standard ward hospital treatment and for medical services from a private doctor of the patient’s choosing, Importantly, those most luckless of all Australians - the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - would be fully covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the honourable member for Bendigo referred to a scheme in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the scheme in Western Australia that Government gave the AMA 9,000 a year to provide free services for fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the south-west of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of a year the doctors would total the amounts owing to them by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, as I said, the return on fees owing was about 35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be all right as the Federal Government would make them members of medical funds, but it did not work out that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AMA contacted the State Government and the State Government contacted the Department of Social Services and the Department of Health in Canberra stating that it was not working and with the request that the Commonwealth continue to subsidise Western Australia under the scheme whereby it provided medical services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth said: ‘Oh no, the scheme was never intended to cover these people because some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might be earning too much and they would not come within the provisions of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, what I have in mind was illustrated by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  a few days ago when he was asked a question about the $7m proposed for the establishment of a national film and television school to educate actors, television producers and the like which had been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth - The Honourable Peter Howson, M.P., Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and I preface it by referring to a statement issued by the Minister for the Interior in which he referred to the establishment of an advisory council on the projected use of Commonwealth land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take the matter a stage further, within recent weeks I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and I have pointed out to him that he is to proceed as quickly as possible to collect all the evidence that becomes available to him so that the proposal can be presented to the Government well before the next Budget and not necessarily therefore in a budget context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the aged and those who are presently feeling the squeeze of the rural depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Downing, the  Chairman  of the Ministers Fraternal at Alice Springs, in which he recommended to me that we should purchase a property in order to look after the young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could talk at length about the health needs of the aged, the low income families, migrants and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, yet of all these groups it is difficult to speak effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  that we have an opportunity here to do likewise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been variously told by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  firstly, that in 12 months time consideration will be given to the recommendations made by the interim council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the question that 1 put to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  this afternoon, I asked specifically had he had any communication from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure does not mean that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are 340 times more lawless than is the non-Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can mean, as I think it does mean, that there is discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the enforcement of Australia’s criminal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I asked the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  the following question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to census figures, the total population of South Australia was 1,079,380 and there were 5,505 full blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - full blood, mind you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here the study revealed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> comprised only 2.5 per cent of the general population yet accounted for 25 per cent of all prisoners and 11 per cent of all criminal convictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The supposition that there is discrimination between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and whites in the administration of justice has been tested by several academics and by the Opposition’s Aboriginal Affairs Committee, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offences such as drunkenness affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; attitudes of individual police were significant, affecting for example the decision whether to prosecute where Aboriginal people were involved; white people found under the influence were less likely to be arrested than were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were less likely to be granted bail than whites; poverty was often’ the reason an Aborigine was not released on bail; poverty and lack of education resulted in many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not obtaining legal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every category of offence the percentage of those charged receiving prison sentences was higher among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the Budget estimates for the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see that most States have set up ministries of the environment and that they are co-operating with the Federal Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These organisations are taking a very active interest in dealing with this problem which comes under the control of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the estimates now before the Committee, I intend to confine my remarks to a subject which in my opinion is receiving very little, if any, real attention from the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the urgent requirement to improve substantially what in many areas at the moment can only be described as the deplorable and disgusting conditions in which many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are expected to exist - conditions which in turn are largely responsible for the high mortality rate among infant children, for the dreaded disease of leprosy and for several other ills and complaints from which so many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I see it the initial responsibility lies with the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She worked an area around Fitzroy Crossing where there was a population of some 700 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the United <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Mission school where the children were housed in dormitories and had regular balanced meals, fruit and vegetables, and their own towels and face washers, there was an approximately 80 per cent cure, which shows what proper living conditions can mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts is surely the department which must take the initiative even though it will have to obtain the co-operation and assistance of those other departments to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The eradication of leprosy amongst Aboriginal people of Australia is seen by the Commonwealth as being within the framework of the general improvement of the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time no specific survey into the health problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, either on an Australiawide basis or in Aboriginal communities and fringe settlements, is under consideration by the Department of Health and Office of Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, who is at the table, notwithstanding that his interest seems to be very little, will give us some satisfactory explanation of the contradiction that exists between those 2 replies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I wish to refer to the inept title of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and MinisterinCharge of Tourist Activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not, of course, responsible for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, where the Commonwealth has the greatest control and where most of them are located: where the emergence from tribalised society can best be studied and where the mistakes of the past can best be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All logic requires that he should be responsible for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not deal at length with the environment and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> beyond saying in the context of my particular thesis - the development of an Australian identity - that nothing could redound more to the advantage of our national image than, firstly, that we should succeed in dealing humanely and intelligently with the problem of promoting the happiness of and establishing a satisfactory relationship with our Aboriginals - ‘the first Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This evening we are devoting our attention to the estimates for the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and we all recognise that some very thoughtful speeches have been made on both sides of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is a new Department which when it was set up came under some criticism as being a miscellaneous sort of department, there is no doubt that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has under his control some very important facets of the national life and some very important responsibilities that the Commonwealth has to meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders may be allocated Housing Commission homes, but by and large it is Government money which builds houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whereas among what might be called the white Australian community people have a choice between being assisted by savings banks, home building societies of various kinds and, of course, housing commissions also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in a number of environments on government settlements and missions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who work in the pastoral industry and who are fringe dwellers either around cattle stations or around the country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the expenditure of Commonwealth money and where it is being spent we find that it is spent mainly on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in towns, and that the largest amounts of money spent have been on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> other than those living in a fringe dwelling environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whom we might describe as urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the organisations working for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the large country towns and in the cities have received grants from the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the impact which needs to be made in an area which has not yet been touched on is in relation to the housing of urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted in the documents distributed by the Minister recently that one house was built in the City of Brisbane, for example, for the housing of urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say that when we look about our cities and see <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their housing our attention tends to be drawn to those places where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are perhaps living in overcrowded conditions or in substandard housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in these circumstances are obviously easier to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not detracting in any way from the fact that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our cities and towns are living in very satisfactory circumstances, but the problem still remains and it is a problem that we have yet to face up to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area in which it should not be difficult to make an assessment of what the needs are, not only to provide new houses for the expanding population but also to ensure that those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are shifting into our cities and towns are satisfactorily housed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s inference was that because of these assumed correct, but incorrect assumptions, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Napperby station are not receiving sympathy and consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point is that in excess of 3,000 antibiotic tablets were sent to the station to be distributed to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Shepherd  personally distributed those tablets S times a day to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were on the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Did the right honourable member for Higgins last night assert that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts had given the House figures which were not accurate and estimates which were misleading on the national film and television training school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did listen in on the intercommunication system last night to the speech made by the right honourable gentleman from Higgins and I heard that part of it relating to the figures that had been presented to the House by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I can say is that if anyone knew the full story relating to the VIP incident, rather than being critical of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, he would say that he took upon himself an enormous responsibility when there was no need for him to have taken any responsibility whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My  Deputy Chairman,  in speaking to the estimates for the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, which cover, of course, matters relating to Aboriginal affairs, tourism and the arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that he is one of few who happen to be working with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want particularly to draw the attention of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to a unique area called Hallett Cove in my electorate in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before we have the areas in which this development can take place; we now have a Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts; the Minister for the Environment  (Mr Howson)  is currently the Minister at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we will not get anywhere until the Commonwealth does something like this as far as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Victoria have very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as part of their national responsibility, but the actual financial and social responsibility lies as squarely upon the people of Coburg, whom I represent, as it does upon the people of Cloncurry whom the honourable member for Kennedy misrepresents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders live in substandard dwellings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those who believe that housing is one of the fundamental solutions to the problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on the edges of most Australian towns and cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, to take the bit between his teeth in these matters and challenge the State authorities on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of health, for instance, as I understand it, the highest infant mortality rate in the world is found amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in some areas of the Northern Territory, and the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> attending university is extremely low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the time available to me I intend, naturally, to concern myself with Aboriginal welfare and with the way in which Aboriginals will benefit this year from the estimates of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just listened to the honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  giving his once a year, or is it once a session, expression of concern for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having visited the Aboriginal settlements and missions in central Australia in the last 10 days, the only point 1 would like to make is that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not impressed by either him or the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was working last week in an area where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live, the votes from only one ballot box in the Legislative Council election had been counted, and the colleague of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, representing the Country Party had received 39 votes and the Australian Labor Party candidate had received 152 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I visited central Australia I was impressed by the many people who worked for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and by the shocking conditions under which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in central Australia it was 89 per 1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No!hing I say now is intended to reflect on either the sincerity or the integrity of the people who are working there with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts certainly has to think about these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Papunya we have some 800 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from different tribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that people in Australian in 1971 would not believe the conditions under which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I probably could not find a group of more concerned people or more with-it people than I found at Hermannsburg running that mission and trying to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there, whether they were there as teachers, nurses or in some other capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Santa Teresa we have 600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no political education and no attempt is made to encourage <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to look after themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to fling a lot of cheap criticism at the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  who is sitting at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who moves around areas where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are will find that there seems to be a bit of a clash in regard to responsibility, a clash as to who is responsible for providing this and who is responsible for providing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate of Grey I suppose I have a greater number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than there are in any other South Australian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the north west area reserve is the same as the problem existing just over the border in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is an obvious need for a health education programme - different from the health education given by these officers - under officers who can move through these areas and spend more time helping the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to overcome the hygiene and health problems that do occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in that area I spoke to quite a few of the people involved with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be said that the Ernabella people are running this successfully and by doing so are providing something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed in other areas where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are that there is a great need for preschool kindergartens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all aware that even in an area like Port Augusta where there are quite a number of educated and sophisticated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, most Aboriginal children because of their background and their parents lack of education start off at school behind white children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to move further south to the Port Augusta area and deal with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the southern part of my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, Whyalla is an expanding town and there is a demand for labour but there is very little housing available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way we would make possible a lot more employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Whyalla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not nearly enough work for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and this means that they are drifting more towards towns like Port Augusta and Whyalla and this again creates unemployment problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make a few remarks in the debate on the estimates for the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts mainly because of events that have taken place in the last few days in my electorate of Bowman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But frustrations have been thrust on her by the Government and by the Department administered by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  who sits at the table this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a most interesting time to see that all the facets of the Department - environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts - have come under scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the Commonwealth, overall responsibility for the arts has been placed by me with the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They continue to this day and now advise the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Prime Minister tonight could have taken the opportunity to clear the air of assertions made by the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  in this House that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  had been inaccurate and misleading in information he had supplied to the House - a squalid performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 14th October, in reply to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, I undertook to look at figures concerning the proposals of the Interim Council for a National Film and Television Training School that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  had presented to the House and at criticisms that had been made about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A copy oi a Idler  dated 28th  July 1971 from the  Chairman  to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They claim that we have dispossessed the Aboriginal of his land, of his birthright, and that our general attitude is to treat <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as second rate citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has that Committee recommended that land should be granted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> only when in the opinion of the Government it will be put to economic use, and then only on a leasehold basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is also directed to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts assure the House that the inquiry into the role of the crafts as an art form, which was announced by the Prime Minister 2 nights ago, will not entail any interruption of or reduction in the programme of support for craft activity currently being carried on by the Craft Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday and today I have heard speeches - particularly from the members of the Country Party - which have been an insult to every person in Australia who does not happen to have a white skin; and there are 100,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to start with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one moves down the list a little one will find that the appropriation for the employment training scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> amounts -to $154,000 as against the expenditure of $94,932 last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that an amount of almost $3.2m has been allocated for the maintenance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Government settlements and that an increased amount of $4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was stated that there would be a meeting of officials of the Department of the Interior, the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday, 26th October last, 1 spoke on the estimates of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point that I have visited the Northern Territory and that I have seen <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were living like animals at Papunya. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Prospect raised the question of the administration of the health facilities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say something about the whole question of Aboriginal advancement in the Northern Territory because more questions are being asked today than ever before about what the Government is doing for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This interest is a very welcome sign that the community generally is becoming more aware of our responsibility to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to overcome the disadvantages they suffer in comparison with the general community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The closer interest shown by people in the situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is reflected in the increasing expenditures allocated specifically for the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The works programme for this year also includes a number of significant projects which will assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than 22,000 full-blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live permanently on government settlements and on mission stations but a significant number of about 4,000 continue to reside on pastoral properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a great problem in formulating positive action to help those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on pastoral properties to live more productive lives at a reasonable standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My predecessor in this portfolio, who is now the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Nixon),  appointed a committee to look at the situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on pastoral properties to see what might be done to improve their social and economic standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People often comment that the Government has established settlements for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in places where there is little opportunity for the sort of economic development necessary to sustain a permanent community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases a settlement is located at a particular place because there were large numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> residing permanently in the general area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some years at least the main work of social, educational and economic advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will necessarily have to be done within existing settlements and missions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To conclude, I just want to mention one problem referring to the situation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on the fringes of towns such as Katherine and Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> visit Alice Springs, and in the absence of any suitable facilities camp at various places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given unlimited funds and unlimited physical resources a great deal more could no doubt be done to improve the living standards of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become permanent mendicants; the Aboriginal people do not want this either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real solution seems to be the provision pf balanced programmes of assistance which will give a real opportunity to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to exercise the same responsibilities in personal matters as is accepted by the general community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask a question of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates for this Department are divided into  10  separate divisions, even after the hiving off of a number of divisions to the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in it are people like the present Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who was going to revolutionise the situation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he give details of (a) Federal and (b) State government actions which, since Federation, have (i) increased and (ii) decreased the size of Aboriginal reserves in Australia, including in the answer the dates of the actions, the amendments to areas of reserves and a note on whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rights on resrved land were restricted in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-35-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the New South Wales Police Commissioner reported that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who comprise only about 1 per cent of the population, represent about 40 per cent of some 15,000 persons in New South Wales convicted for drunkenness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This particular letter was in the possession of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  and the Cabinet when they met on 25th October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst I fully realise that this matter is one that concerns mainly the Department of Civil Aviation it is also one that is, or should be, of the utmost importance to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having regard to this clear charter given to the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts I confidently expected that during the recent debate on the Estimates for his Department the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts would have grasped the opportunity further to restate his charter, particularly that section that directs him to intervene when the activities of any other Commonwealth department will cause added pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will be aware that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts said in answer to a question on Aboriginal land rights addressed to him on 9th November by the honourable member for Prospect that the matter was one for an announcement by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There have been many meetings of a ministerial kind to discuss and make decisions about the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a whole and I think we have now got to the position where with one exception, and that is associated with land rights, all outstanding problems have been decided and I believe they have been decided to the satisfaction of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Premier of Western Australia has asked for $10m to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, no matter where it might be, is far from adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the House the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Reid which advocates special consideration for the housing needs of pensioners, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, deserted wives and similarly disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his amendment, the honourable member for Reid has made special mention of lower income earners, pensioners, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, deserted wives and similar disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where is the concern of the Government shown for the low income earners, the pensioners, the migrants, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the deserted wives and the similarly disadvantaged people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also there is an extensive scheme to develop housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.. 1. understand that some thousands of units have been built under this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister, before establishing a group of Ministers chaired by the Treasurer to handle the matter of the national film and television training school, advise the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Aru of his intention to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is sitting at the table, to study and consider the way in which the money has been allocated, particularly in respect of how much has been Spent on Cape Barren Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spend a good deal of time discussing the problems confronting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> both with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and with the people who are concerned with their welfare, such as welfare workers and child welfare officers.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment; <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  made mention in his second reading speech of the fact that direct national expenditure on Aboriginal advancement for 1971-72 will be $44m for an estimated Aboriginal population of 140,000.It could be said that the Government has shown some consideration for the Aboriginal problem on that score alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we leading the main body of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of their predicament or are we just skimming the cream off the top of the problem and making things much more comfortable only for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have really advanced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The homes that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living in are well kept and the gardens look better than those of the Europeans next door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one wonders whether we are really getting hold of the main problem of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T have been told of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my electorate moving info homes and after a short period they become unemployed and they move out again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important factor in lifting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> up as group and having them all working was the drought relief work for the western division of New South Wales up around Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they were all working on drought relief it was noticeable that the drunkenness amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reduced, absenteeism was just about nil and their general health standard rose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we must concentrate more on finding more regular employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people in these isolated areas are finding it very bard io educate their children and they arc conscious of the assistance being given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have to be very careful how we give them this assistance, lt will not assist the assimilation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if we cause some kind of hard feeling amongst the people in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a fair amount of talk in this House at various times about the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but I think we have to agree that there is a great need to concen-tra te a little more on the education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also be concentrating on educating the Europeans about the Aboriginal problem because I feel that it is in this area that a lot of harm has been done to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for our educators to attack the ignorance of the average Australian about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>School curricula should include sections which explain how the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lived before the European invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should give some idea of the difficulties that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are facing in adapting to our technological environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is well known that a good percentage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> leave school at an early age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People go so far as to say that we will never make a great deal of progress in educating tha <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not making progress as a group we have to look to our own faults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these faults was our treatment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> shortly after we came to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the statement made by the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  that separate statistics for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were hard to find is true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one occasion when I was touring with the Labor Party’s Aboriginal committee we were informed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a particular area that a large percentage of them were arrested each day for drunkenness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can you tell us how many whites and how many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were arrested?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On examining them we could not tell which was an Aboriginal name and which was not, but on asking someone who did know the area we found that they were all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were informed by the police that they did get drunk but when they were spoken to by the police they would go home but the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> gave a bit of check and were arrested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not a knocker of the police because in a good many areas they have to be very considerate people, but I think that point clearly illustrates what is happening to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something along these lines should be done and it would not cost the Government very much, it might make a great deal of difference to the lot of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are crying out for guidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be achieved only by a consideration of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ own thoughts and desires in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to find a way to get to know the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to get the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to take positive action to cope with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It- seems to me that we have to build in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> some- vision and some hope for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister should take into consideration that many people are concerning themselves With the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the figures made available by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  there has been an increase from $3,650,000 in 1968-69 to $9,200,000 for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those people who move around the areas where there are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will know that this is certainly not enough because not a great deal of progress is being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that housing is one of the 4 major items of concern with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are still in a tribal state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the southern part of South Australia the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly in the towns, are sometimes quite sophisticated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these settlements there are a few buildings which in most cases are occupied by Europeans and cluttered around these houses are the wiltjas in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously when the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were on the move they did not create an unhealthy situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have got away from their natural foods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas previously the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> used to hunt on foot, now one sees quite a few motor cars around these camps and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> use them to go out after kangaroos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> augment their diet with the food they buy from the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Commonwealth Government has set up some prototype dwellings for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Finke in the lower part of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of dwelling combines some European aspects with some features favoured by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is housing that can be used more or less as transitionary housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Port Augusta many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are able to get employment with the Commonwealth Railways, possibly the local town council, the Electricity Trust of South Australia and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The employment opportunities are there to a certain extent but these, towns do not provide all the employment opportunities that we would hope would be available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am aware that the Housing Trust of South Australia does allot a certain number of houses to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but the Trust vets them pretty closely and it puts the screws on if the houses are not kept up to scratch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that there are employment opportunities in a number of these places but it is frequently found that no houses are available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and they have to wait for accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meant in many cases that although the employment could be arranged the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not able to take up the employment because of the shortage of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the figures supplied by the Minister in regard to the number of Commonwealth houses, 30 homes were built in South Australia but of that number very few were built in areas where employment existed for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the amazing things to me is that in Port Augusta where there is a population of between 500 and 600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> no homes have been built for them for 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The topic was ‘Housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in South Australia*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these people spoke of the bad conditions that apply in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point they made was that a great many of these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are receiving unemployment benefits and that a great many are deserted wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should involve itself in many of the other problems which confront <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government plans to construct a proper school in that locality but there are no houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The teachers who have been appointed to those schools - I have spoken to several of them - are young and dedicated and have a genuine interest in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much depends on the background of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can compare people who have lived in completely dependent circumstances all of their lives and who find it difficult to make decisions with people like the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Yirrkala where, under the guidance of the Methodist Mission for something of the order of a generation without any attempt to break down the Aboriginal culture, they enjoy the best of both worlds, as it were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are able to stand up for themselves and to express opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers of that Office look at the problems fairly and I am sure that the recommendations that they make to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  are well balanced and represent a much broader approach to the problems than is the case with many of the State administrations because the State administrations are tied down with their own administrative problems in settlements and reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1967 referendum raised the hopes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they might have a new future in Australia - a future of equality, noi in the never never but in their own lifetimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland has new legislation which was brought in late one week and rushed through the Parliament early the following week against the background of a demonstration by a number of unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were led by officers of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders Tribal Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sad thing that this legislation was not brought down in circumstances which would have enabled the whole range of people interested in Aboriginal welfare - no less the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves - to express their views on the legislation in order that whatever emerged from the Queensland Parliament might be the best possible legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a deteriorating relationship between the staff and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been mainly brought about, as I said earlier, by the rising expectations of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and our failure to meet them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an insufficient involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in staff and technical positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> know that por tions of their reserves can be cut off at the whim of a Cabinet or by the GovernorinCouncil if some of that land happens to contain bauxite, valuable timber or some other mineral resource which could be exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a problem in getting an effective voice for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So although on the face of it the Aboriginal council may appear to be an independent agent of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in effect it is actually too closely dependent upon the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no easy solution to that problem because in some of these areas the more enterprising young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have gone into the outside community looking for work in the pastoral industry and the like and the people who are left behind often do not have a great deal of leadership capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is a problem of alienation between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> come down and ask me to explain some social service problem, some technicality about an unemployment benefit or a tuberculosis allowance that should have been explained to them on the settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would probably receive only a handful of the many problems that exist in a place like that and which are never picked up because of the alienation between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have programmes that meet the people on the settlements; we have programmes such as secondary school scholarships for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whose families are assimilated in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we have no effective programmes in the broad to cater for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in a fringe dwelling environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the cities cannot be left to the housing commissions alone because very often <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, because they lack training or because they may occupy labouring positions, may go from job to job and they do not have the basic requirements which would give them a priority in the system of the housing- commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is need for a special housing programme for urban <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is an inevitable part of the acceptance of responsibility by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are ways and means of helping <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has to do it directly himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When are we going to tackle the problem concerning Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the same vigour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The local councils were able to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, so <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had full employment for the first time, so far as one can tell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This had a remarkable effect not only on the morale of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also upon the towns themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to take my full 20 minutes this evening, not because I have lost interest in the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and not because I have lost my verve or my desire to do something about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we can do nothing with it and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts who is now at the table can use all his charm; he has quite a deal of charm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not particularly concerned with ownership in the sense that we use the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been stated, the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  set up a special committee of Cabinet and, assisted by the Minister for the Enrivonment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  it investigated a number of matters relating to this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Ronald Berndt, of the University of Western Australia, said in the three years since he last visited the mission the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had become apathetic and disillusioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unles action was taken immediately, the 500 or so <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the mission would be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the coming of the store, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - primarily from the Gunwinggu tribe - were well on their way to adapting themselves to the ‘tremendous changes’ going on around them; at the same time retaining something of their cultural heritage, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not know how to cope with the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When asked a question in relation to bis powers to issue a permit under section 140E of the Licensing Ordinance, specifically having regard to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the witness replied: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man was supposed to be looking after the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but he did not consult them because they were before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It disclosed a disgraceful situation where the welfare officer gave no evidence to assist the court, where the applicant had no concern whatsoever for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - he merely wanted a hotel licence to do what a storekeeper did on the other side of Arnhem Land - where there was talk about the accommodation of visitors whereas the mine discourages visitors and where every point of view was taken into account except the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our country would  be richer if there were more speeches of the type made by the honourable member for Bradfield regarding the peoples of the Northern Territory and particularly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> It is true that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> trudge for days after they get their social service cheques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without mentioning socialism or nationalism, if ever there was an industry that needed Government control to remove the profit motive it is the liquor industry in the Northern Territory, so that no more would a person selling intoxicating liquor be able to enrich himself through the intoxication of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable member for Bradfield has said is true and I hope the Parliament and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  will read what he said and do something about the intoxication of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the profit motive behind the sale of liquor to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a report by Professor Berndt, a Western Australian anthropologist, of the social behaviour of Aboriginal men and women since a liquor store opened on a mining lease at East Alligator River crossing late in 1969 despite objections by the adjoining mission and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and of his claim that the mission would soon be forced to close unless immediate action was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Advisory Council on Northern Territory Aboriginal Affairs which includes 12 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> representing communities throughout the Territory will be given every opportunity, to consider the effects of the introduction of liquor in Aboriginal communities and to advise on action which might be taken in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to these two positions, there are specialist employment officers in all Regional Offices and most District Employment Offices who provide counselling and assistance to the physically and socially handicapped, young people, elderly workers, <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, ex-prisoners and others with special problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people concerned are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are demonstrating in a peaceful way for a case in which they believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So neither I nor the Government have seen any great cause for concern about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that statement, the Prime Minister dealt with the Government’s overall policy for Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and its specific policy on land and gave a summary of the Commonwealth’s achievements in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now I would like to inform the House of the Government’s intentions for the advancement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and explain the implications of our present policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek in this that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will achieve effective and respected places in a single Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a right to decide for themselves at what pace and to what extent they come to Identify themselves with that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thought of separate development of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a long-term aim is completely alien to the Government’s objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainly, these decisions are concerned with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, because it is a vast area of Australia in which the Commonwealth has direct responsibility for the development of the 22,000 Aboriginal Australians there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me deal firstly with the decisions that have been made for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to continue substantially to follow their traditional way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that there shall be no doubt whatsoever, the Government has decided to provide explicitly in legislation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have effective access for hunting and foraging on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> already enjoy, by law, these rights on lands covered by pastoral leases off reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the opinion of the Government, these 4 new decisions make it clear that everything is being done to allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to continue their present way of life to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible under these proposals for a community or group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to obtain a 50-year lease of land at a nominal rent for a variety of purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my second reading speech on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill last October, governments throughout Australia are spending some $44m this year on behalf of 140,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, in addition, as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, several reports are being prepared by expert committees on special problems which affect the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the north and these reports will give valuable guidance to those concerned with Aboriginal development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that impressed me greatly during my recent trip to the reserves in the western part of the Northern Territory was that there are no longer any nomadic <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that part of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Port Keats mission community I saw <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> engaged in making bricks, sawing timber and erecting their own homes - in fact, entering into this new way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Yuendumu the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have made remarkable progress; they have their own modern community hall, a community store and various worthwhile enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  deals with Aboriginal land rights alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no excuse now for the Commonwealth saying that the great variety of social, economic, political and cultural matters in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have the same opportunity as other Australians can be dealt with by the Commonwealth only in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Commonwealth now can deal with the whole range of these matters and can bring to bear upon them the entire resources of this nation in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wherever they live or move in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is doing it increasingly in the Northern Territory and there is no possible reason why the Commonwealth should not do it directly for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States on each side of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish that the Commonwealth would provide these facilities for all children of preschool age, but the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need it more than any other identifiable group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no time to go into the other fields where the Commonwealth could now assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should similarly make provision for hospitals in those areas in the States where there is a discernible number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the first point 1 wish to make - that the Commonwealth should not now limit its horizons to the Northern Territory because, since the referendum in 1967, it can make provisions for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in any areas where there is a significant number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> anywhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is asserted that both these bodies recommended that full title for land should be given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the basis of traditional occupancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it is proper to apply this excessive governmental secrecy to matters which concern <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if these reports were presented to the public and to the Parliament much more would be done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than has been done or is being done in this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without being too partisan in these matters, the development of Commonwealth assistance for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory has been inhibited for too long, as not only the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts but his predecessor with responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  have found, by a succession of Country Party Ministers for the Interior, and it has been inhibited in the States by the fact that there is a predominantly Country Party Government in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming to the substance of this proposal, it does not satisfy the Australian Labor Party that there should be such patronising proposals for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately there are indications that the 144,000 Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be used as a political football this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since white settlement the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have suffered one injustice after another, and they have gone from one disability or another, but it would be tragic if for the first time they are to be used for political motives and purposes by Communist elements and left-wing union leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yirrkala people as well as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in urban and rural slums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communist controlled unionists, the so-called peace movements, Maoists, Trotskyites and left-wingers generally are hellbent on dividing the Australian nation on racist issues, using the 144,000 part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and full blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a launching pad for their own motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emotional speeches, high sounding phrases and cliches and a clamour for land rights in itself will not overcome the disabilities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, it is true to say that no government has done more to recognise the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to assist in the advancement of the Aboriginal people than this Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially the Government’s aim is to have a single Australian society, including Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, having equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim is to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will achieve an efficient and respected place in the single Australian society, preserving their own cultures, languages, traditions and arts if they so desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the thought of separate development of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is completely alien to the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is against this background that we should look at what the Government is doing in the Northern Territory, the Territory over which I have responsibility and in which there are 22.000 full blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> many of whom have been in contact with European civilisation for the past few years only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been 135 applications received for leases from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, some for very large areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has announced, as my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  has said, that an additional $13m is to be provided for the purchase of properties and land coming on the market from outside the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are grants and loans available from public moneys and also the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund to establish <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition gave a wrong impression with respect to sites of special and historical significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are set aside for all time for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The claim for $6 billion compensation for dispossession of land in the past which has been made by some groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> inspired by radical groups flows quite naturally from the argument that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> anywhere in Australia have a&gt; moral, if not a legal, right to land based on ancestral association with that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> where there bad been an historical association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a tremendous amount of confusion over the whole issue, particularly as it applies to the Northern Territory, because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in fact getting entitlement to land for themselves and are applying for it under the terms and conditions and are happy to operate under them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside this Parliament, according to Press reports, a spokesman for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> said that they wanted full State rights of the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership together with all other reserves and settlements in Australia with their titles to mining and mineral rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the principal claim for land rights seems to be for compensation for land which it is claimed was taken away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over the past 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numbers of people have remarked to me that the protagonists of land claims for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are frequently neither Aboriginal nor part-Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, some of those who have an interest in attacking our present order of society have declared that with the passing of the Vietnam crisis the next big crusade will come in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that each objective set is designed to solve the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anybody really wants to see one land law for Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and another land law for other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Administration is concentrating its efforts on developing an education system more closely related to the special needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because of their different background and, where possible, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being used as assistants in the teaching profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are plans for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to own service stations and motels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In nearly every case the groups concerned will be receiving grants or loans from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This income will increase substantially as a result of the uranium mining at Nabarlek in the near future for the benefit of 22,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I visited Docker River with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a wonderful people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now seen him displaying himself in the role of the Pontius Pilate of the Northern Territory and of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the rest of Australia, wiping his hands absolutely of any real responsibility for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all of the 150 years before that, nobody had created an atmosphere in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could speak with a free voice, with an equal voice or with self respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation has now been created in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are joining the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who step into the community to assert their rights, to show what they stand for and to speak in their own right are speaking as part of the real Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Interior and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  have been patting themselves on the back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent statement of Commonwealth policy towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was not based on direct consultations with them, was directed as much towards a European as an Aboriginal public, and was couched in words that, to a considerable extent must have passed over the heads even of English-speaking <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made another point which is relevant because both the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and the Minister for the Interior referred to the Yirrkala people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he did not explain sufficiently what he would do regarding land for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the coloured people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  mentioned the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and the health situation at the Alice Springs Hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not long ago the Leader of the Opposition made a promise, which has received widespread publicity, that he would grant freehold land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, when he mentions land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> does he include Torres Strait Islanders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he acquire this land from existing landholders out of Commonwealth revenue if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> applied for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I ask the Leader of the Opposition: Is what he spoke about today but has not covered fully yet ALP policy on land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or is it his own thoughts on the matter or something he dreamed up on the spur of the moment for political expediency to gain the support of the coloured people prior to the next election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They support the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but no speaker has opposed this particular suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What bothers trie is that we are reaching the stage when several groups are being formed and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being led along a dead end path. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement the Minister for the Environment <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  outlined the Government’s policy on Aboriginal land rights - a policy with which I am sure the great majority of our coloured people will be happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  suggested that the Australian Labor Party’s policy was one of separate development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on settlements and reserves in country areas will choose to come to the city where greater opportunities exist just as many people who live in rural areas choose to come to the city, but we believe that the decision to assimilate with the broad Australian community should be made by free choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders should have the choice of coming into our society or remaining in their own communities with all the opportunities that our education gives them and with all the background that their own culture may give them as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Interior made the point that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - he mentioned the people of Yirrkala - were happy with the form of land tenure being offeredto them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question must be answered before we can accept the statement of the Minister for the Interior that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Yirrkala are happy with this form of land tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it has developed special curricula and established special forms of schools to cater for special needs because of the specific background of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Aboriginal lands to be vested in a public trust or trusts composed of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders as appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That exclusive corporate land rights be granted to Aboriginal communities which retain a strong tribal structure or demonstrate a potential for corporate action in regard to land at present reserved for the use of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or where traditional occupancy according to tribal custom can be established from anthropological or other evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sacred sites of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be mapped and protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An interesting statement of the Government’s altitude to land rights was made in the last publication by the Government on Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, made under the authority of the then Minister for Territories, the hon C. E. Barnes, in July 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> become independent members of the Australian community, land must be reserved for their use normally within their tribal territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live on Aboriginal reserves for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of people like the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Yirrkala, who have already been mentioned, and in Arnhem Land, who have lived on their traditional and tribal lands, the policy of the Labor Party is to vest these lands in local trusts with the local people involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably they could sell out to other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it would be a corporate trust We do not want them to be like the Red Indians in the United States who, when they received land rights, had a situation where generations of chiefs lived it up and their descendants have remained paupers to this day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all fairness, I must say that 1,415 square miles of that land was allocated to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Aboriginal organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other circumstances in Australia - not in the Commonwealth territories - there are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on reserves for a different purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Settlements’ which, on page 96, table 21 gives details of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> removed to settlements and missions in Queensland between 1911 and 1940. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This table points out that there were 5,672 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> removed and in a note at the bottom of the table it indicates that this figure does not convey the true number of people that were removed, because sometimes it represented the head of a family, when his family was removed with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, today, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in many cases occupy land which in earlier days was regarded as not capable of being developed for pastoral projects and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having destroyed the Aboriginal population of 251,000 which existed at the time Captain Cook discovered the eastern seaboard of this country are we now in our generation, to take away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders What yet remains? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must cater for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on the fringes of country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to develop schemes where these people can be compensated for loss of land rights and this probably means acquiring allotments and assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to obtain houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could perhaps be done by giving them allotments and providing them with a deposit under a scheme similar to the Housing Commission scheme which would make it economic for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be decently housed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, for many tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in urban areas - the indications are that over 60 per cent of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at least need rehousing because of low standard accommodation - we must develop schemes of compensation for loss of land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made by several Government supporters tonight that by developing these policies we will develop a white backlash; that we are to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so many advantages that underprivileged nonAboriginal people in Australia will feel antagonistic towards the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our task in this generation - in our time - and it is our responsibility as members of the Federal Parliament with a direct responsibility in the Northern Territory to carry into effect such enlightened policies as will enable people in the future to say: ‘Many wrongs were done to the Aboriginal people of Australia but in the 1970s the Parliament of the day rectified the position and set the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the road to equal opportunity in the Australian community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there is any honourable member in this House who has had more experience in working among ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than has the Minister for the Interior, and I wish that we could hear about some of his experiences instead of some of the statements which have been made in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He alleged that Country Party Ministers had retarded the progress of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and I take that as a reflection on the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that honourable members opposite may be interested to hear what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves think about this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he would say that in Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not receive a fair deal until the LiberalCountry Party coalition came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is telling the people of Australia that we cannot hurry progress for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight, running through the speech of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts was talk of consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not refer to the discriminatory state of affairs that operates around Australia in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make no apology for -the fact that we intend to put our alternative programme to the people of this country because it is not only idealistic but it is also in keeping with the programme which operates in other countries where there are indigenous people, if ever there was an occasion of anti-Australian statements it was the no land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> speech delivered on Australia Day by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This matter was raised this afternoon and we were asked what we would do about land set aside for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders has decided by resolution to launch a national campaign urging the granting of Aboriginal land rights and, in particular, the granting of full title and rights to compensation with respect to all existing Aboriginal reserve land throughout Australia, and the provision of land for all Aboriginal individuals and groups seeking to live on, use and develop land in their traditionally occupied areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not just the point of view of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders but also it is the point of view of the Australian Council of Churches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, upon notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-41-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are in the underprivileged section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in my own area there is quite a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What area of land is owned by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in Territories under the control of the Commonwealth, either as individuals or associated groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory since legislation providing for the grant of leases of land within reserves to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Aboriginal groups came into operation in December 1970, 65 leases have been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points made by the Reverend Grierson is that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and others in outlying districts, which are defined as any places more than 5 miles from the nearest polling booth, are automatically supplied with a ballot paper in elections in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have available statutory declarations from a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but an insufficient number to put in a protest on the particular poll in the Stuart electorate showing that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were registered did not receive ballot papers or that they were held up somewhere on the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not compulsory for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to register and there is no systematic registration campaign carried out by electoral officers although funds are allocated for this express purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an offence at the present time for anyone else to canvass <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enrol as voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why the present complicated system of postal votes is used in the Stuart electorate, unless it is for the purpose of preventing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressure is also exerted on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the practical disenfranchisement of many Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a consequence of neglect and indifference, it is a disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why do <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when they get the chance vote for the Labor Party candidate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts in his capacity as Minister in Charge of Tourist Activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a request tonight to the Minister for Health, firstly, to recognise the bush nursing centre as an approved place for the treatment of pensioners under the national health scheme - it is obvious that that should be done; secondly, to take action to ensure that all medical and hos pital funds properly recognise the treatment given - let us end the 80c charge for a confinement; and, thirdly, to ensure that there is adequate Commonwealth compensation for the thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> treated over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of these places there are substantial Aboriginal populations and these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are treated there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that an Ordinance is about to be gazetted that will make illegal the demonstration by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outside Parliament House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister on 23rd February last in answering a question by the right honourable member for Higgins describe the demonstration as one that concerned <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were demonstrating in a peaceful way for a cause in which they believed, that they had been quiet and well behaved and had co-operated with the police extremely well? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he also say that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had observed every request that the police had made of them, that there was no litter or health problem and that the Government saw no great cause for concern about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are: The widow pensioners training scheme; the national service vocational training scheme; the employment training scheme for women restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities; the employment training scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; the employment training scheme for persons displaced by technological change; and the rural reconstruction employment training scheme to which the honourable member made passing reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was the widow pensioners training scheme run by the Department of Social Services the second was the national service vocational training scheme; the third was the employment training scheme for women restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities; the fourth was the employment training scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; the fifth - this is one that was mentioned - was the employment training scheme, for persons displaced by technological change; and the sixth was the rural reconstruction employment training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 4 schemes which I just mentioned - the widow pensioners training scheme, the national service vocational training scheme, the employment training scheme for women restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities and the employment training scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - stand in this way at the present time: They have been available for over 12 months and each has been effective in assisting a significant number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- First of all, I hope that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  can assure us that there will be no impediment to or suspension of the activities in the area of the crafts which is currently being supported by the Arts Council of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be a very difficult task for the new Teaching Service to equate the service of a teacher in one of those authorities - say, a teacher teaching <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory - with the service of a teacher at, say, the Narrabundah school here in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many teachers are interested in teaching <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but under the scheme which has been operating to date they were enlisted in the Northern Territory Administration school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can think of the Australian Capital Territory, the teaching of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and serving in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the honourable gentleman: Will senior counsel be appointed to assist this board, as in the case of the inquiry into general medical practitioners’ fees in New South Wales, and will that counsel be available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their well-wishers in the preparation and presentation of their written and ora] submissions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the last part of the question, I will make further inquiries to ascertain whether this sort of facility will be available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear that I have had discussions with the officers of my Department to ensure that this committee of inquiry travels throughout the Northern Territory so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can give evidence before it as much as possible - to ensure that the committee goes to Aboriginal centres or to as many of them as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a lot of nonsense it is to say that the next Prime Minister of South Vietnam,  Mr Huong,  made a request through the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just one comment before 1 commence: It is interesting to note that Ambassador Anderson described the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  as the most fluent French  speaker  in the Australian foreign services; that is just for the record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party does believe in discrimination when dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that after 200 years during which we have discriminated against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> it is necessary in the years immediately ahead for us to discriminate in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in certain ways in order that we may redress the wrongs we have done to them in the past, and to overcome problems such as malnutrition, poor housing, cultural deprivation, lack of education and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Labor Party believes - this is not very far from the sentiments expressed by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who has just come into the chamber, in the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill introduced not long ago - that this sort of assistance is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in the period immediately ahead of us we have to discriminate in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in order to give them equality of opportunity in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not alone in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the policy of the Labor Party as far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at that Party’s complete absence of policy - and the Liberal Party is in the same position - one can well understand why the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> suffered so much under Liberal-Country Party governments - particularly State governments - over all the years before the Commonwealth, by constitutional change, took up at least part of the challenge thrown down to it by the people of Australia at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to give the lie, if I can, to the idea that discriminating in favour of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the way in which the Labor Party proposes to do it - in housing and other ways - will cause racism in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live under a great range of environments from one end of this country to the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may speak from the point of view of my own electorate of Brisbane, there were very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living there until comparatively recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the rural depression and the drift of country people, including <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to the cities, large numbers of Aboriginal families now live there in sub-standard housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discriminating in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by policies in this way is not only ensuring that problems of racism in the long term are minimised but also making a great contribution towards the Australian community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think he should look at his own Party’s policy which treats the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as part of our past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is proud of its policy for Aboriginal advancement and, instead of our being accused, because we have developed sophisticated policies for Aboriginal advancement, of using the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a political football, I would like to see the Country Party and the Liberal Party devoting some of their energies to developing policies of similar sophistication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made a great attack on the Premier of Queensland and the policy of the present Queensland Government in the matter of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will answer that with just one example of the contribution which Labor made to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After years of agitation, pleading, appealing and all sort of petitions going down to Brisbane to the Labor government of the day, it decided to meet our request for a home for transient <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a great centre where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reside in the north west. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was built for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the then Labor government was a large galvanised iron shed with an earth floor and not even partitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one example of Labor’s concern for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>^ When I go back home my Aboriginal friends say to me: ‘Well, Bob, what are they going to do for us poor <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Commonwealth committee is the National Radiation Advisory Committee (NRAC) which reports to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts and advises the Commonwealth Government on matters concerning the effects of ionising radiation, whatever its origin, on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first is that it seems an unusually cumbersome process to split responsibility for these monitoring programmes between two committees, one of which reports to the Minister for Supply and the other to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts,  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tn 1947 when this Parliament did not deal with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the way it does now, or with education in the way it does now, and when its involvement in so many areas of foreign policy was less acute and many other areas of public policy were not before it, the House met on 92 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I welcome the statement that has been made to the House this afternoon by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  as indeed does the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  know that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  had indicated that he wished to respond to other matters that have been raised tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question which, is directed to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts follows on his announcement that a proposal for a national film and television training school would be resurrected, although in a much truncated form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have this constant harping, and the attempts to make the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> feel racially and become a black power operation, if we have this rather pathetic ‘embassy’ cluttering up the area in front of Parliament House, and if we are to adopt the policy of the Labor Party Opposition which was adopted in Launceston, and people are simply to be admitted without regard to race, colour and so on, and if there is to be a change in our present policy, for heaven’s sake let us look down the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reality the section provides that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be excluded from the provisions of the Act and they can work under conditions different from those which apply to other people such as Europeans, Australians or anyone else to whom the provisions of the Act apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summation, I suggest to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, that he convey this submission to the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  so that he may review the constraints that I have, mentioned and so that he may look at the research project within the CSIRO which has been held up in order to evaluate what is being done and to indicate needs in a forward way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision was put there in connection with the voting rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not of persons under 21, but it is clearly applicable to the age issues as well if section 41 of the Constitution is interpreted as 1 have suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are apparently unaware that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves are  Caucasians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have any sensitivity at all, we should take the trouble to see the conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to remind us of the problem with which we ought to be deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All through this situation we had firstly a Liberal Minister in charge of Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable W. C. Wentworth, and now  we have  the Minister  for  the Environment <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts,  the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When any of these Aboriginal evictions or denials of right take place the Liberal Minister who is supposedly the defender of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> does, like the House of Lords in Gilbert and Sullivan, nothing in particular and does it very . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1972, hi answer to a question from the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  atom the campers, I indicated that the people concerned were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> demonstrating in a peaceful way for a cause in which they believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of the Government taking action against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it is a question of the Government facing up to its responsibilities of preserving public places in Canberra for public use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The police requested the demonstrators, comprising part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans, to permit them to remove the remaining tent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was agreed that the Commonwealth would bring 9 leaders nominated by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to Canberra to discuss the matter with the Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 29th July my colleagues, the Minister for Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  and the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the  Chairman  of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs  (Dr Coombs)  and officers of my Department met with Aboriginal leaders in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the record, I am pleased to say that, in spite of attempts by radical groups to pressure <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from my own home town of Moree, they refused to be associated with the activities of those who were hell-bent on creating further violence outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were there for political reasons; that they were there not just to live in a tent but to make a political point; and that they were exercising a right to assemble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> made it clear that they hoped to stay there until Parliament began sitting in order to make their point - the Minister says it was a political point - concerning a claim for land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, like any human being, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> said: We will not be told not to do something which we want to do, which is completely legal and which we are allowed to do’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not really see any reference to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister, when it comes to a question of his credibility, that on television he said that when the ordinance came in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be given a couple of weeks - a reasonable time–within which to get off the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and white people linked arm in arm around the remaining tent which carried the flag and the sign ‘Aboriginal Embassy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognised the Reverend Jim Udy, a very respectable clergyman in Canberra, linked arm in arm with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognised the Reverend George Garnsey, another very respected and responsible clergyman from Canberra, linked arm in arm with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognised Bruce Kent, another responsible, recognised and well known man in Canberra, linked arm in arm with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will tell honourable members this: On the second time round when the 2,000 people assembled, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> searched each other - this is a measure of their responsibility - to ensure that there would be no arms of any sort on any of them if anything got out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That afternoon I received a message that some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and some of the gentlemen to whom I have already referred had gone to the police station to lend moral support to the people who had been arrested as  a  result of the fracas and who were being released on bail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sent him a telegram because all of the reports said that he and his colleague - I suppose that one can call the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  a colleague - were in Darwin or somewhere doing something else probably quite irrelevant, given the situation that had arisen in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They talked about the cause of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the cause of land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that I have been endeavouring to do as Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts is to improve the dialogue between the Government and the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it has been for this purpose that for the last few months I have been endeavouring to call together a conference of as widely rep resentative groups of Aboriginal people as possible in order to start that dialogue between the Government and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having stated how I believe we shall be able to understand these needs more closely, I now wish to inform the House of what has taken place while I have been Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these important matters have been raised let me refer to the important decisions we have made respecting land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the very point that is being dealt with now by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there are 4,000 scholarships in use by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  introduced the general question of Aboriginal administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in the comment made by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts about the Government’s aim to create a single society in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we all recognise that most of the Aboriginal people of Australia will probably choose to be assimilated into our society, as a great number of them have, the Labor Party recognises the right of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who choose to stay in their own communities to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the government in this country has never acknowledged the land rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the way in which the land rights of the Red Indians of Canada and the United States of America and the land rights of the indigenous populations of South America and other places were acknowledged by the respective colonial governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was situated in tents which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could afford to buy, to erect and to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a protest against the failure of this Government to understand what land means to the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts spoke about the Government’s plans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the things that frustrate the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as they frustrate many people on this side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> stand up to fight for something it is immediately suspected that they are being manipulated by other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may get something, or they may get nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders or any other Aboriginal organisation continue to negotiate under those circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was similar action by the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister carries the burden of responsibility for the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are to be areas on which people can park, then anybody can erect a tent city whether they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or members of the Returned Services League or the Country Women’s Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe th.it on the first count the Minister was entirely right, in protecting the public interest, in removing this tent city not because it was anything to do with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but because he should have done so no matter whom it had anything to do with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to over emotionalise the aspect of the fallout from the French nuclear tests but I want to draw to the attention of the House some facts which have been stated by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in his statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Reid pointed out to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  what he calls the ‘conservative view’ stated on page 4 of this statement where these words appear: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Reid asked the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts what he had done or what anyone on behalf of the Australian Government had done to try to persuade the French to accept the Australian Government’s view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the statement made by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Prime Minister lay down firm guidelines for future acquisition of land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in accordance with the statement he made on Australia Day this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education of Migrants and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are chronically disadvantaged at the age of 6, at the age of 10 and at the age of 12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adult grants to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need to be diversified and an attack on Aboriginal adult illiteracy deliberately launched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When grants are made to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to assist them with their education, this is done under the Commonwealth power of benefits to students but, after all, what is the reason for this special assistance to an Aborigine to receive an education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It never asks whether this ability is intrinsic, and except in the case of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> it is not seeking pastoral care, remedial care or curative care of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the root of the present national sickness - the feeling deeply held by whole sections of the community, the employees, large sections of the employers, the youth, the poor, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that their own elected Government is . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Commonwealh has stated its position in a statement made by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is there one law for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in front of Parliament House and another law for the people in the Prime Minister’s Department at the rear of it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but large in terms of human values, namely, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - these bewildered, gentle folk of another civilisation whose land we share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the Government will spend $53m in direct aid to 144,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which amounts to about $370 a head, .man, woman and child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not prepared to see a separate race within a race developed in Australia, with an embassy from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the Government of Australia as though they were a foreign power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget, which raises aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by 70 per cent - or over $21 m - shows a better way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must compliment the Government on the decision to give special assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a good decision which must be applauded by all people who have some interest in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of our country* I think that more could have been done, but this is a lot more than has ever been done before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24th May last, speaking on behalf of the Government, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  said that all Federal action would require an ‘environment impact statement’ about future legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We expect the displays of the art of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the arts of the Pacific Basin, including the rich art of Melanesia, embracing Papua New Guinea, to be of world standard and a revelation to all exposed to them for the first time when the Gallery is opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, $24m is being allocated for the assistance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The overall amount for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia has been increased by 58 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a policy, and funds are available, to acquire stations off reserves for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that they can learn how to operate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said on the last occasion that we discussed the Estimates, the Government has to find suitable people to lead the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into organising and running these projects themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the inquiry cover <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deprivation, discrimination and repression of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian society, whether they are fringe dwelling urban residents or living in rural communities, stand as a monument to the selfish and cruel indifference of this wealthy community of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In February 1971  Dr William  Langsford, the Director of the Northern Territory divisional office of the Department of Health, was ordered to slash his expenditures by $200,000 and it is reported that he noted in his diary that day ‘disaster day’ because he knew that the people who would surfer as a result of this reduction would be the unfortunate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory where infant mortality rates are 6 times the Australian rate for the white population; where in that area tuberculosis is 60 per 100,000 population compared to IS per 100,000 for the rest of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was possible, as in fact it was, with a national campaign to reduce tuberculosis rates among the non-Aboriginal population from 52 per 100,000 in 1947 to 15 per 100,000 by 1970, why have we not shown similar initiatives and resourcefulness and a similar moral commitment to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we go through the whole range of the morbidity pattern among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we will find that in any form of morbidity <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a rate considerably higher than Europeans in the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People could have examined them and those who are interested could have said: ‘We would have liked to have seen something better done in relation to hospitals, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or in this defence area or in that education area’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I absolve the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is sitting at the table, from guilt in this matter, lt was the Minister for the Navy who made the suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I would like to express the personal satisfaction I received when the Royal Lifesaving Society of Australia and the Surf Lifesaving Association of Australia received an increase in the grants in aid from the Department responsible to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  who is now sitting at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget will provide for taxation reductions, pension increases, social services, the lifting of the means test, housing, health, education, child welfare, estate duty, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, defence, shipping, airlines, gift duty, nursing homes, special grants and fares for the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to this loophole which exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As my Department of Primary Industry is responsible for the general negotiations that take place within the International Whaling Commission it might be appropriate if I explained to the House that there was no inconsistency between the vote cast by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts at Stockholm and the others made within the International Whaling Commission for the control of resources of whales around the oceans of the world, lt needs to be recognised that whaling is an industry which today has contracted significantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no discrepancy between the action taken by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, and that taken by officers of my Department with the International Whaling Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far back as May members of the Labor Party and political commentators were predicting that there would be across the board increases in social services and repatriation benefits, that there would be reductions in taxation, that the education commitment of the Commonwealth would be increased, that there would be improvements in the national health scheme, that there would be an increase in home savings grants, that there would be a few incentives to primary and secondary industries and a sop or 2 to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that on 24th May this year the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  stated that, when Commonwealth Government money was involved in anything that could have an environmental impact, an impact statement would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  whether any impact statement has been prepared by the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, because Commonwealth money is being used for a project in a Commonwealth Ter ritory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister responsible for the Corporation - the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  - might care to claim that the Corporation’s role has consisted primarily of creating a climate of stability and confidence in the Australian feature film industry, encouraging private investors to join in the development of that industry, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  been hovering around in the background on this one too? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have found a fault in the law and their finding indicates sheer incompetence in the law-making processes of the Government that goes beyond <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and camping outside Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls the Treasurer aware that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, has indicated that environmental impact statements will be prepared on the effects of any Government measures but only if the responsible Ministers request them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not quite sure of the circumstances in which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, uses the term ‘impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could not really co-relate what the Minister for the Environment <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  meant by an ‘impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people concerned are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are demonstrating in a peaceful way for a cause in which they believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So neither I nor the Government have seen any great cause for concern about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the Full Court yesterday aroused great hopes among the Aboriginal community that their expectations could be fulfilled and their aims achieved through the operation of the normal processes of the law, through what an increasing number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are coming to describe as ‘white man’s law’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a few hours yesterday on the lawns outside this House a few pieces of canvass flew as an assertion of the rights and dignity of the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today this Bill has been brought in to delay another historically inevitable event - the assertion by the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of their rights as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had not seen a copy of the ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining tent which carried the sign ‘Aboriginal Embassy’ and the flag - it is a symbol of the demonstration - had been surrounded by 20 or 30 people who were mainly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but included some white supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately there are indications that the 144,000 Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be used as a political football this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Interior went on to point out in the booklet what a tragedy it would be if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to be used for political motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What respect did he have for them as a part of the human race that has been denied all concepts of what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> consider to be their just and proper right in this unforgiving land of white supremacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on in the booklet to draw the red herring of hypocrisy about the fact that certain <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were claiming land rights and a total payment of some $6 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  was sincere in his speech on Australia Day this year and if he was sincere in what he had to say to the Aboriginal lass that he clasped his arms around in Adelaide during a visit to that city in the winter months about the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he should have challenged the making of this ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The marauders in front of this House at midnight last night did not draw blood, but they may well have drawn blood because of their failure to appreciate the meaning of the basic principle of land rights to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has done absolutely nothing, other than use a few words, to put into effect any form of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The documents relating to the proposed acquisition of that property on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not been tabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might interest honourable members opposite to learn that in door knocking in my electorate I have found to my surprise that the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the denial of their land rights by this Government rank as one of the main issues, at least in the minds of the womenfolk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my electorate of Sydney there are several thousand part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two field officers are working for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through this organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Minister who is supposed to represent the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia - the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  - has not spoken in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that in representing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia he is looking after their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he afraid that he might get the sack from his position of Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking on behalf of the part- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in the South Sydney area in my electorate of Sydney, I assure honourable members that they are absolutely disgusted with the action of this Government and that they will certainly vote accordingly at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is necessary to ensure that in relation to Commonwealth lands which are not just in front of Parliament House but right throughout the Australian Capital Territory there should be a specific understanding that there is a continued opportunity - indeed, a right - for people to demonstrate, to be present on those lands and to express their views as  a  minority or majority group, lt is not  a  right to erect tents or to create what all of us saw, in the language which the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  used quite effectively this afternoon, as a presence which we found objectionable not because of its intrinsic presence but because of its failure to achieve what the honourable member for Moreton and so many others on this side of the house believe is a valid cause of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like the honourable member for Moreton, feel that there is a great deal we can do to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our community but we should do it in such a way as to help them positively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The police arrived and an inspector of police went across to the assembled <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four or five years ago some university students decided to hold a vigil in connection with the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in difficulty about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because we know that after all these years of our history - nearly 200 years - it is time there was some sort of effective Aboriginal voice and Aboriginal presence in this national capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care whether it is in some cultural exhibit manned by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who can express their way of life; it is time the Aboriginal people were acknowledged in the Australian national capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some were people of part Aboriginal descent and some were people of Islander descent who identified themselves with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them had no idea what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the inland aspire to and some of them had genuine ideas about what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the inland aspire to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside the Parliament of Western Australia the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> erected a very beautiful tent and had established a dignified consulate, as they called it, as a means of demonstration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be a tent erected there for a fair, a circus, a carnival, a show or for any of those purposes but no-one has the power in the future to permit a tent to be erected there where the purpose is to demonstrate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided that a permit could be granted for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we could say that with the consent of the police or the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt),  the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could erect a tent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister what progress has been made in the negotiations to purchase the Everard Park property in South Australia for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the $13m land purchase policy announced by him earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that we will have a settlement soon and that this property will soon be handed over to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to suggest that the Ministry for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts - this Ministry which is very ambiguous in many respects and which from the environmental standpoint hardly seems to have come down to any positive line of objectivity - should start to accept some responsibility in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is in the House at the moment, has consciously applied himself to this matter and whether in fact he concedes that it ought to be the responsibility and the prerogative of his Department to liaise with the Post Office in this case and indeed with many other Departments where there is a responsibility to determine whether an historical building, such as the Customs House in Sydney, is to remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an old Army building and I think that all Australians would have been embarrassed had visitors from overseas seen the dilapidated condition of the building in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were being educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had evidence from Miss Sommerlad of the Australian National University who had done a 12-month study of the way of life of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly at Kormilda College. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main conflict before the Committee concerned the educational training methods for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was interested in the moral degradation of young girls who attend Kormilda College, return to the missions and become virtually victims of the lust of elderly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the year of its existence Kormilda College has been of tremendous and real value, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Aboriginal students from every corner of the Northern Territory - including those in Arnhem Land, those at Port Keats Mission and those down in the central area of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee did request evidence to be given on behalf of some of the churches in particular so that we would have as good a picture as possible of the type of building and the type of education which would be in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The College will play an increasingly important part in educating <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who, in turn, will be able to influence their families and other Aboriginals in the community to recognise the advantage of a better educational standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is necessary to expand the College as much as possible because it is through <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that we will be able to reach those other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are not yet convinced of the need for and the benefits of a higher standard of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Easter time when I was in the Northern Territory for a conference of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders I had an interesting discussion with 2 people involved with the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we make education for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> relevant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 2 of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Works it states that the Government’s policy is for assimilation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a parallel education system and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not enough to expect Kormilda College to be a halfway house in the transition of young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the Aboriginal society into our own society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to recognise that most of these young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are interested in learning something about our society, but probably most of them will choose to return to live in their own communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, during the hearing of evidence a lot of information came before the Committee with regard to this College and it was stressed on many occasions by witnesses that they would like to see more Aboriginal involvement in the teaching of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The College will do a good deal for the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area providing we do not frighten these people off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with my colleagues, I believe that there should be more involvement of Aboriginal teachers and others who understand the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and understand what we are trying to do for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this guardedly because I have lived in an area which has a lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and I have been to school with these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if we can involve some of our educated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the education of their people we could do a lot more for them than we are doing at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, however, some of the programmes of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs from the $8,045,000 available to it, after making the proposed States grants, will benefit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these programmes will benefit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly much remains to be done in the health field and the health status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> remains a cause for concern, particularly in respect of infant mortality and malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas in 1969 there might have been no more than 2,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in secondary schools throughout Australia, by 1972 there are of the order of 8,000, of whom 4,266 were in training as at June under the secondary grants scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this falls far short of the ideal: On a population percentage basis there should be some 13,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in secondary schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds have been granted to local and other authorities to provide employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on socially valuable projects chosen in accordance with criteria specified by my Office and the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These projects have enabled shire councils in many rural areas to carry out projects of value to their communities while at the same time providing employment and training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the research phase in our crocodile and turtle farming projects has made progress, and  Dr Bustard  has numbers of Torres Strait Islanders and coastal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> engaged in pilot farming projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as honourable members will already be aware, the whole direction of the capital fund for Aboriginal Enterprises operated  by the  Office is to assist suitable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become self-employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing programmes aim primarily to assist families, whose children will benefit thereby; a great deal of health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and children; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for younger <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist schoolleavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it important to bear in mind that the problems facing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in major towns and cities and those of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in communities on reserves, on pastoral properties and on the fringes of remote townships differ very greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The movement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the major cities has been quite striking over the past decade or two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we have placed an increasing emphasis on programmes to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at our major city, Sydney, one can see examples in all these fields: Either with the State or unilaterally we have provided hostels and houses, supported the Aboriginal health service in south Sydney, provided funds for schooling, pre-schooling and adult education facilities, assisted <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to find and hold employment, and supported the Aboriginal Legal Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During a visit which I paid some months ago, I was personally most impressed at the work being done by the Aboriginal Medical Service in south Sydney, and believe that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> involved are providing a referral or treatment service to numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Sydney metropolitan area who would not at this stage have the necessary confidence to seek treatment in the first instance from the normal community services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We expect that, as our programmes become more and more effective, the urbanised <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will need our assistance less and less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems little doubt that ample employment is available in the cities: What we seek to do is to remove those handicaps inhibiting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from taking full advantage of this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the remote <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, most of those involved are now living in static communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if almost all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have abandoned their semi-nomadic hunting and gathering life, this does not mean that the old tribal structures and beliefs have also disappeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should all try to realise that these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote situations are experiencing a difficult period of rapid change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should help them develop appropriate kinds of dwellings, such as the house developed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Finke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition we have embarked on a far-reaching programme to delineate areas which are of sacred or special significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we can through the provision of relevant education ensure that members of the remote communities become less and less dependent, while at the same time relating that education more directly to the sorts of employment we will be encouraging the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can find additional, different and meaningful employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote communities, we may expect the drift to the cities about which I spoke earlier to accelerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same month, on 24th May, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in a statement, entitled ‘Australian Environment - Commonwealth Policy and Achievements’, incorporated statements of the Government’s observations on the recommendations of the Senate Committee and concluded: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly we find that the largest semigovernment authorities in Australia, the ones which have most conspicuously failed to meet the requirements of a civilised community, are to have no help from the Commonwealth as far as the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts is concerned and no help from the Commonwealth as far as the present Prime Minister is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the suggested wood chip industry in the Gove Peninsula in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Yirrkala district could have a significant financial interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been an examination of a feasibility study that was publicly invited in 1968 as part of a Territory-wide investigation of wood chip timber which could form the basis for an industry to provide employment and also a financial return to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Arnhem Land - the principle area that has some potential for a wood chip industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no intention whatsoever on the part of the Government to proceed with any wood chip industry in the Aboriginal reserve area unless the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves are desirous of proceeding on an equity basis with companies in exploiting the timber of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24th May last, speaking on behalf of the Government, the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is now sitting on the front bench, made a statement that all Federal action would require an ‘environmental impact statement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has shown itself to be a complete washout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister state recently that the upsurge in the incidence of venereal disease amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reflected a worldwide trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-59-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister provide statistics showing the incidence of venereal disease in (a) <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and (b) Europeans in each State and Territory of the Commonwealth during the latest year for which information is available and for the year a decade earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-59-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also provide comparative figures supporting the statement that the incidence of venereal disease amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reflects a worldwide trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-59-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IS) What sum has been spent on education in respect of venereal disease amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during each of the last 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-59-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>refusing to restore land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on reserves or in significant communities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are: To investigate ways of providing a simple, flexible form of incorporation for Aboriginal communities; to amend the law under which land is reserved for the use and benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that a reserve cannot be revoked in whole or in part without an effective opportunity for a review both by the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory and by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament; to complete as expeditiously as possible programmes to delineate and protect areas of land both within and outside reserves for Aboriginal religious and ceremonial purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister then said that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘have a right to areas of special significance, but just to set aside land because they claim it tends to perpetuate the Aboriginal tribal system was no justification’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen claims that, although <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> account for only a little more than 1 per cent of the Australian population, they account for 10 per cent of Australia’s infant deaths, 28 per cent of the deaths of 1-year olds, about 10 per cent of the deaths of 2 to 4-year olds and 94 per cent of the deaths of lepers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From time to time, as an explanation for the failure to achieve any improvement, the Government has said that the health problem stems from the nomadic background of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - the fact that they are in mobile groups - but of course this is merely to say something about the problem and not to provide a justification for cbe problem not being more satisfactorily attended to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike sheep, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were never counted until 1966 and we are still far behind in getting an adequate idea of their position statistically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the statement of the Minister for Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes up all the factors of State expenditure and so on, one sees that about $53m has been spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question is: Do we recognise the right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be a distinctive people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Negatively we have been able to see the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a distinctive people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The old section 51, paragraph (xxvi), of the Constitution excluded the Commonwealth from the power to legislate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if we knew for whom we cannot legislate, presumably we could see <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know who these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wrote a disastrous book The Passing of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ which gave a couple of generations of Australian administrators the excuse for thinking that they did not need to do anything but smooth the dying pillow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot wear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we recognise the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be a distinctive people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Paul  Hasluck, as the relevant Minister, gave it a more humane touch where he said that assimilation meant <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would live at the same standard and have the same rights and so forth as Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should declare straightly that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are distinctive people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seats must be reserved for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory and the members for those seats should be elected by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  and I were both members of a select committee which examined the grievances of the Aboriginal people of Yirrkala. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point about those select committees was that the members of them went with interpreters to hear what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lived in a balanced relationship with the creatures they hunt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of us may remember that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had served the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy during the war as coast watchers and who had not been paid for 16 years seized the opportunity to make a statement about that and that this action led to their being paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point because those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been saying to welfare officers for 16 years that they had not been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the second unanswered question in the Minister’s second reading speech is: Will we provide for representation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as a distinct people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not matter where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the reading of the proclamation meant: ‘Hereafter you own nothing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say that they own the land for various reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see that I can practically assert that some descendant of the original tribe in Sydney owns all of Sydney, but there are large areas of land in Australia still vested in the Crown which are reserved to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and where there is a distinctive tribal ownership discernible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that rather tragic case before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory it appears that if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had had the forethought to run a wire along the land and to draw a boundary they would have received the same sorts of rights as a squatter has, only that they would have been better entitled as squatters from time immemorial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms the Government has set out under which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may operate some stations economically seems to us to be inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But George III did not need an alliance with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia and so no treaty was entered into with them to acknowledge their land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will we acknowledge the right of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to an education in their tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only sufferers from tuberculosis today are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we say that our policy is assimilation and ask an administrator what he has done to assimilate the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> today, there is no answer to the question because it is a senseless question and it is an imprecise objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  that the statement he is criticising is the second reading speech by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts on the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been in this Parliament for a long time and I have never once debated the issue of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before going on to state my opinions on this matter, I should like to say that I do not know how many honourable members have captained football teams which have played against Aboriginal teams and who on that basis know the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would go so far as to say that I for one, having given a lot of thought to this problem, find it most difficult to understand precisely why the last Aboriginal embassy, which unfortunately had to be removed from outside this House, had, on the night of its removal when one of our members went to it, no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not understand why we have to take so much notice of an Aboriginal embassy that evidently does not have <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why, when the Aboriginal embassy was set up in Brougham Place, Adelaide, it was set up entirely by interstate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the point in setting up an Aboriginal embassy such as the one in South Australia, where there are only interstate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> standing around* - I am being awfully polite - day and night? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  do not think this is fair to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whom I know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is fair to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with whom I have played sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  do not think for one moment that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are doing their cause an ounce of good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think frankly that members of the Opposition should explain to this Parliament and to the people of Australia just how they feel that the example set by these people in those places is helping the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because to the vast majority of Australians it is not helping their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members well know, part of the implication of that referendum was that the Federal Government should lend resources, interest and example to the States to help them equate with the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not here - this indicates the stupidity of the Opposition’s list of amendments - as a Federal government to guarantee <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> jobs in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor referred to housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand he says that our capacity to grant lands to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is way behind that of the countries of southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I know come from the Ooldeas, the Ernabellas and other northern missions and stations in South Australia until they meet people in the electorate of the honourable member for Grey  (Mr Wallis). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would take this as being the desirable method for the future development of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the estimates of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, there is a provision under the Office of Aboriginal Affairs for consultation and liaison with Aboriginal panels and associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland, the State which I know best, the Aboriginal councillors represent only those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I spoke on a similar Bill 2 years ago the Minister then responsible for the administration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> made some projections of the housing needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cited research that had been carried out in Sydney and elsewhere indicating that 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> already living in houses needed re-housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all recognise the wide range of environments in Australia and that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various parts of this continent have different needs and priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  and the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  pointed out that too many of the decisions concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being made for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and not by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have stood for electorates in the Northern Territory Legislative Council in the past but they have been unsuccessful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Council, the honourable member for Arnhem - which is where most of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the top end of the Northern Territory live - comes from a lay missionary background and knows the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> very well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can give first-class practical advice and assistance in places such as Milingimbi, Elcho Island, Bathurst Island, Croker Island, Goulburn Island and Maningrida with regard to developing projects which are in the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> residing in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that, when the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish to have representation in the Northern Territory Legislative Council they will nominate their own member and support him and he will be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a way of saying that anything that the Opposition considers the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have was automatically voted for by 90 per cent of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that some of the top end <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were fairly firm in their remarks and attitudes towards some people in Canberra who purported to support the Aboriginal cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Claude Narjic from Port Keats stated that he was quite capable of presenting the opinions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in northern Australia and that he did not have to be told by people whom he did not consider to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> how to go about things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are quite capable of consulting and giving advice and they are given an opportunity to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it is just a catchcry to -attack the Government, which is endeavouring to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to use the land which they have in the Northern Territory - 94,000 square miles - for their own benefit and to develop their own interests and projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I think a man is operating an industry there at the moment and I believe he intends to hand his plant and the whole concern over to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and train them how to do the job so they can get into this very lucrative beef export industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that people have to be prepared to go and help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wilh these projects in the Northern Territory and in such areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People must be prepared to go into these areas and, if it happens to be a buffalo project, train the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> how to operate the project and to run it successfully and how to keep the carcasses scrupulously clean so that they will maintain an export standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People will have to train the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> how to run the mechanics of the whole operation and to stay on the job in their own interests for months at a time and to run the concern for their own benefit as a financial success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you envisage going out into this country, even today when the amenities are somewhat better than they used to be, trying to get organised a  4,000  square mile property with a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are essentially not used to having to work regular and lengthy hours, you would have to fence the area, build yards, build outstations, brand regularly, attend local musters, watch your own boundary fences and look after your water supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This to my way of thinking is the basis of using the land which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to their own benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this area have the determination and ability to run some places on their own, but the point is that the Aboriginal philosophy is such that if one man and his family get onto a block and get a few head of cattle and some water they are obliged to see that their relatives, if they arrive on the verandah or outside the homestead, are watered, fed and cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the main problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have their land and ventures of their own :o organise and run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So to say that nothing is happening with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is quite wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last minute or two I have I would like to refer to something which was mentioned by the Minister for the Environ ment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  - enterprise and thought to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the Apatula housing project which was established at Finke in respect of which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were consulted on what sort of design they wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After some months they came out with a practical design and I note that the Government has made provision for the placing of one of those houses on show so that people can see what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hear mention of the wrong sorts of houses being foisted upon them and about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in houses of a design they do not wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition said that the Government is doing nothing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but there are over 1,000 people in the Northern Territory who are doing something practical for them and who are putting in a tremendous amount of thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is putting in the money and the Minister has introduced into this House a Bill which is designed to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 4 cases that I have thought of just like that where the Government is supplying the know-how and the finance to build these houses to improve the situation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no excuse for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be badly housed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in mentioning the 94,000 square miles or whatever it is in the Northern Territory to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not even run by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  but the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, despite the rejection by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and perhaps in the concept of land rights and the materialistic view of things, we must do something about this in the North. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, my experience from observation leads me to believe that we must at least be prepared to persevere with the Aboriginal people for another 15 to 20 years after we have given the average young Austraiian away because, for all sorts of reasons, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> mature into our view of things at a much later stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been associated with the Federal Council for the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders since its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this variation between the States in their attitudes to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is one of the reasons why the Commonwealth should take full responsibility, and that is one of the reasons why the first point in the amendment should be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment refers to the Government’s refusal to restore land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the paper issued by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  we see a list of houses to be built by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that the South Australian Government, with possibly some assistance from the Commonwealth, has provided improved educational facilities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much was said earlier about angry <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it could be admitted that the South Australia Government has possibly the most progressive ideas in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that we recognise the rights of individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with the Aboriginal society and that we encourage and assist them to develop their culture, languages, traditions and arts so that these can become living elements in the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I ask the honourable member for Fremantle where is the difference between that aim and his aim to encourage the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become a distinctive people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gather that they wish the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to develop as a distinctive people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that mean that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should stay as they are? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it does because one of the parts of the Opposition’s amendment asserts that we should provide more employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that we should be doing more in the field of health so that the standard of health and the way in which health services are provided are similar to the bases of those provided to other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite say that education, health, employment and housing services should all be on those lines, surely they are advocating that in the long run we shall be moving towards one community, preserving distinctive cultures of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but certainly moving in the more material things of life to one common community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more, people who come out of the education system and the more people who ask for the sort of employment that has been mentioned this afternoon, the more changes there are in the fundamental desires of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the essential task of this Government is to maintain a flexible policy towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in order to find out as the years go by how we can achieve those aims that I believe rightly have been set out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot agree more with honourable members opposite when they say that we should be doing much more than has been done in the past to consult directly with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe, for instance, that the way in which the honourable member for Wills suggested consultation should take place - that is through the Federal Council of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders - is the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we have schools for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> only in Redfern and Brisbane? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in conjunction with discussions with the Aboriginal communities, can delineate the sites that are of special and sacred significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and preserve them for all time for the purposes which they desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second point concerns another facet of the recommendations of the Institute, namely that those sites that are of importance historically but not of importance to living <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be treated as sites which all Australians should be encouraged to visit so that they can understand to a greater degree than has been possible in the past the essential aspects of Aboriginal life and tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These sites which have been of significance to the Aboriginal people for 4,000 years bear the same sort of relationship to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as do churches and other sacred areas to other parts of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, in the field of education it was suggested that we should do more towards helping to educate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have those tribes which were nomadic only a few years ago when the honourable member for Fremantle and 1 were on the House of Representatives Select Committee on Voting Rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ceased to be nomadic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason why we give grants to them is that we know that ipso facto if they are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they are poor and they are socially disadvantaged, But there are poor people and socially disadvantaged people who are not <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and precisely the same case for assisting them exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, in the case of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, grants starting at the age of 14 are grants starting too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the intriguing things about this debate today and the earlier one that took place is the way in which there has been an injection in the last  12  or  15  years into debate here of the subject of education and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>  - 2  areas in which  12  or  13  years ago honourable members opposite and in particular their leadership said: ‘We have no responsibility’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The positive discrimination in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through the provision of special scholarships is another area in this vein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Thursday the right honourable gentleman amplified an earlier statement by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts on the subject of impact statements which the Government will require from Commonwealth departments and expect from State governments when questions of the environment and pollution are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>01m for secondary school grants for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; and a further S0.72m for Aboriginal study giants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the other forms of special assistance for education, such as migrant education, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will then be in a position where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can encourage and set examples for their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is a group of old age pensioners and also a group of refugee <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes the population into account - as I believe one should under the Constitution and as the Supreme Court of the United States insists must be done under the American Constitution, from which we have borrowed the same words - the disparity would be still greater because the numbers of electors do not include migrants who are unnaturalised and citizens who are still under 21 years of age and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have not chosen to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put on record my thoughts about the real role of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts in a federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenged it to describe to this Parliament its concept of what should be the concern of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  on 24th May last in which he detailed the Department’s so-called duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts can investigate and write the guidelines to indicate what is environmentally wise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has a key role to play here to ensure that such sell-outs to industry do not occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts gave some leadership in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware that the initial attempts of the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  to enlist the cooperation of the States in a national intrusion, as it were, into this field were not universally acclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we will see that it is not long before the Department of Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts will be working towards national standards for a variety nf things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will realise, the Council is chaired by the Minister for Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, who is at the table, and the several States are represented by the appropriate State Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In examining the functions of the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, I am afraid that its functions are far too nebulous and that they do not give us any clear guidelines as to what we are determining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a more serious note, mention has been made of impact studies carried out by the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman  - [Quorum formed] In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  1  would point out to the honourable member for Sturt who has just left his seat- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course one has to go a long way beyond that in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not different from us, other than in colour and custom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that no-one will think that I am casting a reflection on the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is clear that the Government considers that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are worthy of only a bits and pieces Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are concerned, it is a change for the worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the DLP also would have thrown their weight against any suggestion of land rights for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DLP attitude was made quite clear in an article appearing in the Melbourne Herald’ of 7th August which stated that the DLP at its State conference had rejected a motion calling on the Government to recognise land rights for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is utterly impossible and ridiculous for one Minister to try to handle the several responsibilities that the present Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts has had placed upon him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the best of my knowledge, during the period of 18 months or so that the Minister has held the portfolio he has never visited, let alone made a detailed survey or investigation of the situation, in the north, north-west and north-east of Western Australia where several thousand <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These areas require urgent attention in a general way and not only with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some well-meaning people err in believing that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be treated in the same way, regardless of the part of Australia in which they are living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In certain parts of my own electorate of Kalgoorlie some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt must be remembered that it could well be that before the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> mixed with whites or other people the hygiene question did not have the same significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But today there is a need and to satisfy that need it will be necessary to finance and to equip medical and nursing terms to be operating continually out in the field, teaching and helping the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wherever they are, on stations, in camps, on reserves, or no matter where they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that the matter before the Committee concerns <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the arts and the environment because they represent 3 of the merging issues in Australia about which young people, particularly, are showing a great deal of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently we have heard from the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  who is at the table, that there is to be a manifestation of governmental concern in the form of impact studies and subsequent statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am glad that we have had such a useful series of speeches today and also last Thursday week on the estimates for the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 say to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  that we have an opportunity here to do likewise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members may ask me whether the Legislative Council should take over responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who lives amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> frankly I do not know what the best policy is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory would have his own views as to whether self-government for the Northern Territory should in fact include complete control over the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see this happen in Queensland and in all States of the Commonwealth because I believe that this would be the best way in which the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be looked after from a national point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be preferable to having a proliferation of State and local government laws in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not qualified to speak on that subject, but from mixing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and having lived with them over the years I do know some of their problems and I think this is a national responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the provision of additional finance for the Western Australian State Housing Commission, particularly for the provision of houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a sad reflection of our attitude towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Committee was told that at least $20m was needed to overcome the backlog in housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a humane way of providing homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and at the same time keeping our building workers in full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are training schemes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for national servicemen to whom I referred a moment ago, for those displaced owing to redundancy or replaced by technological change, for women wishing to re-enter the work force, and there is training provided under the rural reconstruction scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Had time permitted I would have referred to housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to flats for migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what the’ Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  would say about this proposal if he were available to participate in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  is sitting on the front bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts interjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  has just come into the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have not been informed in this House whether this property is being purchased on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, on figures that I have revealed already by way of Press statements and so forth, there is a large discrepancy in regard to the purchase price of this property and what later appeared in Press statements and other statements by the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts about this property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its history of treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in South Australia is nothing short of shocking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time these people stood on the then South Australian Government and insisted on a dogproof fence being erected around waterholes and timber on the property and denied access to both water and timber by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family has a long history of bad treatment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that, when the Commonwealth had its options open to acquire the Everard Park property on behalf of the northwest <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in South Australia, the McLachlans went under the neck of the Commonwealth and acquired the property because they did not want to see any reserve or. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>further than that, any land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in areas adjacent to their own properties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should also lay down guidelines as to the future acquisition of properties, suitable of course to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and after consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Department of the Interior to Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal land rights and the attitude displayed by the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts are somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then this matter will be approached on a proper basis and not with interdepartmental jealousies as have occurred over this particular property where the Department of the Interior on the one hand, does not wish to see the property acquired by the Commonwealth and perhaps the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts wants to acquire the property and has to have some considerable interdepartmental argument with the Department of the Interior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall conclude and make 4 minutes of my time available to the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts so that he can answer the questions which I have put to him in regard to the transaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will he tell the do-gooders who have been pressurising bis Department on African and Asian migration to exhaust themselves in doing something practical to help fair dinkum Australians to do something worthwhile for the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who alone have a claim for justice and fair treatment by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-53-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have said in this House, and I did tell a group of people at Perenjori, that there was pot the slightest doubt that members of the Communist Party and communist elements were associated with activist groups among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fighting for land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has declared itself categorically in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but why has it not declared itself with respect to minerals and land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By this I mean that I would hope that there would be a cutting of the Gordian knot bet .seen Canberra and the Northern Territory in relation to a lot of the minor decisions that are made even in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will not, however, permit any State Government or State agency to frustrate the clear will of the Australian people recorded so overwhelmingly in the 1967 Referendum that the national Government should assume constitutional responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among many measures already announced, my Government will give priority to establishing Aboriginal land rights and to ensuring that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are truly equal before the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above that is a discretionary allowance which is actually taken from a similar allowance constructed in relation to allowances for the education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under certain circumstances - that is, $150 for clothing, $50 for books and between $26 and $104 for pocket money according to the age of the child concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a lot to be done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but there are a lot of other people living up there as well and we should also see about their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, we have said: There are areas of concern up there, such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, northern development, minerals and energy, and things of this sort that need to be singled out for special attention.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government intends to press for the establishment of Aboriginal land rights, far better health services and better nutritional standards for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so thu no longer will they be the poverty-stricken section of this Australian community with one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ministers have already embarked upon this course - against Queensland over territorial boundaries and Torres Strait islanders as well as over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and coal export prices, and against Victoria over housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The calculated confrontation with all States over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which is to be found in the Governor-General’s Speech disdains cooperation rather than enhances it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We paved the way for a better deal for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to give them the land rights which they have justly and rightly deserved for a long while and upon which question the previous Government see-sawed and wavered because it was afraid of offending big business in this country, of which it was the servant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other 50 per cent are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> clearly defined amongst themselves, whose attitudes are clearly expressed and who are clearly accepted by their own Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a large number of people in Australia are unemployed it will be found that many of them are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is an area where special attention needs to be offered to minority groups - <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has quite a high proportion of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who because of their background find difficulty in obtaining jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the northern part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question may relate to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the next to the state of the economy and the third one to immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of this has been allocated to legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a time when arguments in favour of voting rights for women and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were also rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electoral officers -  Mr Lee  and the men in that Department - are to be congratulated for the effort they made to educate people, mainly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to be able to vote with  preference  cards listing 6 or 7 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there was a 5 per cent or greater informal vote at the last election, I ask the Ministers responsible for this matter to start now to teach not only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also  young men  and women down to the age of 18, or as the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  suggested, down to the age of 14 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and electors with young children are not uniformly dispersed throughout the various regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister stated in his second reading speech, controls on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as such have been lifted in all States and in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently it is in the nature of a formality that reference to controls on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be removed from Federal legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia ought not to be exploited by persons who merely wish to make money out of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot possibly understand the conditions under which they will be employed outside the Commonwealth, or the experiences they are likely to undergo in a foreign country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be assisted to hold effective and respected places within one Australian society with equal access to the rights and opportunities it provides and acceptance of responsibilities towards it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to choose the degree to which and the rate at which they intend to identify themselves with our Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government we believe must take into account the expressed wishes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and it is our belief that programs of advancement will prove ineffective without the voluntary involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Opposition believes that it is essential that the present Council for Aboriginal Affairs should be replaced by a council comprising <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that Government policy in this area should be designed to encourage and strengthen the capacity of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to manage their own affairs; to increase their economic independence; to reduce their handicaps in health, housing, education, training and employment; and to promote their enjoyment of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conviction that governments must assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to exercise their civil liberties is firmly held by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Australians are equally ignorant of the historical aspects of the settlement of Australia by the Europeans and the catastrophic effects which this has had on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that education can play a significant part in contributing towards a better understanding of the problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our society and effectively assisting in the changing of attitudes which are discriminatory on racial grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution itself restricted the role of this Parliament concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; we have now removed that discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever one turns in Australia, one will find that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are more likely to be punished for the sins to which all humanity seems to be heir. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  findings, however, will be the basis upon which the Commonwealth will act not only in the Northern Territory, not only in the Jervis Bay territory at places such as Wreck Bay, but also in the States where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are still exercising traditional land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are determined to see that there will be non-alienable nontransferable rights vested in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in respect of the land which they have traditionally occupied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very likely that when it has to hand  Mr Justice  Woodward’s report the Commonwealth will exercise its constitutional powers if need be by way of acquisition of these Aboriginal reserves and other relevant lands to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can reasonably claim title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the former Government subsidised family planning for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but not for other Australians, the present Government has already made available $300,000 for the development of family planning in all sections of our community, including those whose interest is restricted to the ovulation method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will consideration be given by the Government to implementing or setting up a national committee to combat racism and racial discriminanon which would include groups from all sections of the community so that as well as educating our black population we can start to educate our white population as to the reasons for the plight of underprivileged groups of people, not only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but other sections of the community such as national groups and ethnic groups? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of Health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and children; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for  younger  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist school leavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important distinction must be made between the problems faced by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in major towns and cities and the problems faced by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on reserves or in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have moved into the major cities has been extremely high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least 30 per cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living in urban centres and consequently increasing emphasis must be placed on programs to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are handicaps in the way of stable employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> then the Department of Labour and State authorities must help to remove those handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in remote areas are concerned, I understand that the majority of them are living in static communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spirit of looking towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for guidance and indeed for direction also is a cardinal one as far as I am concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me return very briefly to the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> deciding primarily the conduct of their welfare or future negotiations between themselves and the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last 2 Prime Ministers, the honourable member for Mackellar and his successor made a number of statements indicating that we must look to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to provide the voice for the pattern of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This thought should be encouraged to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> participate in the management of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises the rights of individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to effective choice about the degree to which and the pace at which they come to identify themselves with that Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians should be generous enough to welcome such diversity if it is  desired by  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know his interest in this subject over a very long period and his record of service to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League in Victoria and the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are sick will go to State hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in his second reading speech, spoke about consultation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conferences were held at Townsville and elsewhere, and the legitimate views of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were sought in quite an honest way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Minister in the McMahon Government the Commonwealth, in its consultations with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, chose to work through people who were appointed as advisers by the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They represented only a little more than one-third of the Aboriginal and Island population of the State - those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who actually lived in communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who attended that conference were invited, irrespective of political considerations, to try to give a broad ranging representative group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the opportunity to tell the Commonwealth the patterns of consultations which should apply in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of gradually expanding the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs and involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Department, particularly in the field, in making contact with Aboriginal and Island communities, in liaison and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our aim must not be ,to further the interests of those people who themselves are trying to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or to further political interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be to further the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that everything that could be done or should be done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are terrible difficulties in this whole program, and 1 think that one of the things which probably the Government appreciates but which may not be appreciated outside this House is that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, and it is quite natural, a feeling among people in the electorates that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are like the people they see in their own town or their own city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course more than half the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are like that, but most of the people who cast their votes for members of this House have scarcely ever seen the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the other end of the spectrum - the people who are still living in tribal or near tribal conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the indigenous <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - I do not mean visitors - there are in Victoria probably no full bloods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By themselves, they are probably what is needed in the main for those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are nearly assimilated, but they are certainly not enough for those who still maintain the traditional way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not trying to say that this has anything to do with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Redfern or the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Footscray or somewhere like that; it has not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has a great deal to do with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the north of Australia and the centre of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said in his second reading speech that he calculated that nearly 90 per cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were living in absolute and acute social depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complaints are made that money is being spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when it ought to be spent for other purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question of providing the necessary money for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider this question we must understand that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in a tribal state have a direct link with the land they occupy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House ought to recognise, and 1 believe it does, the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be a distinctive but not a separate people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of his advisers who arrived in the north very recently to our way of thinking in the Northern Territory are not <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is being told what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want and v/hat they are thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the meeting - and this will cause many more such meetings - is that those who were seen associating with the Minister and who could be advising him do not have the respect of either the Europeans or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment at various centres of both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that the previous Government did a tremendous amount for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to proceed from Unakumba to Angurguru, travel across the top end of Arnhem Land and through to the centre to see what people have done and are doing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to recognise that what <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the critics, a number of whom are churchmen, are accused of dividing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bishop of Darwin, J. P. O’Loughlin, has spent 20 years with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as have many other churchmen in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, on the other side is a list of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These fellows are leaders of thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of Gus Williams from Hermannsburg, who is part-coloured, these men are all full-blooded <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bishop 0’Loughlin was quite right when he said that the problems of the people in northern Australia are entirely different from those of part coloured <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in city suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everard Park, which covers 2,400 square miles, was acquired and returned to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has to get people and money to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to develop this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister probably told the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Yirrkala that they did not have to work at Gove, that they could sit under a tree and that they could do whatever they wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we on this side of the House do not aften agree wilh him I think that those of us who are interested in Aboriginal affairs have recognised that he has shown a concern for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the amount he was charging his fellow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was about $18 a frame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Gwydir electorate has a relatively high population of part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but very few full bloods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are living in my electorate have good jobs, are Jiving with dignity and are highly respected citizens in the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that in New South Wales since  1965  greater efforts than ever before have been made by the present Liberal-Country Party Government to advance the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until recent years there was a lack of social conscience so far as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  knows, there is a problem at Wee Waa among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are mostly itinerant workers on the cotton fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments have moved to help to improve the working and living conditions of the itinerant workers, most of whom are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is representative of all sections of the community, including well known cotton growers who want to see the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> helped and given decent conditions which will allow them to live with at least some sense of dignity and to work under conditions that are acceptable to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moree, my home town, has an acute housing problem for the local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the February  1971  flood about  20  families were moved from the low lying areas surrounding Moree to what is called the Mehi Crescent and were provided with emergency accommodation in caravans, and  16  of those  20  caravans are still providing shelter for approximately  110  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - more than  30  adults and  80  children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More and more funds will be required to provide an increasing population of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this area with adequate housing on an annual basis and to provide more health facilities, adequate pre-school facilities and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not surprising that so many people are concerned about the enormous social problems facing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are strong demands from militant groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their supporters for financial compensation amounting to $6 billion and a percentage of the gross national product per annum to compensate their race for occupancy of land which they claim once belonged to their ancestors and which is now owned by white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how strongly one may work for the Aboriginal cause, one cannot ignore the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot be isolated from the total Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory there are approximately 95,000 square miles of reserves sei aside for the purpose of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no earthly use saying that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory did not accept the principle of the leasehold tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was more important was that on land boards that determined the applications for those leases the Government appointed 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of the 5 board members so that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves were making a decision and taking part in the decision itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has now established the Woodward Commiission to inquire into land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Prime Minister that if the Government introduces new measures or new tenures or titles for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory this principle must also be applied to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no justice at all in making one law for the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and another for dispossessed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, many of whom live in deplorable circumstances in Sydney and in other capital cities have less land available to them than those in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in New South Wales there are only 20 square miles of reserves whereas in the Northern Territory there are 95,000 square miles where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the right to roam, to hunt and to forage over the total area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-alienable non-transferable rights vested in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in respect of the land which they have traditionally occupied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Commonwealth will exercise its constitutional powers if need be by way of acquisition of these Aboriginal reserves and other relevant lands to which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can reasonably claim title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do part <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have equal claim to land on traditional grounds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect, I wish to quote from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment which inquired into the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait islanders and the preservation of their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have contributed enormously to our appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to our understanding of their traditional relationships with the land and the physical features of the countryside around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will also supplement education for Aboriginal children with the teaching of traditional Aboriginal arts, crafts and skills mostly by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the pre-school level and infants school level, and even up to the primary level, there is a great case to be made out for the use in Aboriginal schools in the Northern Territory, particularly in Central Australia, and in Western Australia of the native language where that is current and in use by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transition must be a matter of choice by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my experience I have found that most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, although they do not want to abandon their own language, are anxious to become literate and fluent in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become fluent in normal English, but I do not believe that this means imposing upon them an English curriculum in primary and preprimary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting for one moment that we should not endeavour to get <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are academically capable of taking the higher grades; I am not trying to rule that out for a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does seem to me that the first priority now is to get <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are capable in their own language - the language is crucial - of taking the lower grades in the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have mixed groups which are very difficult and which I believe are not in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be mixture and a breaking down of the tribe then let the initiative come from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would almost hope that in some cases there might be within a limited framework some kind of re-sorting of the tribal situations, again not forcing it, but allowing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to choose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the scheme as a way of encouraging <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be interested in teaching their own children in their own areas so that the children will grow up with respect for and knowledge of their own circumstances and traditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> enter our way of life it would be a great pity if they entered it without having any chance of knowing about their traditions, background and arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House ought to pay tribute to much of the pioneering work that was done by the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  in the original efforts to gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it might be useful for this House if the Minister asks his officers to document what has been attempted, the successes that were achieved and the failures that resulted from some of the efforts in that area, not restricting the examination of the paper to what has occurred at Katherine but including other examples where special efforts have been made to solve some of the problems of education and of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the wider community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One item to which we could raise no objection is the appropriation of $10m for the advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides an appropriation of $10,850,000 to be allocated to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account to improve the health, education and housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to make legal representation available to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who appear as defendants in courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the right for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have an equal opportunity to avail themselves of the benefits provided by the Public Defender on the same basis as Europeans is long overdue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some years ago the Australian people by referendum expressed overwhelmingly the view that more should be done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I admit that the previous Government had shown some endeavour to aid <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I am joyfully pleased that my Party in Government is making a more determined effort to relieve the plight of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another college is to be built for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> near Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government believes that sufficient was not being done by the previous Government and we are endeavouring to meet the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whose problems are a legacy, one might say, of our great-great-grandfathers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not so long ago, in 1962, we passed an Act which gave <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the right to vote, but no citizen guarantee in the Constitution gave them that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It specifies, in effect, that the representations shall be in relation to the numbers of people; that is, the total population of the States including children, migrants and - since 1967  -  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Difficulties are associated with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget the people that a government should set out to represent, whether they be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living on the bank of the Darling River or struggling farmers living on the Namoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the most important matters which the Committee will be discussing will involve many social problems in the Northern Territory, problems such as education and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and problems intrinsic to the Northern Territory such as land tenure, mining leases and other related matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>T believe that it will be a committee of a non-party political nature from which the people of the Northern Territory will derive great benefit, particularly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who will be saved from exploitation in the fields on which I put my greatest emphasis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Welfare must be taken into consideration - the welfare of the people of the north and of our original Australians, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who have a special claim for attention and consideration by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise tonight to say that that man did the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Europeans in that area and of the people who are trying to bring these 2 groups together - the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  the Minister for Education  (Mr Beasley)  and all of us - a great disservice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether honourable members - 1 am speaking now not of migrants but of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - saw recently on television a backlash from towns in the Northern Territory about what was being done for our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am entirely in favour of differential treatment for the advantage of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member cited the case of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that a few weeks ago during the second reading stage of an earlier social services Bill he expressed concern about what he seemed to feel was the generosity in regard to unemployment and sickness benefits, specifically unemployment benefits, going to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal problems of social maladjustment come in fact from cultural clash, from long term neglect of the needs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within our society, from the way in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been repressed and discriminated against and the way in which their needs have not been attended to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After leaning over the door of his car he pointed at the Crossways Hotel in Katherine and said: ‘And the whites are over there in their $2m Crossways Hotel planning their strategy, working out what they are going to do in their air conditioned rooms, while the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are across the high level bridge over the Katherine River’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is making the job of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  who is sitting at the table, far harder than it would otherwise be because this program endeavoured to paint a picture and excluded from the scene anyone who happened to be interested in the welfare of Australian citizens whether they be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not have time to go through them all but some of them were: The running of educational, health and job opportunity functions of the Department; the running of settlements at Hooker Creek, Beswick and Roper River - these places are in the local area and naturally enough the people would be interested in them; the allocation of funds to the Department and the way they are expended; the questioning of the lack of supervision of the spending of welfare cheques paid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for specific purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this reporter did not wish to portray this genuine interest in the welfare of the people in the area, not only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also whites on the settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment at various centres of both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and whites was another of the terms of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has done a great disservice to the people who are trying to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He lured them across the high level bridge ostensibly to be seen speaking to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in camp environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those who go to the area and write news stories and take pictures have to understand that they can help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as well as we can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This belief was put forward on the sole argument - a very questionable on and one which seems to reveal certain biases he has - that it would destroy the moral fibre and the drive for self-improvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also is concerned with other activities on behalf of the Government in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 do not suggest as a Minister has suggested that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be sterilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there has been no comparable organised campaign against the atrocities committed in Vietnam, against capital punishment, against nuclear testing in the Pacific or against an infant mortality rate amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that is 17 times higher than for the general community, one can be excused for thinking that among those who now campaign so strongly against abortion law reform there are many who have a great feeling for foetal life but once it stops being a foetus their respect for human life stops well short of that concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this campaign for abortion has proceeded, it is notable that concern for child endowment, maternity welfare, reduction of neo-natal, infant and child mortality of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have all been played off the stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At 31st December 1972 there were approximately 7,550 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in communities conducted by Church Missions in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ Petition to the United Nations (Question  No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be looking in particular to the National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Consultative Council, when it becomes fully operative, to advise me on further action which might be taken in relation to the matters referred to in the petition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts approved in principle the recommendations in the report and indicated that the Government would provide funds for their implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Particular attention is being given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to women in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the operations of the Commonwealth Employment Service, what is involved is drawing up guide lines to eliminate the discriminatory practices associated with notifying and filling job vacancies; for example, where employers specify that only men should be referred to fill vacancies which could be filled by women, or specify that they do not want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as we have embarked on a determined campaign to restore the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their rightful place in Australian society, so we have an obligation to remove methodically from Australia’s laws and practices all racially discriminatory provisions and from international activities any hint or suggestion that we favour policies, decrees or resolutions that seek to differentiate between peoples on the basis of the colour of their skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To help overcome some pockets of poverty amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and others in rural Australia, will the Minister continue- ‘indeed, step up - the previous Government’s policy of providing regional offices of his Department in rural areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that there is a very serious problem of poverty, and indeed, a serious health problem among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nursing sisters are unable to treat patients without the supervision of a doctor, as it is contrary to medical professional practices and nursing training, lt would, therefore, also be of detriment to the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and the Ministry will noi provide a second-rate service to Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure that Minister that almost any sort of health care service for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be better than the service available to them at present in Nowa Nowa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) How were the Northern Territory representatives to the recent National Conference of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Canberra selected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-117-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that the teaching of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own language has already commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the teachers will be asked to get through to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the importance of respecting their environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>it through to the young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans that they must respect the environment because we see it ruined from top to bottom by people of various ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear so much about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the areas in which they have lived and which are sacred to them but one has to go there to see the devastation which a tribe or a gathering of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can cause in any one area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would also like to make a comment on some of the observations of the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Very often we think that we will teach <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our categories of thought instead of in their own categories of thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member will know, some very interesting experimental work is being done in Alice Springs at the present time on the question of how to really communicate with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to find out not merely whether they know English but whether, when matters are discussed with them in one’s own thought categories, in fact anything is being conveyed at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that some psychological advantage has been achieved, in the respect that is being shown for their languages for the first time, in trying to teach the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own languages with Aboriginal teachers or teaching aids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall how the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  as Prime Minister and my predecessor in Casey, as Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts endeavoured, in the parlance of the day, to de-Gortonise this project along with many other projects in a manner that was highly disruptive to the unity of the Liberal Party and damaging to its electoral prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 8 September 1971 the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts said in answer to a question without notice from the honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley): <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>within recent weeks I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, and I have pointed out to him that he is to proceed as quickly as possible to collect all the evidence that becomes available to him so that the proposal can be presented to the Government well before the next Budget and not necessarily therefore in a Budget context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To have heard the then Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts talk at the time one might have supposed that Australia had no film industry and that there would have been no opening for the graduates of the school other than in our limited number of television studios. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those honourable members in the House who wanted to have a little morning doze would have been indebted to the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews)  for his monotonous, archaic monologue which seemed to be devoted more primarily to taking apart the former honourable member for Casey who was Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main problems we have in Australia at the present time are poverty, inequality and the under-privileged members of our society, particularly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These facts illustrate clearly the Midas touch of failure which Victorian governments bring to all their dealings with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of East Gippsland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In choosing to ignore this advice and instead to hand over Lake Tyers to a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> described by their own representative in the Victorian Parliament as having ‘at best extremely limited experience in or knowledge of farming operations and probably a complete absence of knowledge of the more vital problems of farm economies’, the Victorian Government showed a cynical disregard for the cause of Aboriginal land rights to which its spokesmen at the same time were paying lip service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government raised expectations both among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and in other sections of the community which it knew could not be satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the 7-man Lake Tyers committee of management has fallen from 5 to 2, and great difficulty is being experienced in finding replacements for those who have resigned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More than half the 36 adult <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> resident at present on the Lake Tyers property are living on social security payments or waiting for approval as social security beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The aspirations, determination and self-respect of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Lake Tyers, no less than the health of Aboriginal children throughout East Gippsland- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been sacrificed to the dogma that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must run before they have finished learning to walk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas frequent false alarms have made the Bairnsdale ambulance service reluctant to visit Lake Tyers in response to calls from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, it is th, policy of the Victorian Ministry that such calls should not be made on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not from a book or a film but from grim experience that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Lake Tyers have learned the meaning of ‘Catch-22’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is symbolised by the Ministry sending out its officials to buy back from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the shares with which they were issued only 2 short years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shares in the Lake Tyers Aboriginal Trust acquired in recent months by the Victorian Ministry for Aboriginal Affairs must now be reassigned to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who can make good those deficiencies in skills and expertise and leadership by which the Trust has so far found itself crippled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must take into account the effects of mining on the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, on the environment and pollution and the rights of those people who work in and around the mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of its increased expenditure I heartily applaud, in particular that on pensions, on education, on the cities, and on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia the likely members of such an under-class are mainly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, deserted wives and widows with young families, pensioners and large low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because there have been heavy commitments to the easing of the means test, to education and to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is consistent with the large percentage increases that have taken place throughout the whole of Australia, whether it be on education, housing, social services, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, money spent on the cities through the Department of Urban and Regional Development or public transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a major proportion of the Northern Territory’s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question by saying that over a period of years disturbing reports have appeared in the Press concerning conditions in such prisons as Fannie Bay gaol, particularly affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One minor one which has not been acted on, but which I hope will be, is the concessional rate of duty on plug tobacco sold to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It began in 1935 ostensibly to help the tobacco industry and depends on 2 requirements, firstly, that the tobacco is of low quality and, secondly, that it is supplied to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand it has about it an air of paternalism which appears to be entirely out of keeping with the approach of the present Government to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ problems: on the other hand it involves the provision to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on ‘subsidised’ terms of a clearly inferior product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The various other forms of financial and other assistance now being provided to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> render the concession as unnecessary as it is offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received a telex message that carries the advice that the Sydney based Sutton group of companies has bought Tipperary station for $5.4m and that the sale is associated with an arrangement that was previously being entered into with the Tipperary group of companies over a dispute with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who claim cattle rights in the Daly River area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only unusual feature I am aware of is the relationship to the sale of that arrangement that existed between Tipperary and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Daly River area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cover everyone in the community and it will not fail as the present scheme does in respect of low income earners and the fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can follow the efforts of the PostmasterGeneral in this case to equate these things as he sees it, but I ask him: Does his Government, for instance, see fit, rightly, to give extra help to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly concerned by the suggestion voiced in some quarters that the Government should intervene, directly and arbitrarily, to prohibit certain betrothal and marriage customs, or aspects of them, and even to disallow or abrogate arrangements which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have entered into amongst themselves, simply because the customs or arrangements are distasteful or repugnant to our ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nearly always the case that incidents of this kind occur in communities which continue to live to a substantial extent in accordance with tradition although, as I will mention later, there is evidence that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> widely are beginning to adapt that tradition, voluntarily, to their changed circumstances of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Polygyny was apparently never universal amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the sense that every man had more than one wife at a time, or even in the course of a lifetime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not simply because the Christian missions, as they are entitled to, expect their adherents to be monogamists, but because there is a distinct shift of sentiment amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, especially the younger ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as it is a problem it will be dealt with by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own way and in all probability will in time disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main point I desire to make is that most of the circumstances allowing or encouraging polygyny have changed, and that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> widely realise that this is the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly runs counter to some of our most cherished ideas, but many people who worry themselves about so-called child marriage do not realise the extent to which this misrepresents the Aboriginal custom, and even insults the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who in some ways could teach us a lesson or two about the care of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> describe as the promise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am doing is to suggest that meddlesome and morally censorious interference by us is not the answer to a tradition which a great many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, especially in the more traditional areas, still uphold strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it very interesting and significant that a recent congress of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory decided, of their own motion, that promises of long standing would continue to be honoured but that in future young men and women would be free to marry by choice provided they kept the other laws of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, I and my Department will discuss them with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned with the utmost patience and goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The life that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> lead might well be austere, but to assume that they ill-treat children is quite wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reticence of the previous Government may have been due partly to shame but probably more likely it was due to indifference, particularly over the statistics concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> constitute only 26 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory but they make up 56 per cent of the gaol population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  said that the Australian Government would assume ultimate responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and would establish a Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs, with offices in each State to give the Commonwealth a genuine presence in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I query its capability to speak on the welfare of all Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, seeing that virtually all of this committee was nominated by the Minister and drawn from the ranks of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, except for a few other reputable people, who, in the opinion of a number of people, were appointed for window dressing purposes only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he hand picked the organisers of this committee, for again there seems to be a large number of members of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders appointed as such, and this organisation, as we all know, was presided over by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were regarded as rural pests and an obstruction to what is called development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when Aboriginal reserves were established towards the end of the 19th century they were leased not to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but to Government departments or religious missions on the assumption that they could best judge the most appropriate form of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change from the assumption that our society is entitled to expect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the supreme flattery of imitation has been very slow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the referendum which brought the Commonwealth into the field of policy the then Prime Minister, the right honourable John Gorton, expressed a view which acknowledged that Aboriginal Australians may have different views about the pace at which assimilation is to take place but the objective remained unchanged and the conviction that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would, in due course, desire it is re-emphasised by the following statement by him: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must be helped to take an increasing part in the management of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say further that well conceived programs designed by social scientists and administrators have failed because their clients, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, have been involved only as passive recipients and, at most, have been invited to endorse programs already approved for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one wonders what programs, if any, have been evolved for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He found the same thing applied to education in that only a handful of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> he reported on had reached the top classes in secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister reported that 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in some towns are unemployed and are living on unemployment benefit, social benefits and handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support everything the Minister said with regard to the conditions under which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those areas are living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may therefore ask: Where has this large amount of money - the amount of $259m which has been provided by the Commonwealth and the States for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - been spent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable P. Howson, as the then Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, in a debate in Parliament on 14 September 1972 set out the number of organisations which had been set up to care for the welfare of the Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are approximately 160 organisations in Australia looking after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the Aboriginal is very fortunate because each of those organisations presumably is really dedicated to doing its best for the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only as a result of the passing of the referendum, and it will be only as a result of the passing of this legislation that the Commonwealth will have some say in the future with regard to the management and control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that situation is related to the previous Administration which was in power for 23 years and had control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that they are working in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the referendum of 1967 was that the Australian Government should assume responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One only has to be a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and to have a look at the conditions under which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living at present to realise the importance of the Standing Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner the provisions of this Bill can be brought into operation, Australian Government control established and some sense of sanity and goodness achieved for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is better liaison, very often, between State departments when the matter being dealt with concerns the health, education or housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are missing a chance for their children to get a better start in life, especially if they do not wish to care for them in their early years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a pity if the present case breaks down this sort of feeling between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conclusion of the sale the members of the Borroloola Social Club, who are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, had to be instructed on what had occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not know what was going on; they were told later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech, the Minister stated that some confusion existed among Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as to whom they should approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it truly representative of all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> across the nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is happening with regard to the election which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are supposed to be holding to put Aboriginal members on to that Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What thoughts has the Minister about the complaint from many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the outback areas of Western Australia, Queensland or the Northern Territory - I say this reservedly - that they are being bulldozed into accepting the decisions which come from this Council and which purports to represent them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say that they are being bulldozed into agreement by the better educated part-coloured city slickers, as it were, who come into their areas and are used as mouthpieces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> really understand what is meant by transferring authority from the States to the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Someone must advise the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy being espoused in Australia for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is quite separate and distinct from that followed with respect to European Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all means let us work towards assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to take their place in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> participate in the fruits of the development of this tremendous country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government embarked on a course which will bring <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to that desirable state? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Government working together to achieve that end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless something is done the whole onward movement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> towards involvement in their own enterprises will go down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say to the Minister: Do not turn your back on those who can assist you and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should be training men and women who can assist the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to develop their own skills and to develop their own determination to work for themselves in order to enable them to own and operate a considerable part of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a matter of lining up the people with the experience and trying to teach the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> until they have reached the stage where they can cope for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was directly under the control of the then Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts but the 2 previous speakers on the Opposition side said they know nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time somehow it was announced that the new Labor Government had bought the Baptist Theological College in the Brisbane suburb of Hill End for the purpose of a hostel for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Australian’ newspaper - perhaps the Queensland edition - on 30 July reported that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not being consulted by the Federal Government over the use of hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the Black Community Service advised that ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were angry that the Federal Government had reserved the Hill End hostel for girl workers and not students as originally proposed’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we all realise that whilst the Torres Strait Islanders are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the strict interpretation of the word, they are proud to retain their own identity as Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Howson,  the former honourable member for Casey, was the Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, government policy was to liaise with the organisations set up in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Herbert, in criticising the proposal for the establishment of a national <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> consultative council, did not take into account what has actually happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier in the year the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs brought together a representative group of people who had been involved in Aboriginal affairs He asked them to recommend the manner in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could be consulted in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They suggested to him in 2 conferences in Canberra, and in a number of regional conferences, that an elected national <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> consultative council be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter has involved a great number of discussions and I am told that more than 2,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have attended regional conferences to discuss it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its day that department managed the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the cradle to the grave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the Commonwealth Employment Service it selects and offers pre-employment training to young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who might be short on skills but show that they are not afraid to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely we ought to be encouraging anything that enables <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be given a better life than living on unemployment benefits or on subsistence agriculture or fishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officer also said that he experienced very great difficulty in getting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to apply for work previously and that it would be quite impossible now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to sneer at paternalism and say that paternalism is a bad thing, but just to wash one’s hands of the problem /because of the unpopularity that comes with authority and to let things drift along is to buy popularity at the expense of the well being of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the same rights as other people to obtain drink, but, in view of the way in which the drink problem is destroying them, the price of being popular in the general community is a very dear one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for the Government to say that it will buy popularity by giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This willingness to sacrifice the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the altar of political popularity is one of the things about which I am acutely anxious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion - I have been asked to be brief - I add that it is no good thinking that the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be buried under a mountain of money, because they will fester there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good thinking that the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be washed away in a torrent of eloquence, because they will still be there when the speeches are finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One senses the .morale and notices the different way in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> approach things compared with what they did 12 months or even 10 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question may be about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the next question about prices, the following question on the post office at WOOP WOOP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that about 90,000 people are in the Northern Territory and a third of them are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 go on record as saying that there is no doubt as to his experience with and genuine concern for Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the future success of Government policies will be facilitated by a greater understanding of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, their history, their culture and their contemporary problems by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I believe that the development of a greater understanding of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is important I would put the following suggestions for consideration by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be some advantage for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in legislation of this type where there is provision for the investigation of complaints and for conciliation procedures such as exist in the United Kingdom and New Zealand legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition recognises the rights of individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dual policy which seeks to inculcate and maintain a pride in Aboriginal identity, tradition and culture while providing bridging assistance into Australian society such as legal and medical services, operates on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but not on the white Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to be assisted towards accepting the values and social structures of our society there must be an equal emphasis on policies designed to create acceptance and understanding of this by white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless greater emphasis is directed towards the public understanding of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> most of the increased financial assistance provided in the Budget will not have the most productive results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many migrant groups experience substantially similar problems to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason to prevent the sponsorship of councils along similar lines for the benefit of both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the urban dwellers most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in South Australia are located in the electorates of Wakefield, Grey and to a lesser extent Angas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the western and northern <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reside in my electorate and I should like to see something done for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Port Augusta has been accepted by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as the centre of this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What usually happens is that after a period in this reserve the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be moved into houses provided by the South Australian Housing Trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Port Augusta a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> calling themselves the Aboriginal Social Club has done a fantastic job, thanks to money allocated by the Commonwealth Government and with the assistance of the local council in purchasing an old house and transforming it into a social club wherein the group has provided facilities for Aboriginal old folk, including a television room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> make a go of life, are able to hold down steady jobs, move into the town itself, become part of it and merge into community life no publicity results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land around this area is sacred to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can appreciate the significance of these Ranges to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very fortunate that some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are full time teachers on the staff of the Education Department of South Australia are from that area and, as such, are able to teach the children in their own language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Minister for his sake and so that when he does get a chance to reply to my comments - I imagine that that will be tomorrow - he will have it clearly in his mind that he stated on 23 June that the proposed hostel at Hill End would provide study facilities and a respectable place for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times - I know that the honourable member for Cook  (Mr Thorburn)  is interested in this area - we have looked at the program being conducted through the New South Wales Housing Commission to provide homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there is a lot to be said for building homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through an instrumentality that caters for the housing needs of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we should embark on a program of positive discrimination in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this generation in order that they may have equality in the next generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on that settlement at that time banned him from the settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the affair at this moment at Utopia Station where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are pressuring the owners to sell it to them and threatening that if they do not sell the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will acquire the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Minister knows about them, but from the public relations aspect of Europeans and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living together in the country as Australian citizens, all these sorts of things are leading to a very serious state of affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being told or led to believe that they may expect almost anything they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an expectancy cult, if I could call it that, and someone has to put to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that a reasonable approach has to be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that it now has 2,500 cattle on it and it will be built up and run for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get Utopia it too will run down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be trained and people should be provided to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> run the properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is spending millions of dollars on the purchase of cattle stations and at present the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are threatening the pioneers who own another one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could not get the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they stuck to giving legal aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they probably would be all right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have lived there peaceably with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for 20, 30 or 40 years, but the present Government’s policy is pulling us apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am always interested to listen to the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  but particularly in a debate on Aboriginal affairs because I think one can truly say that there are more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in his Territory than in any other part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vesteys worked <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for those hours and it paid them about 30 bob a month or a very small wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see things, sometimes we have gone a little too fast in trying to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The education should be based to a great extent on films shown to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at a very early age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These generators could be used on the outlying missions to teach <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at an early age the benefits and the dangers of electricity and the use of electrical appliances so that when they come to the city they will not be so bewildered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that all this was in the mind of the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, now the Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant),  because he raised the matter with me and said that he would invoke the potential of the Department of Supply, particularly the valuable material that it sells at its auctions, with a view to lifting the standards of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to an all time high at a minimum cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be given more assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government stepped up its aid to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who is presently in the chamber, would like to have done much more for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during his term as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had other members of his Tory party allowed him to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise he would have done much more for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that in the olden days there were shooting expeditions on Saturday or Sunday afternoons, when Europeans went out and shot down the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> like foxes or other vermin in our countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It pains this generation to read about what previous generations did to our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are conflicts in the opinions of the greatest experts who have made very deep studies of how to lift up the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about doing something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not appear to be any clearly defined policy, or should I say clearly defined method of applying the Government’s policy of assistance to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything he said added up to saying that nothing should be done about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that they should be left as they are, that they have been happy in the past and we should let the old way continue, that we should not think about giving them cattle stations to run, that we should not think of spending money on them and that we should treat them as simple, innocent people who occasionally get drunk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of them are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a government spends money on pensions, on industry, on welfare or on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the department concerned should program its expenditure so that it accounts for its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister became alarmed at the weakness of his Department when it was agreed on 4 September that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs would take over the responsibility for the housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at the national park structure it seems strange in view of the make-up of many of our national parks that there is very litle involvement of indigenous <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the conduct of these great tourist attractions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that we will see in the life of this Parliament a much greater involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the running of these projects because these people have their own dignity, they have their own distinction and they have their own feeling for these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that he put his heart and soul into improving the conditions and the opportunities afforded to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some have only 20 or 30 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and some of them have a thousand or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all colleagues opposite will say: These people are not real <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some terms about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were used during the course of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not mention them, but on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I say to honourable members: Please do not use derogatory terms in debates about Aboriginal people or anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say to that is: ‘If it is not a ghetto for Baptists, it is not a ghetto for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand the facts are that the cattle population on properties taken oyer by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is not all that much different from what it used to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently the Minister was discussing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their drinking problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Adams, and had such experienced and knowledgeable men on it as  Mr Haynes  Leader, the Reverend Paul Albrecht, who is head of the Lutheran Church in the Northern Territory and who was born and bred in the Northern Territory and has vast experience with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the alcohol situation, and  Mr Claude  Narjic, a full-blooded Aborigine from Port Keats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently, I was in Alice Springs, which is the home town of the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  and in a hotel there I saw a fracas taking place between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year or the year before in this Parliament in a similar debate to this the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  pointed out in regard to this question of drunkenness among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory that there were almost no prosecutions against licencees of liquor houses for selling liquor or serving liquor to a drunken person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like him to tell the House when he speaks how many prosecutions have taken place against the liquor interests in the Northern Territory in the last six or twelve months or the last three or four years for serving drunken persons and, in particular, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two friends of mine in whose integrity I have complete faith were working on an Aboriginal mission about 40 miles from Katherine when the previous Government rightly increased social service payments to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They informed me that on the day the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> received their social service cheques, there was a fleet of taxis from Katherine lined up outside this mission to take them into Katherine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not a mission it is a place where a large body of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to drink under the supervision of their superiors, there would be less chance of them indulging in gross offensive behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the 2 dedicated Ministers at the table, the Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant)  and the Minister for Secondary Industry  (Mr Enderby),  will heed what I am saying in connection with this question because I intend to propound in the Parliament, in my Party room and wherever I get an audience that will listen to me the shocking exploitation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory by the liquor interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take seriously what the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has said and I believe that there is a good deal of substance in his alarm at the incursions of liquor among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, on the whole the position in the Northern Territory in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is not getting better; I think that on the whole it is getting worse and, unhappily, the reason for this is the great increase in the amount of liquor and drunkenness among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Enderby)  in a debate on the estimates earlier this afternoon mentioned a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were in gaol for drunkenness and he said  -  1 felt some sympathy with what he said - that perhaps the recourse to drink was a natural reaction by people who felt that their dignity had been taken from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand how the breakdown in the normal social values among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory has led to the kind of despair which prompts them to take refuge in drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as he knows there would be visits to the places where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are congregated by what are called ‘flagon wagons’ carrying bottles of cheap wine which, in terms of intoxicating effect, give much more per dollar spent than do beer or spirits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened afterwards is not known to me by personal experience because I was no longer the Minister and I have not been to the mission since, but I have heard some secondhand accounts - I will not vouch for them absolutely because they are secondhand and, as I have said, I have not had them from official files or from personal experience - that the experiment went very well for a year or so, and then unhappily it started to break down because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> left the lighter and the restricted drinks and went back to the spirits which they could obtain legally by the bottle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the saddest things about the campaign for Aboriginal rights has been the emphasis which so many professional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have put on drinking rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the columns of the newspapers one will see reports claiming discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because they are not being allowed to drink as freely as does everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when one examines the cases one finds usually - not always, but usually - that this claim of discrimination has been raised against the publican because he has refused to serve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have had perhaps a little too much to drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot give him the specific figures for which he asks, but I would agree with him that the major problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory is drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in the Northern Territory when various people, who were members of the Committee for the Rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait islanders - the former Minister was one - and various other interested bodies were ramming very hard for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to have equal rights with Europeans to drink alcohol, to go into bars and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time there was some control over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> drinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, the old-timers, will tell you that flagon wine is the big problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had 25 years experience with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which does not seem to be wanted by the present setup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was there when we discussed it with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, so I do not know where the honourable member is getting his information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who can now buy cars and so on - it is quite right that they should be able to do so- drive to the hotel, get the grog themselves and run the flagon wagons themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is not just the Europeans; it is the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this will always be taken to mean that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have a right to have an education in their own language and culture, which we are attempting to give them for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report goes on to deal with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and drunkenness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that board of inquiry were  Mr Haynes  Leader, a well known former magistrate in the Territory and Pastor Paul Albrecht, bom in the Territory and head of the Finke River Aboriginal Mission set up in central Australia, who would know far more about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their drinking problems than some imported American and some academic professor from Sydney, no matter what their legal qualifications might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard so much from the Minister for the Northern Territory and the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on who fills the gaols in the Northern Territory and that 56 per cent of the 75 per cent of the Northern Territory inmates who are imprisoned for offences against the liquor laws are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; this is quite right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The complaint was that there were no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being employed in these positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further interesting point mentioned in the report on this subject is the suggestion that there ought to be a permanent Aboriginal spokesman to serve as an interpreter for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are charged before courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A permanent interpreter would be dealing every day with criminal cases involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the decision - I think a wise decision - that was taken recently to set up a national advisory council for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> one would be forgiven if he deduced that the Council for Aboriginal Affairs is redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us on this side of the House is any less convinced of the need to take positive action and to spend money to help overcome the difficulties of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to enable them to take their proper place in the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Table 6 discloses that $1.5m will be spent on legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of notoriety that it was impossible to establish any contact with the Queensland Government over questions concerning the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any truth whatever in the statements made by that senator, then it should attract the attention of this House to see whether we can improve matters for the sake of the public, for the sake of the public purse and for the sake of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who may not be benefiting as much from expenditure from the public purse as they would be if we had a Minister whom we could hold fully responsible for everything that was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year $180m is to be spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not all of it for projects of the type to which I have been referring, but a great proportion of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program for which the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  was originally responsible in no small measure involved trusting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the maximum possible extent to manage their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has advanced money, as the previous Government did, to Aboriginal organisations which seemed to have a cohesive element, a constitution and a program that looked worthwhile, in order to allow them to spend the money in the interests of the Aboriginal people and in accordance with the priorities that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be a great increase in expenditure on the education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrant children and isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly pleasing, I feel, are the proposals for assisting special groups such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrant children, soldiers children and isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention has been drawn not only to the article in that newspaper but also to an announcement by a gentleman, I think named  Mr Clapperton,  that he had a league which was dedicated to the white purity of the nation based on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which seemed to me to be an extraordinary exercise in acrobatics and semantics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member should go through Hansard and see how often he voted for the guillotine and the gag and constantly refused to let my colleagues and I discuss everything from social services and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very clearly problems will arise if we try to interfere and direct that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> shall not spend their social security benefits in the same way as other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that that is not the only part of Australia in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are living under similar conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I ought to concede that when the honourable member for Mackellar raised this matter earlier in the year I expressed some scepticism of bis reports about the effects of the payments of these benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem is worrying many people, including anthropologists, sociologists and people generally who are concerned about the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very few <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on these reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The permitted misuse and wastage of funds within that Department all flow over to the judgment which we were asked to cast on this Government’s performance in foreign relations, and last week all members of this Parliament were greeted with screaming and frankly dissatisfied <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An area of some 55 acres would be available as a grand forecourt to Parliament where people could assemble, gather and camp for reasonably short durations in order to press their cause, as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are camping on the lawns opposite Parliament House are doing at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there was plenty of evidence which showed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have lived in the area for a long number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally I can see no reason why Ranger should not go ahead and provided that the claims of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protected with respect to both compensation and rights, I can see no reason also why Nabarlek should not go ahead in those areas with those qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I make the point - I think that this was implicit in what the honourable member for Scullin said - that the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this area should be preserved at all costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware - I speak after having talked to people who have some knowledge of the Ayers Rock situation - the significance of Ayers Rock itself to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was very great, particularly to the western desert people, but is now much less important because of its desecration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult and it will be very difficult to reconcile the interest of tourism so-called with those of the Aboriginal involvement and the significance to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government granted special licences to the Torres Strait <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to export turtles and turtle meat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and electors with young children are not uniformly dispersed throughout the various regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thinks, of course, of the interests of our Aboriginal people in the north, and one hopes that the policy which the former Government implemented of involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the advantages of development will be continued and maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1965 and 1967, before and after the last referendum - on the nexus with the Senate and also on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - the ACT Advisory Council passed a series of resolutions seeking voting right for ACT residents at referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Barmera Hospital has to cope with both of the groups I have mentioned and, furthermore, must cope with itinerant <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> coming in from further afield. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of this average, 5.51 is accounted for by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the total number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area, it means that one Aborigine out of every 30 in the area is in that hospital every day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the daily average of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has increased from 3.05 last year to 5.51 for the first 4 months of this year, the hospital has a problem because of non-payment of hospital dues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that this hospital has worked very hard to try to make sure that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are admitted to the hospital are properly signed up in regard to their hospital benefits but in spite of this there exists a tremendous problem in terms of the amounts of money owing over quite a period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those passed related to Senate elections - submitted in 1906; State debtssubmitted in 1910; again State debts - submitted in 1928; social services - submitted in 1947; and the more recent one concerning the counting of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in reckoning our population, which was submitted to the people in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw an example of this in 1967 when 2 questions, one dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the other with the breaking of the nexus between the numbers in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, were posed at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people were in favour of the question relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but were against breaking the nexus between the 2 Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few days ago the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that his Government would be proud if its record in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was remembered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did take  Dr Coombs  overseas with me on one occasion and used his services on an irregular basis on several other occasions particularly in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the greatly increased capital, recurrent and library grants which will apply to almost all students, there will be extra millions of dollars in each of these and other aspects of education for those in disadvantaged schools - children of lower income families, many migrants with low incomes and language and social adjustment problems, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and children living in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reservations we hold have been caused by the recent allegations of misuse of public funds set aside for the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and islanders and by the report of expenditure which was tabled on 11 October last by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was under the impression that there were no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just what return can be expected from these enterprises for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to warrant such expenditure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who authorised the expenditure of $35,000 to hold a national seminar of Aboriginal arts, $23,500 to stage the 1973 national <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Day celebration and $19,000 for the October football carnival? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance I am not talking about the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to live in dwellings of their own design, but I am speaking about the fringe dwellers, as we call them, and those who rent premises in a town or city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I would like to say is that the grants made to many of the organisations which he quoted were, from my own personal knowledge, approved by  Mr Peter  Howson, the former Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great deal of talk about handouts to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly believe that, to the maximum extent possible, housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be built by authorities that build houses for the whole of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not subscribe to the idea that we should have special authorities building houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, except in those very isolated or exceptional circumstances in which there seems to be no better solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see in the programs for succeeding years some provision for the training in the building industry of young <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who show a capacity for this area of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when I talk about building through organisations such as housing commissions which cater for the needs of the whole community, I am not unmindful of the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> everywhere do not wish to live in housing commission type houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need to design special types of houses - I know that the word ‘transitional’ is a dirty word in relation to housing, but it need not be - to cater for the particular needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to suit the degree of transition that they have made from their own traditional environment to living in the broader Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was happy to learn in conversations with officers of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs recently that the contracts which are being let for sewerage and water supply in these communities require that preference in employment shall be given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders who live in these communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearer home, if one goes to the electorate which the  Speaker  represents which covers the suburb of Redfern in Sydney - not a wealthy area and an area which is predominantly Labor - he will find a white backlash against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me briefly say something about, the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and mention 2 matters which may seem peripheral and trivial but which I think are important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Kalokerinos  corrected this deficiency by administering quite massive doses of this vitamin to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, if one goes to the area in western New South Wales where much of this vitamin deficiency is said to occur amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, one finds, along the Darling River, the capacity to grow citrus fruits of the very highest quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister announced an intention to establish a consultative group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from all parts of Australia which was to advise him on programs and policies for Aboriginal advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All matters with regard to health, education and housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> remained as they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when one considers this amount and discusses it with officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the State Ministers who control Aboriginal affairs and the various organisations that play a part with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, one realises that $170,478,000 spent over the 5 years, in view of the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the outlandish places where they live - I refer to the farflung places - and the problems they had with the Government trying to better their conditions, was not all that much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change from the assumption that our society is entitled to expect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the supreme flattery of imitation has been very slow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to what was said by John Gorton when he expressed the view that without destroying our Aboriginal culture we want to help our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become an integral part of the rest of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that we want the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves to have a voice in the pace at which this process occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McMahon  said ‘We believe that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must be helped to take an increasing part in the management of their own affairs.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right up to the change of government the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were involved only as passive recipients and at most were invited to endorse programs approved for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the problems confronting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - the vastness of the country, housing, health and education - we should ask ourselves whether we could have done the job any cheaper? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that if we are to maintain the level of assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the amount that has been appropriated this year will just about cover what we require to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Youth and Community Services in the New South Wales Government - I will not mention any names - went up there and decided that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had to be shifted because they were in a flood area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were settled in the 20 caravans with the promise that within 4 or 5 months or possibly a little longer houses would be built for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the introduction of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, which divides the Commonwealth into 41 electorates, we hope that many of the problems that now exist in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At last the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be able to submit their problems to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as a result of complaints coming from the various areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the many State and Federal organisations which have been set up for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we now have coming into being such organisations as Applied Ecology Pty Ltd, Aboriginal and Island Products Pty Ltd and Aboriginal and Island Marketing Pty Ltd which, of course, have ventured into the field of turtle and crocodile farming mainly for the purpose of benefiting the Aboriginal by keeping him employed, while at the same time providing a product for export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the public at large does not know the amount of work being done at the present time in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by organisations and institutions set up by the Commonwealth Government and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These organisations include the Sacred Sites for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Committee and the Committee on Linguistic Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To compensate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the loss of their exclusive use of reserve land and the disturbance of their way of life, a trust fund was established in the Northern Territory into which royalties from minerals mined on reserves were to be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact is that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not know the new Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we are achieving decent housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a source of worry to everyone who has lived among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and knows their history and what is happening to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of Aboriginal with whom I have had a close association is somewhat different, which bears out what my colleague says, namely, that there are various categories of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the clear indications that a uniform set of rules for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia would not be satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the great problems that everyone interested in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is trying to solve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of my experience of the activities of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their more lucrative and more prolific types of activity was gained in the area where I have spent, and am still spending, my lifetime - the north west of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I was to focus on one particular activity of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> I would look more specifically at Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had foreshadowed this; they knew the waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make is that the Government - no doubt it is doing this in the best way it can - should gain local knowledge and let the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> indulge in activities in which they are expert and then they will make a very profound contribution not only to their own advancement but to the advancement of the particular area in which they live.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be given the opportunity of developing these enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia differ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a group of opportunists who, let us face it, are not genuine <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and who will exploit genuine <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are part of the early and almost forgotten history of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay full tribute to a second group - I do not like to hear people talk about the city slicker type of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - who live in the cities, who have come out of their natural environment and who have obtained university degrees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that, although the total increase is large, the amount spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was growing year by year even under the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may not seem a great number of houses, and it certainly would not be if they were the only houses to be provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the South Australian Housing Trust certainly fills a great part of the gap in this field, because whenever the Housing Trust builds homes in an area where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live an allocation of houses is made to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the larger towns a considerable number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been allocated houses and have moved into the town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think legal aid is an area in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been at a grave disadvantage in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a white person was picked up he would engage a lawyer and possibly get off the charge, but of course this did not apply to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As everybody knows, in most cases, to save trouble the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> plead guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In quite a number of the remote places - Ernabella is one - there are ti few motor cars that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have probably purchased in Alice Springs, Adelaide or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are now mobile with motor cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested that the Highways Department of South Australia take a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, train them in the operation of earthmoving equipment and let them have the contract for looking after the road. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These councils have done a good job, particularly with the rural unemployment relief scheme, in providing work for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said tonight about housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I know that at Ernabella the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves have been building under the supervision of a tradesman carpenter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the statement of Professor Strehlow that  Dr Coombs  has no practical knowledge of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is becoming more and more obvious that the people who can help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are those who have practical experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need practical assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He speaks the language and he knows more about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than anyone in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 2 men say these things and so does anyone else who knows anything about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is sincere all along the line in trying to do something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are calling on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from all over Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon the Parliament involved itself in another very interesting debate on the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter on which I wish to speak is this: I do not think that honourable members on either side of the House realise the tragic plight of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> generally in the Northern Territory as a result of the manner in which they are indulging in the use of alcoholic beverages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very happy to see honourable members interest themselves more in this growing problem among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the answer, but I would like to see the liquor interests prevailed upon to agree to persuade <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have had a fair quantity of alcohol to go home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that honourable members will interest themselves in this problem of over-indulgence in alcohol by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us would suggest barring them from drinking, but we should prevail upon the liquor interests to desist from serving drunken <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or otherwise incur a very severe penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, did the Professor say, on resignation, that the  Chairman  of the Council of Aboriginal Affairs,  Dr H.  C. Coombs, has no personal experience of Aboriginal problems yet has direct access to the Prime Minister on major issues concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not had any figures from the outback - or at least I have not - but there are disturbing stories of hundreds of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having enrolled but only a few voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aspect has been raised by some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not from the outback but from the coastal areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, during the elections certain militant <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their genuine concern to stop the farce - that is what they call it - forced blacks away from the polls so they could not vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> everywhere have complained that the time allowed between voter registrations, the nomination of candidates and the actual voting day did not allow sufficient time to permit the people to become acquainted with the true function of the body to be elected or with the processes of nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was expressed in writing by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the experience that I have gained over the past 35 years as a result of living in association with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and from speaking to men who have had the same - if not more - experience, I believe that a grass roots approach should be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means going back to a hard slog of getting departmental officers or interested people - I would say both black and white Australians - to go out and consult with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fairly strong feeling is coming through at the grass roots level that although this Consultative Committee was set up and it was hoped that it would be a success, the way to discuss their affairs or any matters with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is to go and confer with them in the small groups in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, one might think that all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Hermannsburg, south-west of Alice Springs, were of the one group and one representative would speak for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to be critical; I am suggesting that we will probably have to go back to the concept of having teams trained to contact and talk to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must face the situation that these people differ from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are located on the fringe of towns or who work in cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would strongly press the Government to aim at training people to go out and work among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to sit down with them and find out what they themselves want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is to obtain the view of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> one has to give them time, time and more time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been saying this for years, as have a lot of other people who live in a fairly close relationship to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have previously listed in this House some 15 to 20 Europeans and 15 to 20 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - that is only in the Northern Territory - who should constitute an advisory panel to initiate advice to the Government and to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said often that I consider that the Minister and the Government are getting the wrong advice about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to get the right answer to the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> arid if we are to take the right action to assist them - this will take a long time - what I propose is the way that we will have to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He works with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and is, incidentally, the Superintendent of the settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, he works with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and they with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people who have been working with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> right down the line for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves do not want to turn their backs on such men and the experience these men have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister mentioned that another $10m will be allocated to provide 500 houses for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of housing brings to my mind another point about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only last year or perhaps it may have been the year before,  Mr Bernie  Kilgariff, the member for Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory Legislative Council, Jock Nelson and I - I do not remember whether he was the Mayor of Alice Springs - went around in an endeavour to stop the Housing Commission evicting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in so doing, once again we came up with the idea that the Department or the Government, should ‘be supplying great numbers of people to teach <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> how to live in houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who could do this job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are several other points I should like to raise, but in particular I wish to refer to the drinking problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of money is being spent on material requirements for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of other drinking problems as they affect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a lot older. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been drinking in excess and a lot of them have been on the grog for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the proper use of alcohol should be foremost in the Government’s thinking today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to spend $2m on buying properties for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which they probably will never work because they are all in the local pub! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do know something of the Queensland Department which deals with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that when these houses are built the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> become part of the neighbourhood and part of the community life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hopes that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves will be involved as much as possible, giving them self satisfaction while at all times maintaining their self respect and dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  mentioned that the Government was providing to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> an amount of  $  1,000 a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to statements that have been made by the eminent criminologist, Gordon Hawkins, which point to a dangerous and pernicious mythology in Australia today that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are paid in excess of what is paid to Europeans or white people, that is, through the Social Security Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not had the particular statement brought to my notice but it is one of the sad facts of Australian life that people do magnify the benefits that are being paid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> beyond all belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still some parts of Australia where for various reasons <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not receive the full benefits available to the rest of the community and there are some advantages, such as the secondary school allowances, which are payable to Aboriginal children and only to selected groups of non-Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps nobody would doubt the sincerity of those who were trying to find adequate enterprises and projects for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Tones Straits and elsewhere in Australia, but every effort must be made in the future to ensure that Aboriginal enterprises do not end up as failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this was followed then by statements by a senator in another place, making rather serious allegations against the way in which funds were being spent to advance <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means the children, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the criminals in gaols, the persons in mental institutions and members of the Armed Forces at home and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it appears to me that the Minister could be intending to do this with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government going to have discrimination with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> owning title to minerals, v/hen no one else owns such a title? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to statements by spokesmen for the Yirrkala <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> suggesting (a) that the hotel at Nhulunbuy be closed and (b) that the tribal groups return from the missionfounded settlement to their own ancestral grounds around Arnhem Land to protect the culture, family life and tribal unity of the tribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are involved in the employment carried on at the Mount Minnie property which was purchased by the Government for the Noualla Group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia for $33,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live on the property and in what type of accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each Service may reimburse existing facilities for the provision of Legal Aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the rate of the cost to that facility of assisting the Aboriginal in a particular matter, plus a amount equal to the estimated cost of administration by the facility of that matter not exceeding 5 per cent of the legal account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>acting as a liaising body to assist each Service with inter-State arrangements and to work to a national level of Legal Assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> be among those trained to care for the parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with its declared policy my Government will assume the constitutional responsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders given to the national government by referendum in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It intends to eliminate any remnants of discriminatory State legislation against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a hope declared but unfulfilled by an earlier Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government, on receipt of the report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission which is expected shortly, will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard I should mention that there is some spread-eagled constitutionality which could be brought together since the Commonwealth has the constitutional prerogative in regard to housing in the Territories and for such categories of people as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, students, public servants and a wider range of defence personnel than at present are covered by the Defence Service Homes Act and for certain recipients of social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government which came into office announcing such high flown attempts to raise the status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is now mutely, meekly abdicating its responsibility to those people, and not a single attempt has been made by the Prime Minister to set things right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the division of Kalgoorlie than in any division in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present law those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be taken into account only if they enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> alone among Australians do not have to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision will require <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be taken into account in determining the size of an electorate, even if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not choose to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that successive Country Party Ministers, particularly successive Country Party Ministers for the Interior, found his attitude on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unacceptable and unpalatable is to  Dr Coombs’  credit and to the discredit of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I represent more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this Parliament than 90 per cent of the people who sit in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to point out that after 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government the present Opposition parties must take some blame for the sad plight of many of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took too long for governments of the past to get started and when they did start they adopted a system of skimming the cream off the milk, of moving the best of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the towns and giving them an education and of trying to hide the rest of them away from public view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said before in this House, and I will say it again now, that no system of Aboriginal advancement will be any good unless we can find a way of uplifting the whole body of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the one time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present Government came to power <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> all over Australia complained bitterly that no one would take any notice of their views and that money was being wasted in all directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the flood period I visited many areas and was very surprised to hear the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> complaining that they were unfairly treated during the flood when they were moved in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, shamefully I think, many of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were better off during the flood than they were prior to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Coonamble I was shown about 11 homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and they were well kept and in good condition but one Aborigine said: ‘What about having a look at some of the other places?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three or four <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were living in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are getting their backs up about this kind of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reminded me that they are human beings and not animals and that they deserve something better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although one or two houses have been built nothing has been done to assist the advancement of the main body of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to representatives of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that a group of local people could solve the problem in no time if a prefabricated building of a double garage type, with some alterations, could be put on the land that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> occupy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves are in favour of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not want the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to move back into the other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seem to indicate to me that the elected parliamentarians, in the discharge of their duties, should have regard to the people of Australia as a whole and at all times endeavour to secure the advancement of the national welfare, including that of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that when it comes to the problem of our Aboriginal population too many people are too anxious to put <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in gaol and not anxious enough to give them a decent home and permanent employment so that they can share the good things of life with the rest of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem will continue to grow as long as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are unable to feel that they are part of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In matters such as defence, primary production, interest rates, postal services, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, pensions and the referenda or referendums - however one likes to say it - that have been put before this House one can see a degree of confusion and haste in most of the Government’s legislation and in most of its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some experience with this matter because there are a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the electorate of Lyne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  - this is one statement with which we can agree - said that the Government’s policy in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has neglected the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the poor, the pensioners and the weak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It came into office promising a new deal for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  has said that the implementation of Labor policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One expects the Government to have a crack at the Americans, the Brits and so on, but who would have thought that it would have alienated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and who would have thought that it would have alienated those refugees who sought refuge after the last World War in Australia where they could find a home safe from the knock on the door in the night, the secret police and the footsteps in the corridor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would have thought that we would have had to wait until 1974 and a Labor Government for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be given twice as much money as ever and to be half as happy with their lot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to these matters, we believe the proposed inquiry should be directed to examine the existing barriers to female employment, the role of the Government in the employment of physically and mentally handicapped persons, the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and the relationship between public employment and decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never thought that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should in any way have less than anybody else in the community, but what I have advocated and will continue to advocate is that unemployment benefits should he kept out of the areas where Aboriginals live by the simple expedient of making jobs available at the point where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say, by way of an aside, that that seems to me to be much the Prime Minister’s attitude to problems concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I questioned him about what would happen if there was a conflict of interests between the mining industry and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and his view was that perhaps the mining companies could put off going ahead with the mining for a few years, but then he went on to say that eventually the would have to go ahead with the mining irrespective of the interests of the Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he came to Gippsland we had a meeting at Orbost at which the main complaint lodged by the twenty or thirty <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> present at the shire chambers was the lack of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of a long tirade lasting about forty to fifty minutes  Senator Brown  directed his remarks mostly to the alleged failure of the previous Government to do anything for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia have benefited from the actions of a recent Minister- not the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs- who went around Australia distributing Government largesse in millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would have wanted to advance the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but, at the same time, he let those who followed him say with some conviction: ‘Take away this Government, change the Government, and the largesse which you are receiving will not be available to you any longer’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such fields as health, social security and help for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and in other areas such as education, the Labor Government has tried in a way that the Liberals did not to introduce genuine social reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the problem of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, those unhappy people, neither tribalised nor truly urbanised who live in the twilight zone of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise the question of their welfare tonight because the takeover of the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Victoria by the Australian Government is now so imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the referendum on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1967 when the Australian people gave the Australian Government the right to legislate for Aboriginal advancement there has certainly been a big increase in the Government’s activities in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the legislation relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is better in some States than it is in others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passage in 1967 of the referendum on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> permitted the Federal Government to accept a national responsibility and to adopt a national approach to the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government intends to proceed with its proposals in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland regardless of what the Queensland Government intends to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me indicate the concern that has been expressed by this Government for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of these funds will permit more assistance to be given to the States to provide housing, health, education, employment, welfare and community services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the work is being done by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest percentage of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in South Australia are in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal population ranges from those who still have strong tribal ties in the north-west reserve area to some sophisticated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in some of the larger cities in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that area, with the aid of money from this Government, purchased an old house in Port Augusta in which they sought to set up their own social club. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened since then is certainly to the credit of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me outline the types of activities in which these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> indulge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are striving to provide the Aboriginal children attending primary school with a hot midday meal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this, we find that relations between the police and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Port Augusta have never been on so high a level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work is under the control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have the assistance of a former employee of the earth moving firm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole undertaking is run completely by full blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Needless to say, a very considerable percentage of the funds that were appropriated last year and no doubt of those that will be appropriate this year in fact will not reach the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  announced in a Press release dated 6 June 1974 that there had been established the Australian Legal Office whose stated purpose is:  to provide legal advice and assistance to the socially deprived and people for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibility such as those on social services, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, ex-servicemen and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is supposed to be secretary of the CAAC which at Government expense during this election campaign circulated letters on the notepaper of the Congress recommending to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they did not support a certain candidate and suggesting that he was an ex-policeman who was known to treat <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> badly and belonged to a racist party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another letter suggested that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not support a certain candidate because he belonged to the racist CountryLiberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked him who he wanted to see and he said ‘Neville Perkins’, so the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> accept him as being associated with the legal aid service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could ask other questions about the way money is expended through government instrumentalities A lot of money is being spent through the legal aid service and other bodies but half the time the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not getting any benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am all for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having a fair go but money is being wasted by part-coloureds from elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not satisfied with that result, let us look to the Australian Capital Territory, where there is a different group of people altogether, the academic group, a group of people who can think for themselves and who began to see clearly and distinctly that they, like the pensioners and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, were being taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a system of land use control to avoid conflicts of interest between major processors and local land users, including <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plenty of information is available about such schemes as the training scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, assistance to country apprentices and the CESAME scheme- the Commonwealth Employment Service Automated Memory Employment training scheme for people displaced by redundancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to replace the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968, under which the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises was established, by an Act providing means of making loans to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> both for enterprises as in the past, and for housing and for personal purposes as denned in section 24. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed initially to appoint two or three leading financiers and businessmen, as well as at least 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to the Board of Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount provided for special groups such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants, soldiers’ children and isolated children, will be cut by $5.46m and if the amount payable to colleges of” advanced education and teachers’ colleges were included in the 8 per cent, expenditure in these areas would be cut by $25.6m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these are very considerable areas of land I ask the Government: Is it intending to ride roughshod over the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these areas and has any consideration been given to this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the significant companies has been bought on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional factor is that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, has bought 70 per cent of the largest operator in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the Government has purchased a 70 per cent share in one of the largest barge operators in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This share was purchased by the Government with a view to interesting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own affairs and to involve them in a transport operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my knowledge of the men who used to skipper the luggers across the north coast, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be hard put to do the work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present operators are prepared to help develop that business on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increased expenditures on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia give support to the disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done its best with the city of Newcastle to remove the discrimination which exists against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to recommending that Aboriginal reserves and certain other lands in the Northern Territory should be vested in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and that machinery should be set up to enable Aboriginal claims to other lands to be considered, the report recommended that a fund or funds should be set up from which additional lands could be purchased for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Woodward suggested that such funds should be seen as providing compensation in the form of useful land to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have lost their lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No wonder the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protesting against the Minister and his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, the New South Wales Housing Commission and the Housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> source of funds has given the only real help to the town of Moree in its efforts to overcome the great backlog of housing needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are people who do not treat the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> well but by and large there is a great degree of cooperation today among people out in those areas to try to ensure that the Aboriginal people get a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that out of spite and childish pique the Minister is going to deny housing to the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves have had a taste of the Minister’s standover tactics and his threat to cut off funds to the legal aid service unless it does as it is told, unless it is prepared to act as he wants it to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the ‘Canberra Times’ of 8 November, under the headline ‘End intimidation, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> told’ the following report appeared: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Senator Cavanagh,  said yesterday that he would not talk to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the present conflict between the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service and his department until ‘all intimidatory action indulged in at Canberra ends’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A department spokesman confirmed that  Senator Cavanagh  wanted two tents put up by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> opposite Parliament House removed and a planned demonstration today by 3 busloads of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> called off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh, who was reported to be upset at the action of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, telephoned his statement to the department in Canberra while on a 10-day tour of Aboriginal settlements in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not attempt to blackmail the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> opposite Parliament House when the Government of which I was a Minister felt that those tents had to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirming this last night, a spokesman for  Senator Cavanagh  said <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would also have to end all forms of protest in Canberra before talks could begin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it fair to the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to deny $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The protesting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> certainly do not rate either the Minister or his Department highly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that, due to the Department’s inability for one reason or another to fund it, the project has now almost stopped, thus dashing the hopes of the enthusiastic <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who started the whole thing off in the time of the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, no doubt with the best intentions and the best will in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my experience in Aboriginal welfare I am bound to say that there is such a diversity in the level of advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and in the levels of their living conditions that there is no simple common answer to the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said employment opportunity is very important in today’s economic climate opportunities are not there, although I hope that some of the Regional Employment Development schemes may provide opportunities for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a facility for loans that is not available to them elsewhere and at reasonable interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I should like to make is that, of course, the houses that have been built by the New South Wales Housing Commission under the Housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> scheme are funded through the States grants legislation that we have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we came into Government we found that our predecessors had assisted organisations on the basis of a yearly grant and that very often <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, with the best intentions in the world, did not have the administrative capacity to spend that money as well as they might. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provided an arrangement whereby Aboriginal business enterprises could be assisted on fairly generous terms in order that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could start businesses, buy businesses and develop a better income and a better life for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the experience of the last few years we have now come to realise that there are many other areas in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> need assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the program of assistance through the States for Aboriginal housing was evolved, no one imaged that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would actually own land themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a scheme much like the Commonwealth-State housing scheme in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would have made available to them rental homes on a very generous economic rental basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those of us who have been interested in this field have found that there have been <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have acquired their own piece of land or who may have been given a piece of land on which to build a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> very often live in isolated places where it may not be easy to sell the house to some other person, it is not always easy for them to get the finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill makes provision to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this whole area of housing- in the provision of furniture and a whole range of other activities, such as paying for funerals and the other calls that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it would be worth while to spell out again the policy of the Government, which is to provide such assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this generation that the lot of the Aboriginal people of this country might.be so improved that in future generations they might have real equality with all other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the Opposition is supporting this legislation indicates that the Opposition realises too that it is necessary in this time, in this generation, to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> generously in some cases in order that they and their children might enjoy real equality with other Australians in the next generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has never been the intention of this Government to set up a Department of Aboriginal Affairs like the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs which has been referred to at some length already and which has, in its day, managed the affairs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the cradle to the grave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an indictment of the administration of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs that a secondary education for an Aborigine is a one way ticket to the world outside, and that while the junior pass was formerly the level of entry to the Queensland Public Service, to the Queensland Police Force and, in earlier days, to the Queensland teaching profession, hardly any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have gone into the Queensland Public Service, only a handful have gone into the teaching profession, and I do not know of any who have gone into the Police Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government of New South Wales passed legislation whereby <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on reserves could apply to have those reserves transferred to a lands trust, and that legislation has been on the statute book of New South Wales for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in the process of transferring the reserves in the Northern Territory to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who occupy those reserves, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have traditional claims to those lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a great pity that it has used <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to chastise the Queensland Government on a matter that can only be an opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Bill, the Aboriginal Loans Commission Bill, is aimed at dealing in the main with those problems which are peculiar to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that surely we should adopt a common approach where there are common problems affecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the European community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim of the total offensive as far as Aboriginal affairs are concerned is to try to facilitate the ability of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be a selfdetermining, self-sufficient and self-sustaining people along with other people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people talk about the need for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be self-determining one must realise that one cannot just wave a magic wand and expect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to rise out of the horror of their own situation and to know exactly what they want and how they want to achieve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1972, the former Minister for the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts,  Mr Howson,  said in a second reading speech that the procedures that were to be adopted in a Bill he was putting forward were ironed out in consultation and after discussion with the State Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also told that so far there are no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Commonwealth Territories living outside Reserves, some of whom belong to recognisable communities or groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to recommending that Aboriginal reserves and certain other lands in the Northern Territory should be vested in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and that machinery should be ‘set up to enable Aboriginal claims to other lands to be considered, the report recommended that a fund or funds should be set up from which additional lands could be purchased for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We always sensed that there would be some difficulty in trying to apply this land rights principle to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living off reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To overcome that problem it was resolved that we should set up a land fund to buy land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> off reserves both in the Northern Territory and in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly enough, all the properties that the Minister mentioned and indeed most of the properties that have, in fact, been acquired for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia were the subject of negotiation, if not acquisition, at the time the Labor Government achieved office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a general trend towards trying to overcome this great land problem for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by most political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the whole administrative procedure is appalling; it reflects discredit on the Minister, the Department and the Government; and it gives some credence to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who seek a royal commission into the Charles Perkins allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest that there is anything wrong below the surface, but it leaves the doors open for incriminations and allegations, and I do not think that it protects the public coffers as well as it should and I do not think that it protects the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain procedures have been designed to prevent the Government from paying prices that are too high for properties for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> outside reserves, and this House is entitled to know whether the amounts of public money expended to buy Willowra, Kildurk Station in the Northern Territory, Everard Park in South Australia and Panther Downs in Western Australia accord with the values of the properties as assessed by the Valuer-General or the Government’s valuers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assure the honourable gentleman that there is no discrimination at all against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do make a special effort to have a fairly large percentage of the Department’s total Aboriginal work force stationed in areas of the States where a fairly high or even a moderate number of Aborigional people are living so that they can have the opportunity of servicing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment which we propose to move and to which I am optimistic that the Government will agree, will ensure that no land in a State can be acquired by the Commonwealth for a park or wildlife reserve which is dedicated or reserved under a law of a State for purposes related to nature conservation or the protection of areas of historical, archaelogical or geological importance or areas having special significance for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this sub-clause is agreed to it will provide the assurance necessary to gain the sort of trust and co-operation for which the Minister will be looking in trying to achieve the preservation of wildlife and the conservation of our fauna and flora generally and of areas that are of special significance or importance to people in the States, particularly to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason we have turned the clauses around a bit to make it clear that if we are going to deal with Aboriginal land we will first of all ensure that the complete understanding, co-operation and agreement of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is obtained beforehand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is often difficult to know to which group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> one should address one’s attention, so we have specified what is required in these terms in proposed clause 18: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not recognise that it is the prerogative of land councils to make these sorts of decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have very strong views about who owns land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this situation, we wanted if possible to find the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whom other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would concede have the traditional rights to that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, as some of the Aboriginal land is vested in Australia we cannot ride roughshod over the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and we cannot ride roughshod over whoever is their representative as far as the Australian Government is concerned: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister sighted a copy of the report on racial discrimination prepared by social work students at Sydney University and submitted to the Attorney-General which alleges that 1 7 out of 25 estate agents surveyed between March and May 1 974 would not rent homes to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-117">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Racial Discrimination Bill now before the Senate provides that such discrimination will be expressly declared unlawful by virtue of clause 12 and civil proceedings may be brought against estate agents refusing to rent homes because of the applicants being <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-117">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 1 May 1970  Senator Keeffe  received a letter from the then Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Wentworth,  in relation to the Queensland legislation observing that, as a result ofthe 1967 referendum, the Commonwealth had concurrent legislative power with the States regarding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Minister stated that the Commonwealth and the States had been discussing discriminatory and special legislation for some years, and that in the previous decade major changes had been made in all State Acts relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a subsequent answer to a parliamentary question,  Mr Wentworth  identified the Queensland legislation with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders as being prima facie discriminatory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is legal discrimination still in some Australian States against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but my Government has told those States that those laws will be repealed by those States within two years, or if they are not, we will move in and repeal them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the contention of the Queensland Government that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Queensland do not desire any further amendments to the Queensland law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders in Queensland are not to be employed on terms and conditions of employment that are less favourable than those applicable to other employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland laws with respect to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders contain provisions relating to the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in accordance with the provisions of awards, but these provisions only apply outside a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision applies only to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and does not apply generally to persons in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill are not intended to replace the whole of the Queensland legislation with respect to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, for example, that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders are unable to visit their relatives on reserves unless they apply for, and are granted, a permit to enter the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elsewhere in Australia, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a right to enter Aboriginal reserves but in Queensland not only do they have no title to those reserves but they must obtain a permit before being allowed on to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this provision is to supersede such provisions as regulation 14 of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Regulations, in its application to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which provides that a person authorised to be on a reserve shall conduct himself properly and to the satisfaction of the Aboriginal Council and manager or district officer of a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-80">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, preliminary analyses indicate the following: 82 per cent of persons approved for training were not employed at the time of making their application; 19 per cent of persons approved for training were redundant from their previous employment; about 50 per cent of persons approved for training were women (including widows) returning to the workforce; about 9 per cent of persons in training at 1 December 1974 were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-80">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee inquiring into poverty equated the situation of rural people and farmers with the standard of living of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to comment on the standard of living of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> except to say that I find it most difficult to accept that a government would spend in excess of $ 1 1 7m per year on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and adopt an attitude to Australian beef producers of saying: ‘Let them stew’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These may include, if the Government so decides- any future government- persons living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, migrants, students, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and persons engaged in work for the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions have also been held with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to ensure that the route of the road is satisfactory to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that there are no areas of special significance to them within 5 miles of the existing road. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could include, according to the Bill, ex-servicemen, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, Commonwealth public servants, contractors working for the Federal Government and persons in receipt of a Commonwealth pension; that is, aged persons, widows, deserted wives, supporting mothers, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, it can directly house migrants, students, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, persons engaged in work for the Australian Government and residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Australian Government has always been active in providing financial assistance for housing to certain groups in the community, including the poor, the aged, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and suitably qualified past and present members of the armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be an administrative one which would gather under its umbrella all the housing areas which are at present administered by the Commonwealth Government, such as housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, certain immigration procedures and defence service homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is it the intention of the Government that the activities of the Australian Housing Corporation should conflict in any way with established policy on the provision of housing for particular groups, such as migrants, students or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, that is a specific case:  migrants, students, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could still pursue all its objectives in the field of providing finance under the Defence Service Homes Act, for homes for pensioners, for homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for public servants and others for whom the Government may legislate under its constitutional powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows that there is no inhibition at all in respect of the provision of houses for people in the Territories or for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants, servicemen, ex-servicemen, students and for certain recipients of social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the broadest construction of the term ‘racist’, down to the inter-personal relationships between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans in Australian society, it is difficult to deny that prejudice exists and that this prejudice, over the years, has been erected into a functional system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is made for payments from the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account to the Aboriginal Enterprises Fund- $0.5m- and to the Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund$5m to permit the continuation of the financial support provided to individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and Aboriginal groups and enterprises, which commenced in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the recent example in Western Australia of the Premier,  Sir Charles  Court, resisting the Australian Government’s Royal Commission into allegations of police brutality when dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to our north, Queensland Premier Bjelke-Petersen has resisted Australian Government initiative to give land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were given land where they could lead their own lives in peace, the source of cheap labour would soon dry up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A classic example occurred only recently in my own electorate involving a free legal service for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Fitzroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that many honourable members here would be staggered to know how often such discrimination occurs, particularly as it affects <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members would have heard that hoary old tale about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are branded with inherent racial characteristics and inherent patterns of social behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all agree now that the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many were (a) persons threatened with redundancy, (b) women returning to the workforce, (c) <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, (d) students who had already begun a course and (e) blue collar workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today a lunch which was hosted by the honourable member for Brisbane  (Mr Cross)-  so apparently this is not a party matter at all- was attended by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Oenpelli. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this to those gentlemen who talk about a democratic society: Ask the oppressed peoples who sometimes have to survive in a democratic society; ask the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> about a democratic society; ask those who are getting angry at being denied their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of opposition from the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we witnessed the spectacle of the Government trying to force its will upon the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an Aboriginal society the environs of an Aboriginal community are an Aboriginal’s castle because clearly <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> enjoy living in communities and acting as communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as we claim and exercise the right as to who shall visit our homes, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the right to determine who shall visit their reserves, indeed their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that clearly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves see thencouncils as their corporate voice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been the view of Commonwealth governments for a substantial period of time that discriminatory laws that affect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act of 1971, the Torres Strait Islanders Act of 1971 and to the regulations made under those Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that given the fact that we probably face a generation of legislation which positively discriminates in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders, in the long term the needs of the Aboriginal and Island people of this country will be met by those Commonwealth and State government Acts and departments that service the needs and requirements of all of the other people in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to look at the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act of 1 97 1 or the Torres Strait Islanders Act of 1971 and the regulations made under them one would think that they provide an eminently sensible system of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government, when my friend the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  was the Minister in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, supported Aboriginal legal services which were designed to ensure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were protected when they were charged in any court in the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still regulations under the Queensland Acts which require <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or islanders to perform work under the direction of the administration of the reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders who live on a reserve should enjoy the same award wages, the same conditions of labour, the same terms and conditions of employment as any other Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be logical to look to those who have some influence and standing in the affairs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders to declare their attitude in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders are Queenslanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This distracts our attention from those admirable people among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders who stand tall and proud within our society, achieving their status by merit and ability and not only refusing to ask for charitable treatment or treatment that smacks of a degree of condescension but also arguing that it should not be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an argument to advance here that the more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are given too soon the less tendency they have to assume their civic responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we swing back to features of the Racial Discrimination Bill which would necessitate that if one of these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from a reserve or, to a lesser extent, one of these Torres Strait Islanders who ethnically seem to demonstrate an all-round greater ability in their original state should apply for a position in this outside world and find that because of lack of opportunity he is not up to the job and preference is given to a non-Aboriginal, immediately, under the terms of the Racial Discrimination Bill, an employer who decides to exercise that preference is liable because of all the reasons advanced for discrimination against the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a Queenslander who is conscious of his responsibilities in this matter and is proud to number among his friends many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and some Torres Strait Islanders, I convince myself in all sincerity that their best interests are not being well served by the introduction of the measures that the Government now contemplates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He brought with him the concept- I ask honourable members to bear in mind that this was 15 years ago- that the South Australian Government was ruining the initiative and the individuality of the Aboriginal race by making it too easy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to claim, for example, free tucker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great advances were made in the field of child mortality and in bringing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to missions, as they were in those days, and also to government reserves to try to give them some pride in their own endeavours and their own success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a forerunner to taking over a large and good station property in the north of the State, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in those days were trained, properly I think and within a limited scope, to play their part in the shearing teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rightly or wrongly- I concede that it could have been a good measure- minimum wage levels were set for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately the problem was to get <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could not be employed as stockmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> suddenly discovered that where formerly they could obtain employment they now could not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason was that, despite the best of will in the actions of governments which led to the setting of minimum wage levels, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, according to the people who had to employ them, had been priced out of the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great misfortune suffered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been magnified greatly by the level of inflation which has made discrimination a lot more real in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt that a majority of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> desire to join in the Australian society and wish to attempt to do a good day’s work so that they may become part of and not separate from the whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in many areas of Australia today the stage has been reached where many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being discriminated against because they cannot obtain employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already discussed one of the reasons why <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no earthly use being kind and pricing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to do all we can to develop the remarkable situation, for instance, which I found in Murray Bridge in my electorate a little while ago, where the Government allows free dental treatment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at repatriation rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A dentist in that area told me only five or six weeks ago that he has had 2 cases where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have said to him: ‘We do not want free treatment; we are part of the Australian society, we have a job and we will pay our own way, even if it is only to a dentist’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I doubt whether I would have had the pride to take the same steps as to the 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this case who said: ‘No, we do not want something free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will take more pride in their race and that they will be encouraged by governments to hold up their heads and do their job of work to the benefit of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the questions that arise across the board- the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to manage their own affairs, freedom of movement and the right to privacy- are being dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that some of the Minister’s words are a little hollow when on the one hand he says that he wants <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders to seek self-determination, to seek initiative, to seek the running of their own affairs and, on the other hand, on a combination of clauses 4 and 5, he seeks to do precisely the opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This Government very shortly will introduce legislation to give land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I completely repudiate the suggestion that this Government rejects the properly expressed views of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When looking at the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Gwydir the first point to be considered is that we are dealing with an Act of the Queensland Parliament which is in force, so anything that is done concerning the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enter on to reserves is done under the authority of that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been led to believe that in any case the local people control absolutely the entry of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders on to the reserves which are controlled under the Queensland law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a discriminatory law which applies only to Torres Strait Islanders and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in Queensland who enter or live upon those reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be clearly understood by honourable members that the clauses which were removed by the Senate and which are the subject of the amendment now before us are there to protect the rights of all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and all Islanders to enter upon and live peaceably on those places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Queensland, at Cape York and other places, there are some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are of substantial tribal background and who would make the same claims to tribal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most serious indictment that I make of the Queensland Department is that it has created insufficient opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who receives a secondary education to have a meaningful career on the Aboriginal reserves in Queensland and play a proper role in the management of those reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If assimilation is to be a fact of life and if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to have a free choice as to whether they assimilate into the broader Australian community or stay in their own communities, it must be a 2-way traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point again that I think that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these communities should have a substantial say in who comes in or goes out of their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of the Northern Territory, who were probably more concerned with the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than were people in any other community in Australia, were denied the right to vote at that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another general comment which I wish to make relates to the degree to which funds allocated for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders are being eaten up by administrative expenses and salaries of bureaucrats and middlemen, some of them in private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From what the previous  speaker  said I think that the Opposition still believes in a separatist policy for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because this appears to be what it is seeking in denying <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the expertise of consultants and bureaucrats of the white community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the major items of expenditure are: Salaries and payments in the nature of salaries; administrative expenses; other services, and this is where the greatest increase is; Aboriginal advancement or payment to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust; conferences, meetings and consultations- they were not consulted before; investigations and research; support of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on government settlements; assistance to missions- of course, the previous Government would know all about those areas of expenditure; repairs and maintenance of settlements; vocational training and adjustments; support for ecological projects; support for Aboriginal sporting activities; support for Aboriginal publication activities; the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; the housing panel contribution; Aboriginal enterprises for payment to the capital fund for Aboriginal enterprises; National Aboriginal Consultative Committee- again there was no voice for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before; salaries and allowances of members; meeting expenses; the provision of facilities for members; election expenses; incidental and other expenditure in that area; Aboriginal Loans Commission; Aboriginal enterprises for payment to the Aboriginal enterprises fund; and so I could go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The general attitude of the Opposition would take us back to the days when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were treated as they were during the war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps honourable members opposite would like to see a return of the situation where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were locked up at Moore River Missionthe children put in Wandering Mission- the children forcibly taken from their parents under the provisions of an Act and educated somewhere other than with white children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that there is an allocation for Aboriginal housing and I draw to the Minister’s attention the fact that in Western Australia- I know that the Opposition would not agree with this because a consultant has been asked to look into it- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want to establish a building company of their own in order to be in a position to utilise tradesmen who are being trained at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that some 10 bricklayers are being trained as the base for this company which Will seek to build homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the Perth metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the Government, if it consults with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, will receive the co-operation which has been very evident in the past in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it is useless to have a situation where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> put their questions to the people concerned and who they elect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose for which I rose to speak on these Estimates was to ask for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be allowed autonomy instead of our having the high handed attitude, which has been so evident in the past, of everything being on a cost basis, on an efficiency basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that the white community is responsible for the situation in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> find themselves through lack of education as a result of a lack of attention to the demands of the 1967 referendum held under the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I know how closely and how well members of all sides of the Parliament have worked under the honourable member for Brisbane  (Mr Cross),  our  chairman,  to try to do something positive for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and not just make Party political points concerning the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might be understood for fearing that the more articulate or better educated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might exercise a stronger influence on the Council than his or her tribal brother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, Members of our Committee went along to one of the Council’s meetings and we found that so many of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were confused as to what they should be doing and how they should be running their meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a lot of notice could be taken by the Department to show the Aboriginals just how the Council could run more efficiently in the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has shown that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can play a very significant part in the running of this nation, not only as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but as Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that we hear a lot about drinking problems among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a problem we have to face with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and it is a problem that many white people face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is not confined solely to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it is not in the interest of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they should drink alcoholic liquor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems facing the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are very different from those facing the fringe dwelling <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect of the estimates shows the increasing amount which is being channelled through organisations which are composed of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and which are Aboriginal controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that aU of us reject the concept that we should be paternalistic in the programs that are financed by the Australian Government to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But leaving aside the more spectacular areas, the mistakes which I think all of us will admit have from time to time been made, there is a basis of very solid achievement within this program, real achievement in terms of approximately 12,000 children of Aboriginal descent now at secondary schools compared with the mere hundreds attending such schools before the program of Aboriginal secondary education grants was established; the substantial number of Aboriginal people who are now living in better housing than they were before; the numbers of Aboriginal children who are now receiving a better education in pre-schools, and schools whether those schools be conducted through the State system or whether the children go away and board; and, of course, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are assisted through Aboriginal enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are many people who, when looking at a program put forward in regard to Aboriginal affairs, are inclined to say: ‘This is discrimination in favour of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not want this discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not need this, they do not want it and it is harmful’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report tided ‘Rural Poverty in Northern New South Wales’ by the Poverty Commission of Inquiry noted that if the 1973-74 expenditure on Aboriginal welfare of $1 17.4m had been given directly to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, then estimated at 140 000, it would have meant $838 for every man, woman and child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliamentarians in this place have a primary right to protect 2 groups of people to be assisted- in this case the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, of course, the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never heard anyone deny that the relationship of power or authority between us and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the main has always been with the European population having authority over the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a small ethnic minority- I believe that it is projected that they will represent 2 per cent of our population by the end of the century- they will remain under this disability for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the problem from our position I suppose we would not be very concerned but if one were to look at our relationship from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> one would understand that this relationship must have an effect on the Aboriginal population, especially on a young Aborigine going to school with his companions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the problem, as we become more affluent, will be that we will have to make a greater redistribution to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this I think it should be remembered that the circumstances in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now live were not caused by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; I believe that they are the end result of our own settlement, our own investments and the effect that our communications and transport had on Aboriginal society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these things have forced <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into a position of involuntary dependence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason alone I believe that this appropriation is justified and that we have an obligation, a responsibility, to lessen the hurt to and to lighten the burden of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this fact, I believe that we have reason to expect a degree of co-operation from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how we look at these matters; we cannot expect any great credibility in world forums, especially those where the developing nations are involved, if we allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to live in the conditions in which they live at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indictment of the European population that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should feel it necessary to remind us that they are human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to the situation that I found at the end of the 1973 floods when the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Wilcannia were flooded out as a result, I suppose, to some extent of the weirs and water schemes constructed lower down the river which caused a bank-up of water which flooded the grounds on which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had camped for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were living in tents the situation was much better than it was before the floods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately a promise was made to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that permanent houses would be built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time we returned to them, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were very disappointed and a good deal of resentment was generated against the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Wilcannia, we have joined in many discussions with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their committees, including their housing committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was surprised that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not only allowed us to express our opinion on what the remedy should be but also went to a lot of trouble to point out where we went wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of my convincing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they should accept something else, they convinced me that what they wanted to do was quite right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What worries me and what should worry the Government- but that is not the point; it should worry the Australian people- is that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the north of Australia, whether they be in Western Australia or in the Northern Territory, are being debauched by a flood of money which they cannot sustain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not my letter from which I have quoted; this is a letter written officially by the council of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Oenpelli. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is a running sore and it is very bad news for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at what is and has been for many years a fantastic settlement . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- a fantastic place for them to live in and work in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are needed who will work with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who will help them, who are sympathetic towards them and who have experience and knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, many of the people who are coming into these areas today have neither the experience nor the knowledge, and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are suffering as a result of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that someone must act as a consultant in the running of such an enterprise until the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> reach the stage where they can run it themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Wave Hill have been given 1250 square miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that ever since this Government came to office I have had a standing offer to the Government- I endeavoured to get the same message across when we were in government- to get hold of someone who knows how to run a cattle station, who knows something about cattle and who knows something about working with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and to get him to run these places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A vast amount of money has been made available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister wm probably remember when the land at Wave Hill was being given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to hear people here saying what was not done during the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, because in actual fact a lot was done for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during that time before the present Government came into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of money has been spent and great strides have been made towards the betterment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to us, if we are going to do any good for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at aU, to take it away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is deplorable and I hope that this Government will take every action that it possibly can to see that both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans are brought together, understand each other and work together on projects for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, because they will be a failure if the European is not there to assist the Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of so much money being spent on material things we should be spending it on training people, on giving them the experience, on trying to find men and women with experience who can give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the lead and help them enter the future life that they are going to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say once again that it is no use voting tremendous amounts of money unless there is sympathy, understanding and preparedness for the people of Australia to be with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and work with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the term Aboriginality has gained credence- a term which is intended to identify all people of Aboriginal blood with the commonly held view that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been dispossessed of their land and have been broken by white settlement- the term in itself tends to oversimplify the totality of the problems and the actions we must take in order to try to tackle the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales, while most of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and people of Aboriginal bloods identify themselves with the term Aboriginality they have become part of the wider Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Minister on behalf of the Moree Aboriginal Advancement Association whether it would be possible to get a special works project going within that store in order to provide employment for the many unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the town and district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on it seem to think that it has failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difficulty for the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is that on the NACC they can barely cope with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed on the part of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to establish an association which also is to be incorporated and which probably will become the instrument by which the secretariat and the other funding requirements will be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also the Government’s intention to proceed with a royal commission into the plight of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory in the hope that we will be able to effect better relations in the future between the Aboriginal people and the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In terms of the total staff which at 1 October stood at 1490, more than half-744- are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excluding these, there remain 124 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the Department’s total number of 840 second, third and fourth division staff members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these people exercising this control I hope would be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, as the time went on, more would be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fairly restrictive in regard to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who can take part in the enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge this minor change of attitude upon the Government and in fact upon all people who deal with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and with any weak minority groups within the community, because success is so important to those groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes payments to private legal practitioners of $7m, grants to the States to supplement existing legal aid schemes of $lm and legal aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of $3m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Within days of being elected we were able to put into effect policies that ended conscription, removed the last vestiges of involvement in Vietnam, cut many of the ties with South Africa and commenced to improve the lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said: ‘There is a large population of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill would assist not only the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who are the main offenders, but everyone concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The education of migrants and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is another area that claims priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves want it stopped and asked for something to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are asking for is proper police protection, and they are entitled to have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are asking for the protection of police and specifically asking for the location of European police officers in their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To what tribes do the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> belong other than the Gurindji tribe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-48-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the flexibility within the Act is extremely interesting and will lead to a lot more families- particularly families of deserted wives and those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are not able to move into home ownership- being able to buy a home, which is the dream of most of us, through the Australian Housing Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in one New South Wales town, Moree, the waiting list for Housing Commission homes for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1974 alone grew by twelve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that in Sydney housing conditions for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are so desperate that South Sydney Community Aid literally has to beg real estate agents to accept Aboriginal tenants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has pledged to house properly all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by 1983. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> understand them and the public also must understand them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was to make funds available to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who wish to purchase their own homes, taking into account personal wishes as to design and location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what of the promise ‘to take into account <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ personal wishes as to design and location’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have they allowed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to participate in the housing programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And still the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have remained the victims, remained dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is saying that where housing is a live issue, whether among tribal Aboriginal communities or non-tribal associations, it is reasonable to assume that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves Will discuss the housing they prefer and determine their own priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has tended to tell <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> what their housing needs are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wherever practicable, self-management by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is our objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was quite unfair and indeed it is false to suggest that this Government does not stand for dialogue, consultation and co-operation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the field of Aboriginal housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he provide a list of all schemes under which grants for loans or any form of assistance is provided to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Aboriginal groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of loans provided by the Aboriginal Loans Commission is to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to engage in business enterprises that are likely to become, or continue to be, successful or in the case of housing and personal loans to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their spouses to obtain a house, housing land and various essential personal items, such as basic furniture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only one you got through was one which said that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be regarded as people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in this latter group would be, for instance, students, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it is, the federal legal aid program proposed in this BUI will be limited constitution.ally to all matters arising under federal law and to people to whom the Federal Parliament has a special responsibility, such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, students, migrants and pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1 975-76 Budget $ 16.7m was provided for legal aid, $ 13.7m of which was allocated to the ALAO and $3m for legal aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others thought to benefit would be pensioners, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, Labor voters and deserted wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The planned Labor and Immigration advertising program for 1975-76 includes $ 100,000 for staff advertising and $250,000 for promoting employment opportunities particularly for youth, handicapped persons and <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, and for apprenticeship and industrial training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal Legal Services on the other hand are an example of community control by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not happy to have their legal service integrated into the ALAO service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could have been done while maintaining grants to the States and to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for legal aid . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that they are not confined to Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they understand that this could be a means whereby <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in other parts of Australia could obtain title or rights to land in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this legislation is to recognise and set out in a somewhat simpler form than applies in the existing State laws the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have the sophistication and business experience to comply with many of the complex and technical requirements of State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation should prove a very useful step forward in assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to incorporate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are quite different from the land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a community like Cherbourg, near Brisbane, for example- and I do not denigrate in any way the right of the people of Cherbourg to own their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been there for 10 days and the Minister agreed to allow them to purchase the home for $32,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the National Country Party speaks in this place precisely for those groups in our society who see themselves as threatened by land rights becoming available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are witnessing this last ditch attempt on the part of the honourable member for Wentworth to have the whole affair referred to yet another committee because the Country Party lives in hope that the matter of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, like the matter of electoral reform and one vote one value, can be staved off in the hope of an electoral miracle which will somehow make these issues dead letters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why otherwise could it have been that 8 long years had to go by before a small group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, possessed of a fierce pride and an unusual measure of determination, could achieve title to their land at Wave Hill, title to land which was traditionally associated with the Gurindji tribe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is undoubtedly true that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> show a unanimity in their voting behaviour in some settlements and on some missions which cannot be accounted for by any of the conventional rules of political science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Lake Tyers, a valuable property hitherto previously used as an Aboriginal reserve, was handed over to a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, broken in health, broken in spirit and deprived of self-respect, who were unable to take advantage of what had been given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of the 212 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living at Wattie Creek, how many are participants in the Muramulla Gurindji Pastoral Company or are dependants of participants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are simply talking about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in a particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Registrar will determine the manner in which the election is to be conducted and he will explain to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the manner in which the election is to be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great things that we have to look at is the capacity on the part of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to exclude from their own area not merely Europeans but also Aboriginal people who are not conforming to their rules of the area or who are tribally incompatible with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Arnhem Land, of the north of Australia and of the centre of Australia require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are not going to give that kind of authority to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It worries me very much that this Bill, which I am sure has been drafted with the very best of intentions- I do not want to denigrate the intentions of the people who have drafted this Billwas not meant, as the Minister said- he has gone back on his word- to come into operation until the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had had an opportunity to study it and to tell us what they wanted in regard to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will want- it is not provided for in clause 30 as it should be- is power for local groups to issue and withdraw permits to enter their areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time already taken in investigation of these proposals and particularly in investigation of the proposal of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been  very great, and there can be no question that the inquiry into land rights carried out by  Mr Justice  Woodward was one of the most thorough and searching inquiries which has been seen in this country in recent years, yet the Opposition is anxious to see this legislation referred for yet another inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the pastoralists on whose properties the overwhelming number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have lived, the pastoralists who have so overwhelmingly ignored the proper provision of medical care on their properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From his one trip to Wave Hill, where I gather he got a fairly good dousing, and deserved it, he would have no idea of some of the very good works performed by pastoralists and citizens of the Northern Territory for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor supporters have been seen grabbing how to vote cards from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various areas and abusing people for supporting the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also claimed that the Australian Labor Party was the first party to introduce land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the Legislative Council, as it then was, conferred land rights on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under the Northern Territory Lands Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were given rights on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> virtually had control and ownership of one-sixth of the Northern Territory plus various cattle stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 properties which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> owned at that timeEverard Park which is now called Mimili, Willowra and Kildurk- are not run properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although everyone supports Aboriginal land rights, great consideration should be given to the delicate situation of people who are training <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a scheme to delay land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn the Minister that if he receives and mentions telegrams from the northern land council- from Bathurst Island, Melville Island and many other areas, but Bathurst Island in particular- in support of the Bill he should realise that there were 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, one part coloured, on the land council, and seven were what one might call ‘heavies’, department men or legal advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been pleas from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in central Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish to consider it- they do because they have indicated this from all quarters and Balanda Territorians wish to discuss it for the good of the people in the Northern Territory- the Government should discuss it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those men realise that both black and white must work together for the future of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the land trusts and the handling of the land situation can do nothing but bring very severe problems into the family life of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to mining, certainly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must have interests in joint ventures with Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill as it stands will destroy the permit system which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> again and again have requested the Liberal-Country Party, or the Country-Liberal Party as it is in the north, to preserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The permit system gives to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the right to say who shall go on to their land; and that is their right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to establish in a permanent way the rights of the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the land which they have been deprived of for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the white man came to Western Australia <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> enjoyed relative freedom from want, disease, ignorance, squalor, and idleness in terms of their needs then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hundred and fifty years later the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are but one-half of their earlier number, they have been transformed from semi-nomadic hunters to sedentary unskilled labourers, and from freely self-determining persons to degraded dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is clear that one of the prime objectives of the Government and most observers on the question of Aboriginal advancement has been to try to establish a way of life in which these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, both as individuals and communities, can be selfdetermining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some very grave pitfalls, as we move towards self-determination amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that matter has to be approached with very great care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not ever allow ourselves to wash our hands and say that because it is the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ wish, we should not intervene in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why the Bill does not refer to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be the custom now to call <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ‘Aboriginals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various definitions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been put before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that for a person to be identified as an Aborigine he had to be born an Aborigine and be prepared to live in the traditional style of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or words to that effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What worries the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory- I refer to those who we in the Northern Territory understand to be the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the full bloods- is that this definition and in many cases this Bill will allow people who they do not consider to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at all, although they may claim to be spokesmen for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and make publicity for and speak on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a meeting is held down here, perhaps these people who claim to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sway that meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am defending them against the interlopers, the part coloureds or whatever they are from the south, who express opinions all over Australia on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they are to be allowed by this definition in this Bill to go to the Northern Territory and tramp on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again I think he will have considerable trouble in this regard because some of the people he may believe in and who are making noises on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have the respect of either the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory do not accept them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about the carpet baggers who will be coming from the south and trying to exploit the full-blooded <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because by this Bill we are giving, very properly, tremendous material advantages to a group of full-blooded <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable members think that the carpet baggers who call themselves <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but who are really three-quarters or more of European origin, will not go to the Northern Territory to try to cash in? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of criticisms have been levelled by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- a lot of them have been levelled by de-tribalised Aboriginal people- about the Aboriginal land commissioner as a functionary appointed under Part II of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask Government supporters not to get me wrong and to say that I am trying to stop the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having something in the future or in the present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once people have to go from Darwin to Millingimbi to discuss a proposal about what is going to happen to the land of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and once you start saying that you have to give them some building or some architectural advice or you have to give them some other sort of advice or assistance, naturally you are going to start building within that large land council another bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, this is one of the rights which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in north Australia especially hold very sacred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want control over people, whoever they happen to be, whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or not, who do not have the right to go on to their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the fundamentals of Aboriginal life is that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish to control the set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the remarks made about me and my limited knowledge of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I think I know this and that the Government does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly true that we have had <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> coming before a commission and giving their points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  has proposed that the matter go to the Committee for consideration so that the interested people who include the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and our own council in Darwin can have an opportunity of putting their views before that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that  Mr Justice  Woodward made a point of consulting with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the whole course of his inquiry during 1973 and up to the submission of his report in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not want any vacillation or delay in respect of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They talk about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not being contaminated by white opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this situation, I am advised, all the white people, all the non-Aboriginal people, were asked to leave the meeting so that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could make up their own mind, and indeed they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tell him here and now that what he says does not represent the views of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I forestalled him this morning by telling him that the composition of the Northern Land Council that sent that telegram from Bathurst Island was 7 whites, one part-coloured and 2 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an absolute falsehood to say that all the people at the Native Land Council on Bathurst Island are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously he is not interested and does not understand <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, their traditions or the usage of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister should not trot into this House and tell me or any of us from the Northern Territory who understand these things far better than he does- I do not say we understand them entirely but we understand them far better than he or anyone on his side of the House doesthat this Bill represents the wish of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all means give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> land but the Minister is cutting across everything they are interested in, everything they understand and everything they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no answer simply to say that because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are used to sorting out things they can agree on boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not let us imagine that because <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> traditionally seem to resolve their problems problems will not arise in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think he is quibbling with the proposition that members of the land council should be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that they should be chosen by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in the area of the land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the time being, having regard to the initial role of these 2 councils, which is very much about seeking out the identity of the land and the owners- and a great deal of field work has been undertaken at considerable cost where the views of a wide range of people are extremely beneficial- there is a lot to be said for having <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> together in such numbers on but 2 councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might think of proceeding by making it clear that we are talking about traditionally oriented <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These land councils will be talking about land which is allotted to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because of their traditional association with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being so, one would want to make certain that the people who were on these councils were traditionally oriented themselves and were selected by traditionally oriented <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Land Council, in numbers will be dominated by Darwin <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, many of whom are no longer traditionally oriented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Darwin have repudiated or lost their links with their traditional lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a constant circulation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> between Arnhem Land and Darwin and some of those in Darwin maintain their full traditional links. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this clause we may easily find that the Northern Land Council will be dominated by non-traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to be definite about it until I have had a chance to talk to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned because, after all, what we should be doing is trying to bring forward a piece of legislation that suits the purposes not of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government, the Opposition or the Europeans, but the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to do that we need to consult the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and this is the one thing that we are not allowed to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not complaining about their being <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again what we are saying is that someone other than, for example, Daisy and Sam from Goulburn Island, who are genuine traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, could dominate that Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite seem to be concerned about the possibility of part-Aboriginal people- even full-blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are not following the traditional Aboriginal ways of their forefathers- getting control of these councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of rights to the local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We get all these complexities which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves will resolve if left to themselves but they are inimical to our idea of ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are saying what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will do with their land, what ceremonies they will perform on it, what they should do in an economic sense, whether they will have fishing, hunting, agriculture, or pastoral pursuits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be determined for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by a land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also felt the approach was a sensible one because the community is the basic political and social grouping for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in modern society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that he did make an attempt to find out what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happened not in relation to  Mr Justice  Woodward but in relation to an administrator of the Northern Territory who knew <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and was very sympathetic towards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to Yirrkala when the agreements with the aluminium company, Nabalco Pty Ltd, were being negotiated and he obtained from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> consent to what was going to be done to them at that place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Afterwards when the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> saw what they had given consent to- they did not realise and did not understand the implications- they were appalled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have something which I am sure that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- if their consent has been got formally- do not understand what they have consented to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) What are the details of developments in connection with properties which were purchased for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with public funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Properties purchased for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with public funds by both the previous and the present Governments were established pastoral properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the cost of the purchase of 10 960 square kilometres of pastoral properties in the Northern Territory for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What properties have been purchased for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in each State and what was the cost of purchase in each case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What properties in each State are now being negotiated for purchase for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and what is their size and estimated cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, residential blocks and business premises in the Northern Territory have been purchased on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from funds made available by this Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I was particularly impressed by the sensitivity of his remarks in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the problems of the inhabitants of the Torres Strait islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have come to the conclusion that our doctrine of assimilation is impertinence; our doctrine of integration is impertinence; every doctrine that we have imposed on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a piece of impertinence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have assumed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to be our subjects or our citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first educational decision made by myself and taken to the then Prime Minister was that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had a right where they so chose to an education in their own language as the medium of instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost every cutback in expenditure he has introduced has been aimed at the weakest and least protected groups in our communitythe pensioners, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the migrants, the people who are trying to re-establish themselves by means of retraining schemes, the unemployed, and now the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Liberal and Country Parties during their previous administration introduced many individual training schemes- for married women, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other specially disadvantaged people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report points out that there are many groups, such as single mothers and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who understand the needs of their members and can make a most valuable contribution towards meeting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>benefits for various disadvantaged groups, and to reduce expenditure on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by $7m this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also enhance the expression of public support in the referendum of 1967 when the Federal Government, under the leadership of the late Harold Holt, was entrusted with the paramount responsibility to legislate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These projects aim to increase the participation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the work force, to provide on-the-job training for unskilled workers, and, importantly, to provide employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in areas where jobs are scarce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Committee has also seen the need on occasions to go outside its terms of reference and to look at the socially deprived, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants to see whether their background and the difficulties they face in a new community or a strange society prevent them from coping with the learning process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Commonwealth Employment Service, which had a responsibility to find jobs and to create special works projects for the Aboriginal people did not employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in its office employed on a form of special works projects, training them to take up positions in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special emphasis was placed in the report on the need for the Public Service Board to give attention to that matter and for Australian Government instrumentalities actively to recruit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for employment and to create positions for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government does not take roads out to the reserves or to where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live- not universally anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am somewhat shattered by what has been happening through the years and I only hope that this new Committee, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  and honourable members on both sides see their way clear to keeping politics out of Aboriginal affairs because politics certainly do not do anything for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the money is being spent in a sincere endeavour to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but in a most misguided way the Government is spending $500,000 to buy a cattle station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not know what they are going to do with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of thing and the spending of that son of money are not doing the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the slightest good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to find people who are prepared to spend their time and their experience helping <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We hope that that will not happen on this occasion but that the Committee will find a real opinion about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; that it will speak to these people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear of telegrams coming from the northern land council and the central land council and people purporting to be spokesmen for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one speaks to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, underneath this very thin veneer of representation, some of which might be here tomorrow, one will find that they do not think that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you read Strehlow, Albrecht and Stolle and these people who have lived and spent their lives with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and speak their language, you will find that that is what they will say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we in the Northern Territory and we who have some knowledge and experience of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> say: Do not force that Bill through the House without referring it to the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mean especially the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is to talk about land rights or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, go and speak to the people who know something about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were standing bewildered in the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Committee will be able to see through that sort of thing and will be able to listen to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whether they be in the Northern Territory, where we say an Aborigine is a different person to one covered by the definition of ‘Aboriginal ‘-quite wrongly- in the Bill produced by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it should also listen to those other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should remember that those in the Northern Territory, where we have the greatest percentage of real <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, do not accept the domination of these people from the south, whether they claim to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who must be consulted by any committee dealing with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the people who live in the area, whether they are black or white or part coloured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said when I started my speech if I can help in a non-political way to help the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the people who live in those areas to live together, I feel that I will be doing some sort of a job for Australia and for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Committee will work towards giving the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a greater say and greater responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to serve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to any extent we have to reverse that policy and we have to be rid of the people who espouse it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  has more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Aboriginals- I am never too sure of the terminology- in his electorate than anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These days, when we take into account the full bloods and pan blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and so on the figure is something like that again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of the day has to recognise- I think this is the crux of the federalism policy which we will be introducing- that there are States and that those States have got massive responsibilities in the areas of health, education, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and a whole range of things, and that those States’ governments are charged with the responsibility of looking after those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we have had $360m worth which have meant the breaching of Budget promises to people such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable gentlemen would be aware, the Commonwealth is concerned that there should have been adequate consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Aurukun community concerning the proposal and the arrangements between the Queensland Government and the consortium in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Premier is at the moment considering a proposal that there ought to be discussions in Queensland involving himself, the Minister for Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How the tools of capital opposite can bear themselves in the knowledge that it is the pensioners, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the people in need of health care and pharmaceutical benefits, the migrants, those needing legal aid and others in depressed sectors who are affected by this program, is absolutely beyond me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are far better ways of spending money and helping <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than buying a cattle station which even if it costs $500,000 1 could run with 10 men-and that does not feed very many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government: Get a look at all that and see that we are getting value for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the money spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being brainwashed, as they were in the streets of Alice Springs the week before last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are saying that certainly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have land rights, but that the land should be allocated in a fair way and in accordance with what the real <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> believe and want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man presided over the greatest handouts to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that this country has seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While they were there, Throsby and Wild, with a constable named Vaughan, pushed on south in search of the Murrumbidgee, of which they had heard from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They failed to discover it but reached the Yass River, which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> called the Boongaroom, and probably passed over the northern end of what is now the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is great scope for imparting these skills to Aboriginal and part Aboriginal students and even fully grown <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without provocation or cause of any kind, violence was done to a number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and a significant number of them were arrested, gaoled and humiliated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He fought hard for a royal commission into not only the Skull Creek incident, but also into reports of incidents involving drunkenness and violence among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the town of Laverton itself for several weeks prior to 5 January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The royal commission found that there were indeed a number of drunken <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They, the police, altered their original charges, stated to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fighting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> fighting police- a charge which was false although the royal commission found that there was one incident of violence, or more, at Skull Creek for which it could not say who was responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By any standards of conduct, towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, this constitutes the most deliberate attempt to pervert the administration of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further any question of excessive consumption of alcohol by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot be regarded as a cause for the conduct of the police at Skull Creek, nor was it regarded as such by the royal commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am aware that the Department’s Area Officer in Laverton at the time,  Mr Bachman,  had been working beyond the call of duty with the Laverton Police Sergeant for some weeks to overcome the problems associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was, however, sought by the imprisoned <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and through visiting them and hearing their stories was able to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the underlying causes are complex, the immediate cause of most of the troubles which we have described in this period was excessive drinking by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opening address to the conference on Monday I drew attention to the common but wrongly held view that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and drunkenness necessarily go together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Events as revealed by the Royal Commission show the innocent purpose for which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were moving from Warburton to Wiluna- to take part in their traditional rain making ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 28 police officers stationed at Laverton at the time of the Skull Creek incident, only ten had had any previous dealings with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other States, notably South Australia, have been active from time to time in setting up committees on which police and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are represented, to build better relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in fact, the officer who took charge of the police reinforcements at Laverton at the time of the Skull Creek incident had knowledge of customs and traditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, he most likely would have understood the purpose of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Skull Creek and have made appropriate inquiries before taking any action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were utterly and absolutely innocent in respect of Skull Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He, like myself, when we read of the incident at Skull Creek and made inquiries, was convinced that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Skull Creek were completely innocent of the charges made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of the Aboriginal people it is essential that the kind of incident that occurred at Laverton be brought to an end throughout the north and central part of Australia where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> still maintain some of their own tribal infrastructure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the policies of past governments -and I use the word ‘government’ in the plural- have been wrong in that they have endeavoured to disregard the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> own identity and systems of authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medibank would not have become a poor man’s health fund for the infirm, the unemployed, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government proudly announces these savings on education, especially as they affect <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of this year’s funds, $145.8m was to be spent through my Department either directly in the Northern Territory and by direct grants to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or organisations; through grants to the States or through related Government companies and statutory bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles of Aboriginal self-management and self-sufficiency are not only major objectives of the Government’s policy but will, it is believed, have a cumulative effect in freeing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our aim to find ways in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can play a more significant role in their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since my appointment as Minister, I have become aware of the need to institute policies at the national level to improve the relationships between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not dwell again on the statement I made concerning the royal commission’s report on the incidents at Laverton and Skull Creek in Western Australia other than to indicate that more needs to be done in achieving a greater level of understanding of the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by those who enforce the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent national seminar funded by the Government on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and alcohol recommended the use of predominantly Aboriginal staff in treatment programs; that courts and ambulances refer Aboriginal alcoholics and problem drinkers to Aboriginal services; and that Aboriginal/ police steering committees be set up in each State to co-operate on the legal aspects of drunkenness and arrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs has before it a reference on alcoholism and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, recently-arrived migrants and other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So is the miserable treatment applied to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any savings to this social expenditure now will be more than offset by the enormous increase in expenditure which will be required in future years because of the problems not being cured this year, because of lack of resources made available by this government now for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They expect a whole range of services for groups in the community which have special needs such as the old, the sick, the young, women and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Having regard to earlier statements made by the Minister on a timetable for the introduction of legislation to give effect to the granting of land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, can the Minister inform the House of the current situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the Government has authorised the introduction of legislation to recognise land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, those land rights being in respect of the reserves there and also traditional lands to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish to make claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the anxiety of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia that this legislation be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it became my responsibility I have taken it on myself to discuss the matter with many people, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and others, throughout the Northern Territory in particular, who are interested in the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without that provision the Bill really would have been worthless to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of this cooperative effort between this Government and the Northern Territory we will have a piece of legislation giving land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which will be able to last for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was thrust through without proper consultation with Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the arrangements of the Queensland Government some royalties are payable into a welfare fund for all the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Queensland as a result of mining at Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was pointed out to the Minister (a) that nobody would regard it as compensation for the owner of a property if that owner were European to inform him that his property was being disposed of for the benefit of all the people of Queensland and he would have his share in that, and (b) that it would be perfectly easy to use the royalties in a welfare fund as a means of reducing the payment of other consolidated revenue into the fund, to no ultimate real benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Minister made a priceless reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The questions to be answered were really: Firstly, do you regard the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Aurukun as having any title to the land of Aurukun; and secondly, have they been fully informed about what is happening to this land and do they consent to the arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be fair to say that Queensland follows the classic Australian pattern in acknowledging no Aboriginal land rights- I accept what is now happening, and has been happening for some time, in the Northern Territory- and regarding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in fact as a conquered people who may be dispossessed with impunity from what they regard as theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the answer to the question ‘Do Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have any title to Aurukun land?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three per cent of the net profits of the project would be spent for the benefit of 50 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queenslandminiscule individual benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a report tabled in the Queensland Parliament he said that the Aurukun <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> believed that they had not been consulted enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted this when I was a member of the select committees on the grievances of Yirrkala <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the voting rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were assumed by some officials to have no thoughts or opinions of their own, and the missionary was blamed for ‘stirring’- a great word in the Australian outback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was I who advised Yirrkala <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to petition the House of Representatives and to do so on a bark painting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lawyers who advised the companies were legitimate but anybody who advised the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was a ‘stirrer’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aurukun Presbyterian mission, which has been derided in this context, carries the burden of caring about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the burden of understanding them, the burden of listening to them, the burden of applying inspired thought to their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a pastoral people living off the land in their Aboriginal state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anthropologist Roheim long ago commented concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the central Australian desert: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Aurukun the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want a decent standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any standing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has to be deliberately enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The late Harold Holt had a Parliament unanimous in his support for a referendum to confer power to legislate for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all, including  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  have humbly to learn how to deal with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and we might begin by listening to them, acknowledging land rights and treating them unsentimentally and with dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I belong to an organisation called the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that last night the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued a statement about the acceptance of the general principles of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the astounding things about Aurukun is that it has shown how widespread throughout the Australian community is concern about Aboriginal affairs- concern about the fate and the future of Aboriginal people; concern about the relationship of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with their land and the impact of economic exploitation of that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does have the strength of the 1967 referendum behind it and the acknowledgment by the Government in the face of the overwhelming result of that referendum that it does have in Australia today the paramount responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, and that will be the thought which guides the Government in its future action in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we speak of giving equal opportunity for employment to an Aboriginal community, it is not enough to ask employers to throw open their employment books to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and say to them: ‘Write your name down and we will look at the prospects of employing you’ because of course, that ignores the lack of skills, the lack of training and the lack of prior opportunity to be trained in the kinds of skills that a mining operation would require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> seek protection for their land they seek protection for their spiritual affinity with the land, which was so adequately expressed by the honourable member for Fremantle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is a matter of high priority for my Government that not only must things like land rights be recognised; programs for bicultural understanding must also be implemented, reach a high level and pervade every section of the community from the children to the elderly, because only when the Australian people understand <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, their traditions, their culture, their spiritual affinity with land, can they understand what is involved in the granting of land rights and why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people persist in trying to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> like the Aurukun people when they come face to face with the demands of economic interests over their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to sustain a $32m cut in the appropriations for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let those honourable members and others in the community who are concerned for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia take note of this: Of every dollar spent on Aboriginal welfare only 13c ever reached the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The detailed appropriation of revenue in the Supply Bills does not give very much indication of what the Government will do in the next Budget but there are 2 areas in particular- the appropriation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the appropriation for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development- which draw to our attention once again the unfortunate statement of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  which was made on Thursday of last week, in which he announced such devastating cuts in so many areas of government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in opening the debate on the statement in this House last Tuesday I said what a short sighted policy this was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have this highlighted to us when we find the appropriation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so markedly cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the situation is that expenditure of money on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now could have such a wonderfully beneficial social effect on integrating the Aboriginal community into our Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By reducing the appropriation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as this Government is doing, as is witnessed in one of the Supply Bills before us, we can only come to the realisation that the Aboriginal community, growing in numbers, will become more and more bitter and that the expenditure on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by this Parliament over succeeding years will have to be greater in order to overcome those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no ways in which we can improve the quality of life of this country with better schools, better cities, better sewerage, a better deal for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, which I have already talked about, better telephones and postal services, better legal aid, better housing, better hospitals and better urban life generally other than through the intervention of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the details of the Supply Bills and say that particularly in the areas of appropriations for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and appropriations for environment, housing and community development, we see the first signs of real cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The television channel people required that the students should set up a tent in King George Square- a public square outside the City Hall, Brisbane, in the centre of the cityand that this would be a sort of tent embassy, as I understand the situation, in competition with a tent embassy already established in King George Square by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the discussion the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I am informed, were frequently referred to as ‘Abos’ in a most derogatory and offensive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they (the gentlemen) spoke of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> they spoke in disrespectful terms such as ‘Abos’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very real manifestation of the growing recognition throughout Australia of the validity and strength of Aboriginal society -which, I might add, is clearly acknowledged in the policy of the Government Parties which recognises a special obligation ‘to provide opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to preserve their traditions, languages and customs from further encroachment and destruction where possible ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He claimed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be better off and not worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Aurukun Associates Agreement Act, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act reek of paternalism and discrimination and stand in breach of United Nations and International Labour Organisation conventions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that the former Minister, the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson),  was a member of a Party which had had a successful policy with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How did the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs before him describe the former Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He really had a great interest in and a great sympathy for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he went into the field with money to burn, and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are now suffering from this fault of the Labor Party of rushing in to change all and to try to fix the lot of the Aborigine by spending money, just money alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a lack of direction and a lack of purpose in the policy of the Party and among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expects to sit down and to get his ‘sit down’ money as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> call it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard the honourable member for Hughes saying something about this despicable approach of paternalism towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole development happened so fast that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> went from a society which was relying very heavily on the assistance and guidance of Europeans to a position where the Europeans were standing aside as advisers if requested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party did the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a great disservice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must have money for the schemes, the ideas, the education, the housing, the health care- you name it- for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, to bring <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> up to a standard whereby they can hold their heads high in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let him get out in the spinifex and sit down amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the people who live there as I have done repeatedly for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is no expert on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a certain amount of premeditated abuse of committees investigating whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are getting real benefit from the money which has been appropriated on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the NACC should be investigated thoroughly to see whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are really gaining from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member started this disastrous program for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and the man who followed him in the portfolio admitted that it was disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many Aboriginal institutions or Aboriginal services should be investigated to see whether the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves are receiving the proper benefit, that the money is going to their benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the last Bill we debated in this place concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill which was produced by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That definition was originally bulldozed through by the Labor Party in spite of the objections by those people who live among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that at least 10 000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should look around this country as well before he starts reducing programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw the paddy waggons driven up and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> moved out of the beer garden at the Alice Springs Hotel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had the right to drink they would take a few flagons of wine with them into the scrub. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were charged by association in that they happened to be present when the police raided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things still go on but at least <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can get the correct advice and so forth and can be represented in the courts by legal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After a lot of hard negotiations, 12 square miles were cut out of that cattle station and sold on the condition that a dog-proof fence was put around the place and that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not take wood off the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs started the States grants set-up relating to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all realise that for many years up until the last few years nobody gave a damn about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal housing problem certainly has not been overcome, but the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have set up one of those so-called shocking organisations- a housing society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That housing society is trying to purchase houses around the towns to house <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in decent conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look at unemployment among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  said that the Labor Government caused unemployment among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just before the Labor Party came into government nobody gave a damn about whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the Labor Government provided finance to local government authorities and various organisations and set up special works projects to provide jobs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not have the figures with me, I know the amount outlayed in my area was considerable and certainly was helpful to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were able to get jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We went a long way towards providing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with an opportunity to take their rightful place in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody in the town knows that I have supported <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs which is looking into alcoholism among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hotel that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> frequent in Port Augusta where I live is right opposite my office, so I see what goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we may get away with discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who lack education and unsophisticated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> coming out of the bush, we cannot train them, educate them and throw them back on the scrap heap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to admit that while there has been progress over the past six or seven years in some aspects, in other aspects there has been a retrogression, and certainly in the north and the centre of Australia things for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not as good now as they were a few years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been in the field with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we seek to understand it and give full recognition to it within our community, then in this way we can seek to bring about fundamental social changes in what we as a government and as a people do in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will give traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> inalienable freehold title to land on reserves in the Northern Territory and provide machinery for them to obtain title to traditional land outside reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The coalition Parties’ policy on Aboriginal affairs clearly acknowledges that affinity with the land is fundamental to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ sense of identity and recognises the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to obtain title to lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives effect to that policy and, further, will provide <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory with the opportunity to claim and receive title to traditional Aboriginal land outside reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that this Bill will allow and encourage <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to give full expression to the affinity with land that characterised their traditional society and gave a unique quality to their life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of us now appreciate more sensitively than in the past that traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> think, feel and act about land according to a plan of life a world apart from ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> associate identifiable groups of people with particular ‘countries’ or tracts of territory in such a way that the link was publicly reputed to express both spiritual and physical communication between living people and their ‘dream time’ ancestors and between the ‘country’ as it now is and the ‘ ancestral ‘ country which had been given its names, its physical features, its founding stocks of food and water, and its owners and possessors by the ancestors themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1 973, the former Government appointed an Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner,  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward, to inquire into and report on ‘the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to rights in or in relation to land’ in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since my oppointment I have received numerous submissions on the proposed legislation and had many discussions with <span class="highlight">aborigines</span> and others, including members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and representatives of other interested groups in the Territory, and I have carefully considered their submissions, the recommendations of the Land Rights Commission and the terms of the legislation previously introduced to give effect to those recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though some of the Indian people of Canada, as of the United States of America, earlier had some recognition of their rights in land through treaties, the Eskimo people, like the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory, have had no legal recognition of their traditional rights in the domestic law of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides that the lands described in the Schedule being existing reserves and the Hermannsburg and Santa Teresa missions in Central Australia and the Delissaville area near Darwin will be vested in Aboriginal land trusts, composed entirely of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in the area concerned, who will hold title on behalf of the traditional owners and those other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> entitled by Aboriginal tradition to use and occupy those lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fundamental change in social thinking in Australia to recognise that within our community there are some people, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who live by a unique and distinct system of customary law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill by clause 47 requires the Land Commissioner to inquire into the likely extent of traditional land claims by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to alienated Crown land and to report to the Minister, from time to time, the results of his inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This important provision allows a level of protection hitherto unknown over land held by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and will allow them to consider mining plans carefully before they assent to exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have agreed to mineral exploration we would expect, as  Mr Justice  Woodward proposed, that development of any economic discovery made would follow, subject only to agreement on terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the added safeguard for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, miners and government of an independent inquiry in the difficult and delicate area of national interest, the provisions relating to mining on Aboriginal land are in accord with the broad statement of principles outlined by me to representatives of the mining industry last March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will continue to receive royalties from mining operations on Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be for the Government to determine the proportion of royalty that will be payable to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in excess of the current rates, fixed by law, should the Government determine that a higher rate of royalty will apply to particular minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main differences between this Bill and that presented last October by the previous Government are, briefly, that: We have clearly defined the nature of the Aboriginal land rights we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with traditional rights to use and occupy that land- 1 might add, a fundamental provision strangely missing in the Labor Government’s Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have provided for an inquiry to be made where Aboriginal consent to mining is withheld and where it may be appropriate in the national interest to over-ride Aboriginal wishes; we have also provided for an arbitrator to be appointed where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and mining com- panies are unable to reach agreement on terms or mining development; and the Bill gives scope for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to participate in this most important legislative process in particular in relation to the protection of sacred sites, in measures to protect wildlife in Aboriginal lands, in the control of entry into those lands and adjacent waters and in the handling of applications for land to meet the needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in towns and other areas where traditional claims cannot be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be full consultation with the Territory Assembly and between the Assembly and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in preparing Territory legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some have expressed surprise that a Liberal-Country Party government should have made the decision to grant land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Securing land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory is a significant expression of this objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is a major step forward for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory not only for this generation but also for future generations who will benefit from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to demands by the Queensland Government to have wages, earned by 200 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> working as extras on a film being made in Queensland, paid to the Government of that State and not to those who have earned the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> registered for employment with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations at 2 April 1976 was 10 335. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of reasons, including the isolation of many Aboriginal communities, and the lack of awareness among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of their unemployment benefits entitlements, many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not register for employment and the actual number unemployed may well be substantially greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department estimates, on the basis of 1971 Census data, that the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now in the labour force is a little under 35 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-56-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs seen a Press report stating that, as a result of the reductions in money to be appropriated for Aboriginal affairs, over 1000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite incorrect that one thousand or anywhere near that number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be unemployed as a result of the decisions announced by the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson),  spoke at length about Aboriginal sites and deplored the fact that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly may have some authority with regard to assisting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in declaring and having declared sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What does he know about the Northern Territory and what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves know about their own law, whether it is their land law or their Aboriginal sites? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Year after year the Liberal and Country Parties fought for the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decide who went into these parts of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it should be ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this talk about federalism goes by the board in the light of the expressed will of the people 9 years ago on the question of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike many homes built previously for Aboriginal communities, these homes have been built according to the choice of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and they are proud of their achievement, and happy to live in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Budget takes $33m from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, it gives $50m in superphosphate bounties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is only one test of the inhumanity and dishonesty of this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a year when the profits of Comalco Ltd doubled in 6 months that company becomes the recipient of tax concessions, whereas with one-third of all Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unemployed, the Budget allocation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is cut by $33m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is it that only one Government supporter has openly criticised the deal the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are getting? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the money is allocated the Government wants to make sure that it will get to the Aboriginal people and do some good and not be frittered along the way in administrative costs or go to a contractor who will not provide any benefit at all to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable members would agree that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be most unlikely to be in income brackets where they would be able to obtain full benefit from the old family rebate scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had been employed on special working projects, many of which had already been suspended when this Liberal-Country Party Government came to power, were waiting for some indication that this Government cared for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- this was admitted by the Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairswas a disaster and was seen to be a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He read it in support of his argument that there had been a leak from the Hay report which was investigating expenditures on housing committees and other instrumentalities which are supposed to be assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a report to the Government which will see that the money that is voted for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> goes wholly to them so that they will get the greatest advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need people with knowledge, experience and sympathy to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to see that the money is spent in the right way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spending on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is decimated; real overseas aid falls to a lower proportion of national income than that which has applied for over 10 years; the real value of family allowances is already falling; a decision about student allowances is still deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Funds for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- mainly for Aboriginal housinghave been reduced by $10m, or $52m overall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government conducts an inquiry if it wants to cut money off programs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it does not do that when it wants to grant concessions or largesse to mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Canberra Press Gallery, of course, looks for controversy, but it is very interesting to see that it has found very little to criticise in the Budget except, I must admit, the question of funding for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that the Budget is persimonious to the point of being vicious in its treatment of those people such as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the unemployed, and particularly the young unemployed, whose interests the Government ought to feel obliged to protect and to defend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know the Government has said that possibly it will look at some things later on, but I know the great concern that is felt not only by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves but also by those people who are concerned about the Aboriginal question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable gentleman had read the Budget Papers and had understood the policies of the Government he would have realised that the provision of an increase of $1.56m in the expenditure under that item reflects the concern which this Government has for overcoming the unemployment problem amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is also concerned to see that its programs are implemented on a basis which will provide training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and a real prospect of permanent employment after the special works projects’ have, been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It investigated, amongst other things, training programs, vocational training and general employment support for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have gone out of my way to inform the organisations operating in both those fields that they will continue to function as autonomous services, run by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall the inquiry that was instituted earlier this year, headed by an eminent anthropologist,  Dr Les  Hiatt,  Chairman  of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, and supported by 3 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time, I believe, that such an inquiry about Aboriginal affairs has included among its membership a clear preponderance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself indicates the strength of the Government’s conviction that the success of Aboriginal programs will in the end result from the involvement and participation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, particularly in the making of recommendations to the Government on national policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country parties recognise that if a policy of self-management is to be effective, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must play a leading role in their affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will include <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> playing a significant role: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, again, is in fulfilment of our philosophic belief that success in Aboriginal affairs will come about largely through involving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, Aboriginal organisations and Aboriginal communities in the activities of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that employment and training schemes will be urgently investigated with the aim of increasing job opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that we should be aiming to get private employers to accept <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on a basis on which they will train the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and give them a real opportunity of permanent employment at the end of the particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we have seen quite exciting prospects for it and a readiness by private employers to embark upon this new field of employment support and training for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the last ten or fifteen minutes we listened to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  explaining the inexplicable and trying to justify the fact that the Government has reduced the total expenditure on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by $33m or thereabouts at a time when, in the logic of inflation, it should have increased it by at least $20m and when it should have taken the programs that have been or were being launched and expanded them by providing for a further expenditure of perhaps another $20m or $30m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of whether it is in relation to infant welfare, the care of the aged or the supplying of hospitals and services, we still do not perform to the same standard in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as we do in respect of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Differences arise from the very nature of the communities in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people there are not traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it reduces the availability of services to the whole community but particularly to those most vulnerable to hardship notably <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the unemployed and migrants, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> it means a 15 per cent reduction in cash terms; in regard to housing loans by the banks it means a 30 per cent reduction in cash terms; in regard to welfare housing payments to the States it means a 13 per cent reduction in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will know that cuts in the expenditure of the 1976-77 Budget affect the little people- pensioners, women, children, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants, the sick and the infirm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have promised that the wicked Government will cut expenditure on education, legal aid, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and on childhood, old people, and other welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either directly or by inference, he said he would increase expenditure on schools, roads, health services, sewerage, environment, women and children, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the unemployed, public works, construction, shipbuilding, Medibank, State funds, growth centres, pensions, supporting mothers, unemployed school leavers, aged persons homes, destitute and lonely men- that includes most of the Opposition- supporting fathers, migrants, defence, nursing homes, hospitals, school dental services, refuges for women, national highways and last but not least, women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question I placed on notice about unratified International Labour Organisation conventions, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on the last sitting day told me that the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, which is relevant to the land rights of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, cannot yet be ratified by Australia because one State has not yet agreed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Labor Party towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at this very moment smaks of double standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw on  Monday Conference  last night the sort of stirring up that is going on by the intellectual Left with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, they seek to persuade them that, politically speaking, there are no poor, no aged, no sick, no <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, no immigrants, no people seriously squeezed by inflation, not many for whom unemployment is a major issue, no one whose health, education, food, shelter, protection from economic abuse or exploitation, or even survival, depends on the services of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it reduces the availability of services to the whole community but particularly to those most vulnerable to hardship notably <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the unemployed and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the only way in which we can make significant payments for foreign aid, for assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and a number of other groups in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done a tremendous amount to overcome some of the difficulties facing the disadvantaged and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constantly maligned <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are squeezed even further by a reduction in their health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about health services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice to say that society in general has failed to adapt to the housing, information and language difficulties of migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and locals and the shifting geographical pattern of demand for labour changing emphasis in rural production and outlets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that from time to time unnecessary ill will is created in our society as a result of Aboriginal grants being made to persons who do not appear to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in response to this principle and any government’s endeavours to uplift <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we want neither overindulgent idealism nor the over-zealous pursuit of economic efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, also, are concerned that the funds available are being spent with greatest direct benefit to their people, and not lost along the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hay  was appointed by the Government last January to inquire into the effectiveness of the delivery of services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I announced  Mr Hay’s  appointment to conduct this inquiry I said that the purpose of the examination was to ensure that the funds being made available for the Aboriginal community were being spent for the maximum benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were to assess the effectiveness of the services financed, to recommend improvements in the delivery of services and their financial arrangements in the interest of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the community at large, and to establish whether there were any areas of waste and inefficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis, it will be seen, is upon the effectiveness of services delivered and the interest of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a conjunction which is of course deliberate and a reflection of the Government’s obligation towards the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understandable that the temporarily reduced funds for housing alarmed and worried many people, not least those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in need of housing, for without adequate housing there can be only limited improvements in health, limited opportunity for children to succeed at school and limited hope of gaining regular employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The link between education and employment is possibly of greater importance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than others as formal education is brought more within then- reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen a number of examples of Aboriginal community spirit matched by government funds producing just such self-esteem and a new sense of social involvement where previously <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were out on the fringe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also involve <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the budgetary process for mutual agreement on how funds are to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reviews will also ensure that funds allocated in this and future years will be used most effectively for direct benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with as little administrative outlay as efficiency permits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extra $ 1.56m was provided for employment support programs which will enable funding support of a new initiative in placing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with private employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more important, I can assure you, is the intention of this Government to see that Aboriginal affairs programs directly relate to Aboriginal needs while increasing the involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the concept of selfmanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at this mission are very well fed and complacent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless something is done about it, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and in the north of Australia will have no future at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wanted to slaughter the cattle to feed their own people at Yuendumu, Haasts Bluff and Papunya but were not allowed to do so because of some administrative bungle in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and in the north of Australia are now going down hill at a rate which is without precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members to compare that statement with a statement made by  Senator Bonner  in another place when speaking a short time ago on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That despondency and confusion are a direct result of the policy of the Labor Party towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could receive plenty of money for doing nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  who will be speaking next in the debate, led the van in demanding that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have grog rights when he was the  Deputy Chairman  of the parliamentary committee concerned with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was something that was pushed on to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> far too soon, just as so many other things were pushed on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the Labor Government far too soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy should have been one of moving forward slowly and allowing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to develop at their own rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these things and all that money should not have been pushed on to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before they could handle them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  spent much of his Budget speech criticising the Government’s attitude towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition made a speech which included a section on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> covering about  2Vi  pages of Hansard, which is a passage of considerable size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government realised that there was very much waste and loss of financial benefit to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves want to work rather than receive ‘sit down money’ or unemployment benefits, and we heard criticism this afternoon by a former Labor Minister of the fact that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not being given work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable members on the Opposition benches and certain sections of the Press were only too ready to accuse the Government of savage cuts in funds to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when the Budget was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These homes are being constructed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with regard for the special needs of the Aboriginal people who will occupy them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the various areas where building societies have been established and efforts made to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, great concern has been expressed to me about what the future will hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an area where housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is extremely bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many areas of my electorate, such as at Coober Pedy, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> utilise this sort of accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders dealt with  the question of infant mortality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make an observation, because it seems to me that there are too many hear, hears’ in this chamber whenever anybody suggests that some aspect of affairs, especially those related to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and mining projects in the Northern Territory, should be handed to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have spoken about integrating <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have spoken about all the decisions we will make on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the drop of a hat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the reason for the emphatic decision of the Australian people was the plain view that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are entitled to a new basis of treatment, and that new basis of treatment is compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not let us be mealy-mouthed about the fact that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are a conquered people and have always been treated as a conquered people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was Minister for Education the first decision that we made regarding <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned their right, if Aboriginal parents nominated it, to an education in their own languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said: ‘Oh dear, how dreadful’, quite failing to realise that in all our dealing with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> we had suppressed their languages, we had denied them their right to be considered as a distinctive people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is just as mystic as the idea that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> own it because of some possession in a dreamtime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we know that we can devise a tribal title and that we can regard <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as having some kind of collective ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people say: Let them decide whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have sacred sites or not’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever we are aiming to do for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, we have to regard it as axiomatic that we owe them some compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes into the north of my State of Western Australia one sees rock paintings, which do not date back out of the lifetime of people now alive, of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> chained together and being pushed into gorges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some problems with which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the report on voting rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was being debated in this chamber I did not believe that the first thing that should happen to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was that drinking rights should be extended to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth and the States have been very much slower in giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> anything that would cost the Treasury anything or in acknowledging their title to the ownership of anything in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned at the outset, it was for this reason that the matter of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was delegated to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one other reason why the Australian people gave this Federal Parliament power to deal with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was that they believed that at the national level there could really be a scientific attack on Aboriginal needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might also mention now for the information of honourable members, in view of a question asked of me some time ago, that the nutritional program for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, administered by my colleague the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  resulted in an expenditure last year of $200,000 and that it is to be continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statement I made to the House today about the additional $2 5 m to be provided for Aboriginal affairs in pursuance of the undertaking by the Treasurer, I think all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and others interested in their welfare can be well satisfied with the commitment of this Government to their advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the kind of scheme that we are sponsoring throughout Australia in order to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> opportunities for employment in areas of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see real opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in places where there was not opportunity previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leaveThe fact that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs has chosen to produce this interim report on alcohol problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory shows how seriously the problem is regarded by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live in a hot, arid climate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are obviously influenced by the heavy drinking atmosphere around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal drinking appears to reflect despondency arising from the loss of traditional land and life style; the breakdown of tribal law; the ineffectiveness of the white man’s law in remote regions; massive unemploymentAborigines account for probably more than SO per cent of the work force; and poor socioeconomic conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told of a communityand I quote- ‘collapsing in a great, bloody, brawling, sprawling drunken heap’; that white men are selling flagons of wine to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at $20 a flagon; that one Aboriginal drunk pick-up service picks up 50 to 60 people a night; that one Northern Territory town has 52 liquor outlets; and we were told of a community rationing beer to 12 cans per adult per day and 24 cans on Saturdays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leaveThe House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs would not have brought forward an interim report had it not believed that it was absolutely urgent to overcome this alcohol problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report deals with something which is more the symptom than the cause of the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final report of the Committee will have to deal with the more basic forces which have led to this problem arising, that is, the disintegration of the traditional way of life of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look specifically at the actual figures as outlined in the Budget we will see that there has been a reduction, for example, in the monetary allocation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I would say only that the Government has done a great deal to prune the administrative elements in terms of the funds  that are going to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done this to make sure that funds that are allocated by this Parliament to be spent get where they are needed to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recently announced additional spending in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and increases in the Tertiary Education Allowances Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He might be able to influence his colleagues to accept the view that an effective legal aid scheme ought to be on the basis that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get as much money as they need to run a proper legal aid service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the guidelines now suggested <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are encouraged first to explore the other legal aid services available in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are saying that to be dominated in this sense means that they lose their integrity, their individuality and their ability to run their own legal aid system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, have the States agreed to pick up the cost of providing legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were issued to the Aboriginal legal aid services about 2 months ago- not as a condition of funding by the Commonwealth but, as their name implies, as a guide to the services so that they might identify and respond to areas of priority in the provision of legal aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why it was not extended to the Aboriginal community was that if the European basic wage was given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over many of the years since 1946, they would be receiving, as sufferers from tuberculosis, an amount far in advance of what they had been receiving over a great part of that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probable that because these strategies were not applied with the same resolution to the Aboriginal community in relation to tuberculosis, almost the only sufferers from tuberculosis in the Australian community are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that a select committee of the House of Representatives revolutionised the constitutional status of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Select Committee on Voting Rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the Northern Territory- were delivering the same sort of health care to animals instead of to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the RSPCA would prosecute them ‘, Professor Fred Hollows, the director of an eye-health survey and treatment team at present in Central Australia, says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tracoma- a curable eye disease also known as ‘sandy blight ‘-which can lead to blindness, was raging, more than half the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under 21 having active trachoma follicles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show central Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be crippled by ill-health, with diseases and conditions of a sort almost eliminated in white Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With adult <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in these settlements, virtually all had trachoma scarring and the development of a pannus (a white band, actually a scar, spreading down the eye). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report in the  Canberra Times  of 19 October goes on to say that it was one thing to put magnificent hospitals in places like Alice Springs and Katherine but <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could not use those institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is true of people of inadequate background, inadequate education and so on who are European, how much more is it true that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not sense that they need to go in to report at clinics that they have such things as leprosy, serious as that is, let alone some of the lesser things, such as trachoma, which by slow development can cause blindness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have developed because they do not have any tradition of stationary living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that only immediate action by the Government would stop Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from destroying themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government to budget adequately for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders presented a report entitled  The Environmental Conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the Preservation of their Sacred Sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health and physical environment problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders were considered in depth- at page 79 of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand there is to be, apparently, a continuation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and on the other there is to be a new statutory committee which is to be composed predominantly of Aboriginal people- some 9 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Torres Strait Islanders, five of whom will be delegates from a re-formed National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also acknowledge the very valuable service rendered by those distinguished people who were led by  Dr Hiatt-  all of whom are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was once a large tribe of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It promised to maintain federal funds for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; it has cut them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory there are 1501 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> between the ages of 25 years and 29 years, 1849 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the ,20 years to 24 years age group, 225 1 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the 15 years to 19 years age group, 281 1 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the 10 years to 14 years age group, 3348 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the 5 years to 9 years age group, and 4029 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the 4 years and under age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tremendous need among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, apart from literacy in their own languages and in English, for special forms of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our  experience one feature of successful schemes for the education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been the recognition that a special approach is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the number of jobs available to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could be increased by vocational training of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in such fields as truck driving, mechanical maintenance, building construction and bookkeeping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it then became clear that this college might become basically a training college for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been a number of other investigations such as that by the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the migrant task force report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is abundantly clear that whatever vocational training is carried out must be tailored to the needs of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in their own communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  has developed a reputation, very justifiably, for careful and analytical statement and for the recognition of the fact that no political parties can stunt in this Parliament with any veracity on the subject of the position of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was no vocational education for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, that was after 23 years of the previous Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many areas there are problems in getting any education at all to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not common for the Minister to try to score Party points on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our puzzles about policies on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are likely to be such that those who attempt to will usually find very great disappointments as they try to find what is the best thing to be done for a community which has a background very different from our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Government has undertaken a program to treat trachoma and other eye diseases amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A surgical team from the Australian College will undertake a series of eye operations on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in remote areas of South Australia who come from the central region of that part of the inland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To further ensure that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with traditional rights in land guide the action of land councils, an amendment will provide that a land council should express the wishes as well as the opinions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in its area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of representations received from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the Government has reconsidered its earlier decision that the councils should not handle land claims and that the Aboriginal Legal Aid Services instead should assist in the formulation and presentation of claims for recognition of traditional Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To help ensure that the land councils administer land in conformity with the wishes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with traditional interests in land, the power of a land council to delegate its powers to its members or its staff will be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments are proposed to those sections dealing with the membership of land trusts, land councils and the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account Advisory Committee to provide that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are traditional owners of land in the relevant area are eligible for membership even if they live outside the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, negotiations between the companies and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> break down- which experience to date suggests will not occur- the Bill will provide that a lease of Aboriginal land may be granted on the recommendation of an arbitrator, if he determines that a land council has unreasonably refused to consent to the grant of a lease of land required to meet these commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That situation will also apply in the case of the Ranger project where the Government is morally bound by an arrangement entered into by the previous Government, so that if the Ranger uranium deposits are developed in the light of the second report of the Fox Commission of Inquiry then the Ranger companies will be obliged by the Act to reach agreement with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> concerned if their pending Aboriginal land claim over part of the Ranger project area is successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus any agreement with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will take account of royalties payable to Government and to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and, should arbitration be necessary, those considerations would be taken into account by the arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  an extract from the first report of  Mr Justice  Woodward on Aboriginal land rights, entitled  <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Their Land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Issue entry permits to non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> visiting Aboriginal lands and arrange for Rangers and others to check the permit system is observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members and the public will have noticed the huge advertising campaign undertaken by the Australian Mining Industry Council, allegedly costing over $ lm, to put across its point of view that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not retain the right to veto mining on their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Bill, however, provides that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter of grave consequence is that the definition of ‘Aboriginals’ in the 1976 Bill is limited to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living within the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, this smacks of paternalism and discrimination and portends perhaps the Minister’s fears of the articulate and educated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the south influencing their northern brothers and sisters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be the only people who will do so and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory will quickly judge the motive behind their gutter campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to note that one of the amendments which the Minister has moved and to which the Opposition has taken exception requires the land councils not only to ascertain and to express the opinion of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also to obtain knowledge of the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whom they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who have something on offer and who want to mine the land say to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: ‘We will pay you this much money and we will do that much for you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have always found themselves in the sad position that their defenders often had to be the people who were also selling them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that one of the missionaries in Yirrkala, when giving evidence to our Committee, said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not use the land and that they do not have a sense of ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the area of Aboriginal affairs, in which there has emerged in essence a bipartisan approach, an attempt to divide the nation or to divide parties against parties, persons against persons and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is not a very good ploy and is quite unbecoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then goes on to deal with other significant areas- land claimed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, including vacant Crown land, and pastoral leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say in response to the remarks by honourable members opposite that history will record that it was the Liberal and National Country Parties which pursued and brought to finality land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that it was a government of our persuasion which commissioned the Woodward report, and that it is a government of our persuasion which brought in this legislation that was enacted into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes clear and emphasises something which I see as important and which  Mr Justice  Woodward saw as important, and that is a recognition of a fundamental principle to Aboriginestheir sense of Aboriginality was their affinity with land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> know they have land as of right they will feel that special affinity with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly will not help overcome some of the basic problems and deprivations which we know exist among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in certain circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy document is one that I would commend to people to read because it recognises the importance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> gaining their inalienable title to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the connection of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with their land is timeless, commencing before birth and continuing after death …  his connection with it is not broken by the fact he may have lived away from it for many years <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have so far come across no case in which ownership of land has been disputed among full blooded <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They make clear the importance of traditional owners in the structure of these Bills, the importance of land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the importance of giving them a purpose in life and an understanding of living and achieving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 7 (6), which deals with the constitution of Aboriginal land trusts, emphasises that all members of a land trust shall be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in the area of the land council in the area of which the land of the land trust is situated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision is also important in relation to traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of examination would only delay further the opportunity for us to be able to give land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I saw an interesting program on  This Day Tonight  last week in which a couple of Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were shown landing at Dover in the English Channel and planting the Aboriginal flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years absolutely nothing was done for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a race we have not even had the decency to record the history of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that those who have read the books written by Professor Rowley will remember that he made mention of how we have taken the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of our history books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a segment during a news program tonight about what some educationists have had to say about our attitude to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in our education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been claimed that if it had not been for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> during the early days when the white man was hugging the coast of Australia the white man never would have left the coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The early settlers who broke out from the coast did so mainly with the assistance of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The early settlers relied upon the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to find water holes and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degradation of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has continued right through to the present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been claimed that in the early days of the settlement of the Eyre Peninsula, which is in my electorate, when the Aboriginal people were defending their rights and standing up to the settlers, the settlers had a big drive on horseback and drove a large group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> towards the cliffs and forced them over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been subjected to all the prejudice and hatred that the white man can muster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the Americans recorded their history, whereas we in Australia have not recorded the history of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know what happened to the American Indians; so what chance did the Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not mounted and the weapons they had were much more primitive than those of the American Indians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ tribal structures were much smaller. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> became a completely dispossessed people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years the attitude of the white population was to assimilate the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into white society or to let them die out peacefully- and sometimes not quite so peacefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with the dispossession that had taken place, the matter of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> became of great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a decision made within the very limited framework in which he had to work- the European law, the white man’s law, under which the rights of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were given short shrift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also understand that under this Bill control over roads through Aboriginal areas will be taken away from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provided however that … no ordinance shall have any effect so as to diminish any benefit conferred upon <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by this Act or to restrict any Land Council, Land Trust or the Commission in the discharge of their respective functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The control by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of all roads passing through Aboriginal lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all people who have placed the views of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> first- hot the views of the mining interests or of the pastoral interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our first objective, surely, is to do what is best for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to look to their real advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill envisages acquisition of proper dwelling areas- sit down places is what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> call them- for other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Bill is for the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have to remember that they are different from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> most people know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the Australian people come into contact with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Redfern or Moree or perhaps as tourists in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying for one moment that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, other than the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, do not have needs and do not need, require and deserve benefits and help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and about maintaining their rights over traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What is best for these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be maintaining for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the integrity of their traditional reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not just little islands in a sea of European development, but something which can be traditionally Aboriginal until the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are ready to take the change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No big mining venture in a reserve can be conducted without destroying the traditional Aboriginal society and the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are associated with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I hope that things will improve, but on the last occasion I was at Groote Eylandt there was starvation among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for the first time in memory- starvation at a time when there was a flood of unaccustomed money coming in, but gambling and other things had taken away its impact for good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this outstation movement which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have chosen for themselves in these reserves illustrates the only real hope they have of coming successfully through the transition from thenway of life to our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that we must give to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> control over their own property and their own destiny, but if that means permission to barter it away then it will be bartered away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in good faith perhaps, make bargains whose impact they do not understand, and we in good faith sometimes believe that they understand what they are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill there is not enough protection for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, almost against themselves in a way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would Uke to have seen the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the reserves having full mining rights, but I would not Uke to have seen them with the ability to barter those rights away in such a fashion as to bring in intensive industries and destroy their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear the pressure that will come from other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the people who come up into the Northern Territory from the south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pastor Paul Albrecht and his missionary colleagues,  Mr Stoll  and  Mr Ziersch,  base their opposition to Aboriginal land rights … on misconceptions and misreadings both of the legislation which has been proposed and the response to it by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their opposition is also motivated by a well disguised self-interest and political conservatism which has allowed them to confuse their political support for the Country Party with their responsibilities to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any national acquisition of land from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> must bring with it fair compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In circumstances where Aboriginal land is used to exploit natural resources the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> receive continuing and realistic royalties, together with funding for housing, job and vocational training, employment, social development and cultural opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves place no store on such assurances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I am too cynical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should go up to Areyonga and some of the areas in which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being treated like second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is too easy to see the NTLA engaging in shameful acts of paternalism and political censorship by refusing entry to people who it believes would be ‘bad’ for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, such as people it deems to be stirrers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally regarded as the weakest such legislation in Australia, and not one site has been declared in the last 18 months despite constant requests from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no comprehension of the real meaning to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, it has been left to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which has indicated that it intends insisting that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> walk and only use traditional weapons when they hunt, whereas at present they use cars and rifles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To tell <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to hunt on foot with traditional weapons is therefore ludicrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly would like to ask the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  to go to Areyonga and try to get the local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to show him their sacred sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the introduction of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, it is hoped, will give Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the ability to practise their law and traditions on their own land in their own manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1975 Bill on the same matter, which was introduced by the Labor Party, would have been a disaster for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans in the Territory, had it got through the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans in the Territory know that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much work has been done on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to find out about the implications and the meaning of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that this Bill will satisfy the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ traditional land aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only very recently I heard a definition from a man who is not supporting me in what I as a Territorian am trying to do for traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of Aborigine’, which I heard very recently was: Someone of Aboriginal descent who is accepted as an Aborigine by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community in which he lives’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill concerns the granting of traditional land in the Northern Territory for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and for other purposes in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally reported from various sources that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> support the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> welcomed land rights; but they did not understand in the first place the land councils as envisaged in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence the very real danger is that the setting up of a council or advisory group to decide land rights will bring bloodshed and decimation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LUTHER: That’s their idea, but <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> think this way: They should give us our land, helping us in various ways, and then someone should be here to assist and look after us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are thinking is, ‘Why do those people there want to have the say to kick out people (Mission) who are valuable to us?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Aboriginal law does not permit an organisation or a body made up of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from different clans to speak on behalf of - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a letter here signed by a  Mr Huey,  the Assistant Director, southern branch of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which is dated 3 November 1976 and in which he says that50 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> representing communities- the sorts of ones that I have mentionedspoke with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it is a matter of looking after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or whites, the Territory has to be financed, and we have the resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These developments, as has happened in the past, have supplied money and jobs for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as well as for whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the hate we have heard poured out tonight by certain honourable members for mining companies and, needless to say, pastoralists is quite stupid, because when one gets into the Territory one finds that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who might be working with the Yuendumu mining company, at Macarthur River or on a cattle station do not make these complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are made by people who are advising the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> what to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on his tremendous efforts to meet all opinion- our opinion, on the one hand, and the opinion of others, on the other hand- in trying to see that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory get control and correct management of what is theirs and that they do not get short changed on any mining deals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in favour of that, and every mining company I have seen in the Northern Territory since I can remember has said: ‘We admit that there is a duty on our part to see that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> receive the correct royalty or the correct percentage of what should be their right with regard to their land ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to join issue with the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  on anything that relates to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are 127 people in this House and we all need to be very modest in assuming that any of us are speaking for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we get from that result an authority to start divesting ourselves of our responsibilities towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of these spokesmen were ever <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this question was asked at every place as we came down the coast later some of the organisations were shamed into putting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the witness box, and then one realised why they had not done so before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> never stuck to anybody’s policy line- not the policy line of the Communist Party, the Labor Party or the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said genuinely and authentically what they believed, and the authentic voice of the Aborigine as I have heard it through interpreters- many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are magnificent orators in their own languages- never, but never, utters the slogans of New York Black Power, nor the opinions of mining companies, or of any of the other voices that are presented to us here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land rights question on the whole brings to us the authentic voice of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> because the people with a claim to land in reality tend to be authentically Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both in this letter to the Minister and in the evidence given before the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders whose  chairman  is an Aboriginal,  Senator Bonner,  there seemed to be expressed a distrust of handing things over to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enter on pastoral leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That funds be provided to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to sustain themselves on any land which they are given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout our history we have not proved ourselves to be in any respect particularly sensitive towards the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who recently cheered us with the statement that he made about the national trachoma and eye health program in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, supported Fred Hollows, who I understand started his work under the Labor Government in the eye survey of Aboriginal people and others in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the tactful aspects of the activities of the body conducting that program was that it recognised that all people in the Australian outback and not just <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were in need of attention to their eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the whole of this operation began not particularly with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in mind but with the situation in mind that there were 280 ophthalmologists in Sydney but not one in Wagga and various other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, this body began thinking in terms of a country operation and, when it was suggested that the people most in need were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, there was agreement on that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government backed the action and this body began to develop the tact of not being divisive when it was on a station but of testing mum’s eyes, dad’s eyes and the children’s eyes and providing them with glasses and then having access to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What depressed me in the accounts I heard of the operations was the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sitting about on stations who had pearly white eyes, which was simply indicative of cataracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it was established by that expedition that all the people in the Northern Territory were particularly sensitive to the health needs of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, even when they were as completely obvious as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are large numbers of European people who do not have normal social associations with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and therefore do not know what they think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not have to be remote from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in cities for that to be the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the present time need a great deal of discrimination in their favour, and we did establish a system of compensatory education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I encountered in the Northern Territory the slogan that we were discriminating for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and so we were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that many people who attacked me in the Northern Territory- they might have been quite righthad no idea that there was any case for any sort of compensation for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 66 gives <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> control of entry into Aboriginal land and hence control of existing roads other than the public access roads I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great play was made, particularly by honourable members on my side of the House, of the concern of the Government and of individual members to protect the traditional interests of traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bill entrenches in Australian domestic law for the first time the customary rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> according to their traditional interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might look at this legislation and the framework of it as creating within our framework of domestic law an umbrella’ underneath which the customary interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might prevail and be protected by Australian domestic law for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Justice  Woodward was thoroughly conscious of the need to provide within Australia domestic law for the traditional interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out to me tonight by traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the top end of the Northern Territory that the Aboriginal concept of the custodian of their land has a close similarity to our notion within our law and according to our concept of a trustee of land for beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out that there could be a conjunction of Aboriginal interest and Australian domestic legal interest through the identity of the Aboriginal who is the custodian and who might also be the trustee for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of their land rights through membership of the land trust I feel that whatever might be said about the material provided to the House by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  from those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> around Hermannsburg, there will not be the friction they fear when this legislation is put into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar always speaks from a depth of understanding and knowledge about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It perplexed many people as to how to balance the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the peculiar and unique nature of their interest in and and the demands of the whole Australian society for development where it is in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was proposed to  Mr Justice  Woodward that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should also have the rights to minerals within their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was not prepared to accept that, but did see it as absolutely necessary that there be adequate protection for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through the veto power and the other protections which he indicated and which are written into this legislation to see that Aboriginal interests are provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government against the background of those observations will see that the land councils, the body representing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, will be centrally located in the administration of the ordinances in all these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal councils can be formed where 10 adult <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in a particular area desire that an Aboriginal council be formed in respect of that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The necessity for that has been recognised by a great many people who have studied the deficiencies in the provision of legal aid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to put <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the positon that they must work to get unemployment benefit because, as the honourable gentleman will appreciate, that is really a non-sequitur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we want to do is to see that money goes into communities which will finance worthwhile projects and can employ those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who cannot obtain employment at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the ensuing debate my colleague, the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  expressed the Government’s concern at the health problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, particularly such diseases as trachoma and its incidence in central and northern Australia amongst the remote communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s total funding for health services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for 1976-77 is $ 15.9m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee already has in hand a study of alcohol problems amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the course of which evidence on health factors has been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs will therefore find that report of value as well as the Senate Committee’s report on environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders which make some specific recommendations on Aboriginal health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who suffer from them, I understand, is quite large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> including traditional healers can participate in the development and delivery of health care services to their own communities, and in any modification of existing services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have a great respect for their traditional healers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have tended to believe in the past that if we set up facilities for the whole community in the Northern Territory or elsewhere then they were accessible to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the medical service of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress has on its clinic books some 8600 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which shows that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have confidence in the form of medicine which goes to them, and they are more diffident about approaching organisations like hospitals and so on at Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member expressed concern that the Legislative Assembly might legislate in some way to deprive <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the right of access to their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had said that they did not want a remote land council deciding who went onto their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hughes went on to say that, by the same token, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would not welcome decisions being made on this matter by remote Darwin-based bureaucrats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Country-Liberal Party in the Northern Territory which defended the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to decide who went on to their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at sub-clause 24(a) of the Bill they will see that it enables <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to make a register of people whom they consider to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people entitled to this land are traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am worried always that people who have only a slight mixture of Aboriginal blood, because they are perhaps better educated in our European sense or because they are slicker, might go to the Territory and impose upon the true and traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to whom this Bill refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill betrays the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who could be overwhelmed or taken to the cleaners by the part-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who could come up from the south and who are without traditional ties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are entitled to those lands are the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not blow-ins from the south or blow-ins from another area, whether they be full-blood or part-blood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I hope at any rate that I have been talking sincerely about the spiritual ties of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we mean anything, if we are in any way sincere when we speak about the spiritual tie between an Aboriginal and his land- it is there- we will maintain that position by allowing only traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be concerned in the administration of their traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would imagine that it would concern traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since  Dr Peterson  has played such a part in this matter and, as an anthropologist, is a man who claims to have an extensive experience and knowledge of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, I think that we should at least look at his definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Someone of Aboriginal descent who is accepted as an Aborigine by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the community in which he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of a traditional Aboriginal owner will overcome the objections which have been made, save that one that nontraditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> may find their way onto the land councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a need for non-traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on those councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He used a similar kind of language when debating the second reading speech, and here he is again using the same words, such as betrayal and defrauding of the traditional birthright of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  amendment would limit the operation of the Bill to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are traditional owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What neither honourable gentleman knows or acknowledges is that many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not traditional owners but they have a traditional interest in the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional owners form a special and very small class of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> within the clan group and who by reason of Aboriginal law and by Aboriginal custom, one might say by inheritance or by choice according to Aboriginal law or custom, are the owners of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the owners for all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who, by reason of their clan grouping, have a traditional interest of one kind or another in that land, to live on it, to use it, to pass through it or to attend ceremonies upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if the amendment of the honourable gentleman were accepted he would exclude from the protection and the benefit of this Bill all those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have traditional interests in the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are sacred to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and they consider them in quite a different category from any other category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who really knows how <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> think and behave and what they believe to be really sacrosanct will, I think, agree with my contention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that my amendment was too restrictive in that it would- I think this was what he impliedconfine the definition of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will follow absolutely meticulously, absolutely honestly and without question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enables anybody who is recognised by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in accordance with their own strict laws which they preserve quite meticulously, in a clan relationship or group relationship, to be registered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of its importance for maintaining for traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the traditional land and traditional rights which this Bill describes in its title, I ask that the amendment be seriously considered, if not here at least in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to amendments 2, 3 and 4, the Opposition is very concerned that the intentions of  His  Honour,  Mr Justice  Woodward, to include <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live in towns as being capable of having land granted to them have been circumvented by the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He recommended specifically in sub-paragraphs (v) and (vi) that Land Councils should make submissions to town planners and the Land Commissioners who, after investigation, should report to the Government on acquisition of necessary land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that in other clauses of this BUI there are many guarantees as to the negotiating rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through the land councils and the deed-holding body, the Land Trust, in respect of the mining interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would react ultimately to the very great detriment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would not even allow the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with respect to rnining interests to be protected because there would be none being renewed from which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would need to be protected or from which they could obtain payment in terms of negotiated settlements and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the minerals on these lands should belong to the Aboriginal people and, therefore, that we have to find some formula by which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can develop these lands if they wish to do so in their name, in their right and under their ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might have been all right to ride roughshod over the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in bygone times but the whole purpose of this legislation is to grant land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is moving amendments to delete a number of words which would have the effect of giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rights in this particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the understandable expectations of these companies that they would be able to continue exploration under the rules which governed them to begin with, are weighed against the equally reasonable expectation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that their wishes about reserve lands will now be respected, I have no doubt in my mind which expectation must be disappointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He used very strong words concerning the Legislative Assembly and the powers that are given to it in this Bill He has insinuated that the Assembly will control these rnining interests and the land on which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will have mineral rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the people involved took into account the real beliefs and traditions of the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to whom this Bill after all refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent Gove Land Rights case, Yirrkala <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> made the point that members of the particular mada -  which is the same as mala-  own their land because their linked mala had association which were . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The land councils were set up by Europeans and they tended not to take into consideration the feelings, beliefs and land laws of the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday at a public meeting  Dr Gavranic,  who has spent some years at Gove amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, described to us with diagrams why the whole concept of these councils and this land ownership as it is now envisaged is incorrect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our original concept with respect to the needs of these people was that there was a whole mob of blacks out in the bush- we did not determine whether they were clans or tribes- and we ‘white fellows’ or ‘balandas’, as they are known at the Top End had the task of providing something there for these <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not understand that we were mixing together <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from such tribes as the Pintubi, the Walbri, Aranda, the Iluawa and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather odd that people, some of whom have had quite a long experience with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, have expressed their concern that some of the matters in the Bill have been left to the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that they would be free of political bias, but they can see a possibility of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not getting the fair go to which they are entitled if the Legislative Assembly has these powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  Honour  Mr Justice  Woodward, when speaking of town claims, clearly indicated that the tenure of any land in towns by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be the same kind of tenure as that for all other persons and that any requests for such land should go through the normal town planning procedures of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in my initial second reading speech and subsequent statements, and with particular reference here to Alice Springs, the Government is committed to satisfying the requirements of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for land in towns such as camping areas and other areas of land for residential use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The deletion of the reference to communities is designed to bring the clause into line with other provisions to the effect that the land is held for the benefit of groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> entitled by tradition to its use and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the right to prevent exploration for them - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Yirrkala were not consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his first report the Commissioner suggested that local Aboriginal land be held on a community basis, a suggestion which was based on what the Commissioner felt to be a fairly clear consensus of Aboriginal opinion and because the Commission represented the basic political and social drift of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in modern society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the type of employment proposed to be available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in connexion with the activities which the applicant for the grant proposes to carry out upon the land; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is designed supposedly to help the traditional owners, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if there is not some time decided upon after which claims cannot be made for areas- whether they be mining areas, pastoral areas, or what ever- we will not have development such as that carried out by the Gemco company on Groote Eylandt, at Gove, or at any other place, from which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> might derive considerable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we wish the Territory to be developed and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to gain from that development, which is their right and of which we all are in favour, there should be some arrangement in this Bill which will give people investing risk capital in the Territory-most of the money invested in the Territory is risk capitalsome confidence that they will have security of their leases, whether they be pastoral, mining or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders recently reported on this matter and recommended, in particular, that this matter remain the responsibility of the Australian Par.liament and Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are unwilling to reveal the location of such sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to oversee the establishment of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs; to advise the Government upon the formation of national policies to give effect to the new obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by the 1967 referendum in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; to consult directly with Aboriginal people and organisations about their wishes and felt needs; to become the avenue of Aboriginal approaches to Government; to establish and ensure good working relationships at the official level between Commonwealth and State instrumentalities in the Aboriginal field; and as far as practicable to co-ordinate the working out of the then highly variable policies and administrative practices throughout Aboriginal Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would attribute largely to the Council’s tireless efforts to go to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to listen to their own statement of their viewpoint and wishes the present healthy fact that everywhere within Australia <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now approach Government without inhibition or hesitation, speak up for themselves in no uncertain way, and are quick to demand the full measure of their constitutional rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well set a pattern of health care delivery to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living in remote areas of Australia and also to white people living in difficult circumstances and suffering from ill health in remote areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is it envisaged that the nutritional and health problems of our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be tackled under such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(ba) The effect of mining operations, including exploration and prospecting operations, on aboriginal land or land which is claimed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not build up the greatest of goodwill or sense with respect to Aboriginal affairs if we seek continually from here to create a barrier between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and those who are exercising legitimate authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment to clause 43, subclause 2 is consequential upon the amendment which I have just mentioned so as to ensure that where additional leases are granted at Groote Eylandt, pursuant to the agreement into which the Commonwealth has entered, they will be subject to the negotiation of fair terms and conditions with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financial interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be well served by the appropriation of the 10 per cent royalty payment for their benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think I can say of the debates in this House and in the other place that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia has shown a consistent dedication to the passage of legislation to fulfil commitments made by all political parties to the granting of land rights to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But an even greater task hes ahead for the Government and for all members and that is to put the new law into practice so that it may fulfil the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the further task of putting the legislation into practice there must be the most complete consultation and participation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter of very great concern is the fact that the Government has rejected amendments which would have made.possible grants of land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the basis of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say again that this will deprive those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> described as fringe dwellers and those of mixed ancestry of the possibility of occupying or owning their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is: When it is made for or with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to consider also what we should do about providing land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> beyond providing such places as the existing Aboriginal reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to warn the Government that if these amendments are accepted it is quite possible that the position of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ideologically in relation to land could be more significant in respect of this country’s position in the world than are the rights of mining companies or miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sentimental about land never being developed and I do not think the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are so deluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have very great respect for him but I think that these amendments are unfortunate if they again represent as a result of pressures that have come from mining elements, an insensitivity to what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> feel about their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these elements are able to influence and control the Government, there will be a situation like that in Queensland and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will get nothing at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are working for their rights think it is unfortunate that these sentiments have developed in the Federal Parliament about the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They work with the State governments to try to ensure that this does not happen in States which have significant numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and potentially significant land questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is presumed therefore that people coming ashore from any ship would be allowed by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to work in peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies we received information from Paris that the journals of that French expedition, which had been cast to the four winds for reasons which I will explain in a moment, had very important references to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> stood around a pile of dried faggots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They merely indicated that the Government was proposing to give financial assistance to <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has done it similarly with the unemployed among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in that town need all the encouragement they can get and no doubt they appreciated the visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we like it or not much of the funds allocated for Aboriginal advancement is not used for that purpose; it merely makes alcoholics out of some of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that this is not always the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to continue their interest in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in my electorate and not to allow any interference to the transport and feeding policies which are doing so much for the advancement of Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the most ironical aspect of the denial of the right of a referendum vote to citizens of the Territories is that many of the descendants of the original citizens of this country, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, reside in those Territories and these people are being denied a vote in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a overwhelming yes vote, I think, of 90 per cent on the queston of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs assured me that he would be following this matter up because he regarded it as of considerable importance, not only to the operations of the Commission but also to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on whose behalf the property was to be purchased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that a conscientious member would find that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as individuals or families also present a greater work load than Australians of European ancestry or birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In electoral justice, one has to discard all such considerations of population movement, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead, each <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> received an average of $96. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One result of the formation of the co-operative for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was the establishment of Tranby Co-operative College at Glebe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like most emergent races throughout the world the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, with few exceptions, have found themselves admirably suited to participation in an enterprise which is structured along co-operative lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a very time consuming activity to belong to the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory, particularly because members of the House of Representatives who are involved also have responsibilities in regard to inquiries concerning Aboriginal health and alcoholism among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland are now regarded as lapsed from the register, to use the terms of the directive, as a result of this change of policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves now fully realise how hollow that promise was because we have seen cutbacks in special works projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen cutbacks in finance made available to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my own electorate of Grey which has a large Aboriginal population the number of homes which were to have been provided for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> this year has been halved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Port Augusta where I live, an area in which a lot of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> require homes, there was a scheme to provide 53 homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, the Labor Government introduced its legislation but because of what happened in December 1975 the legislation did not come before the Parliament for a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some will recall that in the 1968 referendum, which virtually concerned the Territory in that the referendum was in regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, those most concerned were denied a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wishes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and territorians in respect of land councils and advisers have been ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a complete lack of understanding of the Territory situation and of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, their claims and their background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is that in years gone by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have not had a real affinity with the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure no one would deny the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rights to fish off Maningrida, Croker Island, Goulburn Island or Elcho Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was the campaign director for the referendum on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a foundation member of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal advancement, as distinct from the administration of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is a virgin field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are large communities judged by Australian outback standards in Arnhem Land which consist almost entirely of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That which results from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not know their own rights or having the power to apply them, so that in the courts of the North many more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are arrested and charged with drunkenness and appear before the courts without adequate legal representatives, say, than is the case with the white community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For long enough there nave been definitions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in order to bring people under the restrictive provisions of the various acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The number of families of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia is unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be an immediate attack upon the housing of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, upon pastoral properties, and there should be immediate pressure brought to bear upon housing commissions throughout the country to make houses readily available in the metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that it is hardly relevant to talk of tertiary education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory just under 50 per cent of the people in the 500 000 square miles are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government Departments will have to be more adventurous in appointing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to executive positions and in appointing <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to managerial positions on reserves, ensuring Aboriginal families do have the opportunity to live in houses in the same standard of living as the rest of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be arrogant and mistaken to devise policies for women in the way that special policies are needed, say for migrants or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or pensioners or other deprived minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, he overlooked the fact that the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill, which was initiated by the Labor Government when it was in office, gives rise to a potential claim for that area by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That industry also would give a tremendous fillip to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area in that they could work in such a tremendous commercial setup which would have the effect of rehabilitating the port of Darwin and the city of Darwin, as well as the whole economy of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In actual fact, it was a very important referendum for Territorians because it concerned the Constitutional change which gave the Commonwealth Government the right to make laws for all races in Australia, which of course, included <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he noted that Professor Fred Hollows, the leader of the national trachoma and eye health program, whose work has been mentioned during previous question times by the Minister for Health, whose birthday we celebrate today, reported to the Annual Scientific Congress sponsored this week by the Australian College of Ophthalmologists that trachoma had declined dramatically among the 1800 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Moree in the last 10 years since they began to get houses with hot and cold running water? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A previous recommendation of the Committee was that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be involved to as great an extent as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This comprehensive management must involve the local population, particularly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whose traditions and association with this region contribute to its cultural quality and its unique features. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of the House I wish to relate an incident which commenced on 9 February this year when I claimed in Brisbane that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had formed a cooperative to steal pension and social security cheques from letterboxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed that because I had said that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had formed a co-operative or a group I had insulted an entire race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was not saying for a moment that the increase in the number of cheques stolen from 6912 cheques to 10 450 cheques, could be attributed to the actions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; far from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This  Senator Colston  of the Australian Labor Party from the other House continued to whip up political feelings in Queensland under the guise of being concerned that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been gravely insulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They happen to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In entering a debate on Australia’s immigration policies and population it strikes me as rather odd that the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  who preceded me in this debate, spent all his time talking about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to regard <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as immigrants we really are going to have an absurd debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February I made public a minute from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations showing that the Government had instructed CES managers in Queensland to take unemployment benefits away from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on church missions and government settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, reports which the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs of the former Labor Government made, tabled on 30 October 1975, and reports which the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders made on the question of Aboriginal employment, tabled on 26 August 1976, have not yet been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not being uncharitable in this, but I ask: How much of that money went to the Aboriginal children and to the schools for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most distressing things I saw was that, whilst there were beautiful buildings like the Kormilda College where the ratio of teachers to pupils was excellent in every way, there was a lack of facilities in the outback area and at the stations where the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were really being taught. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For expenditure on allowances and other expenses for the purpose of employment training and re-training (including the training and re-training of widow and repatriation pensioners, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, and ex-members of the Defence Force) to meet the needs of the labour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall enumerate them again: Widows- and the Government is very good at bashing widows and the widows mite; it has a reputation for that not only in Australia but around the world- repatriation pensioners, migrants, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and exmembers of the Defence force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, another matter concerns a private members’ Bill in the Senate which deals with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and which gives a very good definition of them in the legal sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are special provisions for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expedition has made comments from time to time about deafness and other ill health among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It probably has been one of the best organised health programs in the remote areas of Australia and certainly will be responsible for overcoming a lot of the illnesses that presently are afflicting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and some white people in the remote areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he was informed on 1 1 March last that an estimated 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Maningrida in the Northern Territory had contracted syphilis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he also assure the House that the national trachoma and eye health program sponsored by the Australian College of Ophthalmologists will not be obstructed by the Queensland Government in attempting to reduce the very high incidence of eye diseases amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It effectively took unemployment benefits away from unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were living on church missions and Government settlements and who were not prepared to leave their traditional homes to find employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>14) Which (a) Ministers and (b) departments have considered (i) that report and (ii) Chapter 9  Employment  of the report of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders (Senate  Hansard,  26 August 1976, page 355). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stung by the public’s outrage at this breach of election promises to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Government resorted to a diversionary tactic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answering to pre-arranged questions in the House, the Prime Minister twice took the cheap and nasty course of trying to blame the Australian Labor Party Government for an increase in the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In November 1972 about 3700 were unemployed; in December 1973 there were 9900 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unemployed as a direct result of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, after his first answer on 26 August last year, tabled statistics which showed the number of unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the end of July last year as 9667. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister now states that at the end of February this year there were 12 218 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliamentary Library Statistics Group has prepared a table which shows that at the end of March there were 12 293 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the work test which determines eligibility for unemployment benefits was modified so that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on missions and reserves did not have to move to stations and towns in order to make themselves available for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An increase in the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> registered as unemployed- not the number of unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- was thus inevitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Labor had not come to power in 1972, it is possible that the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> registered as unemployed would still be under 4000 while untold thousands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would have continued to be denied assistance in gaining employment and income security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovative employment programs, including special works projects, specific grants to Aboriginal communities for enterprises, housing and town management, and the Regional Employment Development and National Employment and Training schemes were introduced to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to tackle the unemployment problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately for the thousands of unemployed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Minister’s statement will have little effect on the problem of Aboriginal unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides little hope that the Government intends to reduce the growing number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been thrown out of work by this Government ‘s economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reports recommended major amendments to the procedures governing the payment of unemployment benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the extension of the very successful vocational officer service, further development of Aboriginal employment schemes, and the implementation of anti-discrimination legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August last year a Senate Select Committee reported on the environmental conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and presented detailed comment and recommendations to alleviate the problem of Aboriginal unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of extending the vocational officer service of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Government applied severe staff and travel restrictions which effectively denied many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> income, support and assistance in obtaining employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He brings to the attention of the House a very notable event, that is, the tenth anniversary of the 1967 referendum which gave to the Commonwealth, through an amendment to the Constitution, the power to make special laws with regard to Aboriginal citizens of Australia and also to treat <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as full citizens by including them in the census. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think perhaps the greatest achievement is the fact that today more and more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- both men and womenare standing up and speaking for their own people, not simply in national forums but in their local communities and areas of activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not only the Labor Government but also the Labor zealots going back to the mid-1950s who encouraged the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders to gather together with people like Faith Bandler and Joe McGinnis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was soon after the appointment of  Mr Bryant  as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs- a ministry with an exclusive prerogative and which was a significant development, as the Minister readily acknowledges- he invited 80 representatives of the Aboriginal people to come to Canberra under the chairmanship of  Mr Joe  McGinnis who had been the leader of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Administrative Services has supplied me with the following information in answer to the honourable gentleman’s question: Since January 1977, Commonwealth Police in Brisbane have been investigating information received by them that a group of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been committing crimes by stealing Government cheques from letter boxes and forging and uttering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Fox report deals not with the general problem of export but with the specific problems of the Northern Territory and has drawn attention to very serious and difficult problems concerning environmental control, respect of the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other factors which we have to consider in the second Fox report in respect of our mining and milling concern the environment, national parks and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the planned uranium mining area in the Alligator River zone there are about 1000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate strategies strongly recommended by the Commission are the immediate creation of the Kakadu National Park in the same region which would protect for all time lands that are of great traditional significance to the Aborigine, and the direct involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in the demarcation and subsequent management of the Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our tour of Western Australia and of this East Alligator River area we did not see any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> when we got to the main towns but in these mining areas we did not see any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the do-gooders and perhaps Friends of the Earth are inciting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to go out into the mining areas, camp there and suggest that the areas are sacred Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Grassby is reported in the Brisbane Telegraph of 20 April 1977 as claiming that generations of Japanese had been led to believe that “Australians were racists”, and that they, the Japanese, had “been brought up on textbooks critical of the White Australia policy and our treatment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>.” <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When did the Queensland Minister for Lands inform him that the Queensland Government does not view favourably the acquisition of lands for development by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or by Aboriginal groups in isolation  (Hansard,  7 December 1976, p. 3370; Queensland  Hansard  8 December 1976, p. 2208). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it should be remembered equally in Australia that those conditions are not as bad as some of the conditions under which our own <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect the Committee noted that at present fishing and other seafood gathering by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> was not adversely affected by nonAborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee noted that because of the isolation of the area few non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would enter the seas adjoining Aboriginal land anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the legitimate interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be protected if their traditional fishing rights are preserved and their right to the privacy of their land is clearly  recognised by the establishment of a buffer zone of sea which cannot legally be entered by commercial fishermen or holiday makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of criticism of the legislation introduced by the people who live in the Northern Territory, but the people who introduced the original legislation and those who now criticise do not live in the Territory and do not know what is involved in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans living side by side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that if the 2 kilometres off-shore had been handed over, not necessarily to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but to the people who advise them and speak for them to a great extent, those people would have seen to it that there was division amongst the whites and blacks who live in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the right to use that water anyhow but if they want it closed to someone they have to apply to the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a provision would undermine the very good relations which have been built up over the years between the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Europeans who live in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the legitimate interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be protected- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Land Council was set up by the previous Government to advise Woodward on how to distribute land among the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but the Central Land Council soil has not got away from being completely dominated by its white advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether it would have been the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token we can see that people in the land councils could be acting in a manner which will get <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> off side with the other people who live in the country and lead to a completely unfair approach being taken to the seas around the coast of Austrafia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, 40 per cent of land and 80 per cent of the Northern Territory coastline could be under the control of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if the decision were taken to have a 2 kilometre sea zone and to make any interested party other than the Aboriginal people apply for permission to use those waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Committee’s report is very sound in that it gives <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the right to use any part of the sea and the right to apply for use of any specific part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want to live alongside the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to develop the country together with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, it took no account of the impact of economic decisions on the lives and well-being of human beings- the thousands of young people whose prospects in life have been blasted on the very threshold of their working lives, the migrants who came here for better opportunites and whose opportunities are being destroyed, the small businessmen being forced to close down, the families being deprived of a second or even first earned income, the people paying off a home mortgage or wanting to buy their own home, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> whose hopes for a decent place in their own country have yet again been deferred and denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the safeguards to the environment are contemptible; the respect for the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is beneath contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger mine will come right to the base of Mount Brockman which is the most important sacred site of the Arnhem Land <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is accepted that the mining and milling of uranium, particularly given the location of the main known deposits, pose major issues to be resolved in relation to the physical environment and in relation to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the areas concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development of these deposits therefore must be handled with extreme care and sensitivity, not only in relation to the physical environment but, more importantly, in relation to the social and cultural wellbeing of the up to 800 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will reduce the Territory’s financial dependence on the rest of Australia and will provide significant direct and indirect employment opportunities for the people of the Territory, including the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What consideration did he give then to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than to impose on them the most divisive piece of legislation ever inflicted on people in the Northern Territory, either black or white? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite need not try to tell me that the establishment of a township in the Jabiru area will do any more harm to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who live on the Arnhem Land escarpment or the Arnhem Land plateau than the alcohol which was introduced to them some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Uranium mining in the Northern Territory, commonly referred to as the Top End of Australia, will destroy the physical environment on which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> depend for the survival of their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I quote from the Liberal and National Country Parties Aboriginal Affairs Policy of November 1975:  the life style of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will, of necessity, vary between those living in a more tribalised state on or near their traditional lands and those living in or near towns and cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I would like to see this Government not rush headlong into it in the way in which the Labor Government, and also the LiberalNational Country Party Government when it came to power, did with the Aboriginal land rights legislation without getting to the grass roots and taking notice of the opinions of those people whom that legislation is supposed to benefit, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the spinifex and in the bough shade miles away in the sticks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s response to the problem has been to slash expenditure, to throw at least 4,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> out of work, and then to offer employment opportunities to approximately 500 Aboriginal men and women through its inadequate community development employment program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has above all failed to pursue the interests of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in a matter they consider to be basic to their self respect, to the preservation of their cultural heritage, to their ability to cope with our society and its pressurestheir land claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an answer on 2 June 1977 to a question on notice from me he stated that the Queensland Minister for Lands had written to him on 10 December 1976 informing him that the Queensland Government does not view favourably the acquisition of land for development by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or by Aboriginal groups in isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the rate of inflation has increased by 25 per cent in two years, assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is going in the opposite direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had to wait long enough for this $100m which was provided in the 1975-76 Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must remember that following the 1967 referendum which decided that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be counted in a census it was considered by most Australians that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would take their place on an equal basis with the rest of the community in the social structure of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have mentioned, in the 1975-76 Budget we provided $ 100m for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was it that so soon after the recognition of the Aboriginal population, after we agreed that we would count <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as one of us, we have seen this downward adjustment in their living standards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why the barren land has been taken from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the rip-off that the State and Federal governments are getting out of the development of all the mining ventures in this country for which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are suffering? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that would warrant the Government spending more money on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps there would be some justification for this policy of cutting back funds for the Aboriginal population if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to be brought up to somewhere near an equal basis with the rest of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out already that unemployment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> increased this year by 45 per cent and now embraces nearly 50 per cent of the Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, about 2 per cent of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are educated above the level of half way through secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why make the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> carry such a cruel, unfair penalty just because the Government refuses to take guidance on how the country should be run? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were not to assimilate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into the white community; we were to integrate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  noted in his speech a little earlier, only recently the last known traditional tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were brought from the desert into a community which has come under the influence of Western ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We took first of all the advisory committee that the previous Minister had established, then prominent Aboriginal people such as the late Harold Blair, Pastor  Sir Douglas  Nicholls and so on, members of the Federal Council for the Advancement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, and other people who represented their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be an even worse representative of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than was the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the honourable member’s request that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  should speak directly to the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard much about grants-in-aid and money for housing, health, education, employment, welfare and so on for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this Government is taking very seriously indeed the matter of aid, help and assistance in every direction to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national employment strategy of this Government is to raise effective levels of employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program is in keeping with the Government’s national employment strategy to raise the level of employment among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard the Minister say that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is far more soul destroying to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be paid to sit down and not work than it is to pay social security benefits to white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the payment of what is called ‘sit-down money’ is not in their best interests and they know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we inflict these unwanted organisations and people upon the real <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall expenditure on programs of direct assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in 1977-78 is estimated to be about $ 176m compared with $ 1 6 1 m in 1 976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under a Liberal-Country Party Government <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will be better not worse off Urge <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to vote LiberalCountry Party on December 13. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August 1973, the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> registered as unemployed was 3,053; in August 1974, the number was 5,080. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August 1977- these are the latest figures available- the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> registered as unemployed was 12,224. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague has already mentioned a matter that concerns me greatly and that is the large increase in the number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of money allocated to the number of special works projects which provide employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various country areas, of course, has been cut drastically with the result that town councils, district councils and so on that were able to make use of these special works projects now find these doors closed to them and the direct result is that large increase in Aboriginal unemployment which my colleague mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement which he issued some months ago on the employment of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said in an address to the National Press Club on 7 July of this year, which was very close to National <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Day: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when this Government came to office and was given the responsibility of funding special assistance for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, one of the first things that we were concerned to do was to get control of the administrative base upon which programs were implemented because we were convinced that we would get real value only if we had well planned, well thought-out and soundly administered programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrants are the most savagely affected group, apart from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in Australia and are particularly affected by this unemployment crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to deal with the drinking problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that some positive steps have not been taken already to create proper drinking facilities for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory, particularly on a non-profit basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr)  no credit to try to make a joke out of a very serious problem that affects <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article which was headed ‘<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> die in parks ‘states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article goes on to talk about the reckless drinking by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  who is to be the next  speaker  in this debate, to inform the chamber and me in particular- he would know more about this than I would- about what a great success the purchase of the hotel at Finke outside Alice Springs to cater for civilised drinking by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has brought up the problem of drinking by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say here and now that some of the worst offenders in supplying alcohol to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These services have been requested by the Aboriginal people themselves to try to overcome the alcohol problem amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government also is supporting the purchase of the Daly River licence to assist in overcoming the alcohol problem amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Daly River, Pepimanarti and Port Keats area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we were associated not only with the grog problem of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also with the implementation of further constitutional development for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Acting Speaker, education has joined the long list of broken promises by the Fraser Government, but unlike the broken pledges about employment, Medibank, hospitals, wage indexation, growth centres, water projects, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, legal aid, migrant welfare, urban transport, which were given under the pressures of the last election campaign, education has suffered a double breach of undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Is the Minister for Health aware of the growing incidence of glue sniffing among young people m the country, m particular among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the inner suburban areas of the major cities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will maintain present levels of assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cabinet has decided to oppose the land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Borroloola in the Northern Territory without consulting the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further educational disadvantage is suffered by many other children, such as country students, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, migrants and girls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the report of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, the school system has failed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> very badly by its inappropriateness and inadequacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Prime Minister who said: ‘A Liberal National Country Party Government will initiate a new deal for migrants ‘; who said: ‘We will maintain present levels of assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’; who said: ‘We shall ensure no person is denied legal aid because of lack of means’; and who said: ‘Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be a return to business confidence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia were encouraged to enrol, as distinct from being deterred from enrolling, it would have an enrolment in excess of the 10 per cent margin- in fact, in excess of the 20 per cent margin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western Australian redistribution enshrines the most serious and deliberate discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the new electorate of Kalgoorlie is larger in size and larger in population than it need be if all eligible Abongines were enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discrimination against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has diluted the vote of all other Australians in the Kalgoorlie electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the Federal Government is failing in its obligation to encourage <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enrol and exercise their democratic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Liberal Party has engaged in a deliberate campaign to discourage and deter <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from enrolling and from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of discrimination against and intimidation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has been fully disclosed in the Court of Disputed Returns over the last few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is not done I would anticipate that by the next election there could be in the order of 3,000 to 4,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on the roll and under such circumstances the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence was given that 34 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been deprived of their right to vote at that polling booth alone by this ‘trick’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were asked these questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the five Liberal lawyers,  Mr Haydn  Wesley Dixon, told the judge that he had decided that ‘any lawful means could be used to stop illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from voting’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that ‘he had regarded illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as being invalid potential voters because of the pressure he was told was being applied to them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would enable the wholesale disfranchisement not only of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also of migrants and indeed scores of thousands of handicapped Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not all forms of discrimination are so blatant as that practised against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question we can legitimately ask now is: If in Kalgoorlie, the largest electorate in the world, the electorate in Western Australia which already has the largest population but the smallest enrolment, we find that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have exercised their option to enrol are being deterred from voting might we not assume that they have also been deterred from enrolling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why this electorate is being made still largerbecause Liberal lawyers and other Liberals have deterred <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from exercising their right to vote as Australian electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is certainly not the view of this Committee based on the evidence it received, or of the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders in its report ‘The Environmental Conditions of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders and the Preservation of their Sacred Sites’, and the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare in its recent report ‘Drug Problems in Australia- An Intoxicated Society?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We called it the Special Broadcasting Service because it may well prove desirable for the Government, in the years ahead, if there is a request, to provide some special broadcasting service for example, to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia or to the social welfare area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are very critical of the situation, particularly that pertaining to Kalgoorlie where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, for example, are not deemed to be part of the population because they cannot be put on the electoral roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  it must impress you to know that there are at least 22,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia, a large concentration of them being in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two hundred years ago- six or seven generations backbefore Australia was taken from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, our ancestors lived in a ‘pre-industrial society ‘ in which 90 per cent of the work force were involved in agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth is that recent arrivals in this country- that is, those who have been here for up to 15 years- are very much worse off in terms of employment possibilities than any group in Australia other than the only true Australians, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, whose employment situation is an utter disgrace to all of the nonAboriginal invaders and colonisers of this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Will the Government take steps to take over Aurukun and Mornington Island Missions before the Queensland Government does so on the pretext of improving services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The emphasis is to the effect that safeguards are effective, that the problems of disposal have been solved, that the environment is safeguarded and that the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The thrust of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is now being felt and it is now becoming apparent that it cuts across the understanding of the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> about their land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not comprehend and do not accept large land councils such as the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now are demanding separate land councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he criticised the Minister for sacking from Maningrida the people who were working for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is very strange that in only two instances the honourable member represented entirely the wrong stories about people who were working for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should realise that there are people who are sincere about doing things for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and seeing that they are done right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are speaking for the Uniting Church in Australia are convinced, the people who represent the Queensland Council- it is not recognised by the State Government- are convinced, the Australian Labor Party supporters are convinced and I believe that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is sitting at the table, is convinced in his heart that this takeover is a move by the Queensland Government to ensure that it has maximum control over the spokesmen for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that it can push forward to fulfilment its agreements with the mining interests which want to mine bauxite on part of the Aboriginal reserve at Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise the fundamental right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to retain their racial identity and traditional lifestyle or, where desired, to adopt partially or wholly a European lifestyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference I made about the recognition of the fundamental rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to retain their racial identity and traditional lifestyle also affects another situation at Aurukun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Queensland is the only State not to have handed over its responsibilities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the Federal Government in terms of the 1967 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister was unwise to use the expression he used when talking about how other State governments have been co-operative in entering into agreements whereby the Commonwealth Government could administer the problems related to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us remind the Minister, who is a quite capable Minister and one whom we consider understands the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, that it is no good quoting letters written by  Mr Porter  or resolutions passed by the people concerned if the Government limits its actions to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act of 1971 clearly defines that a reserve is ‘land reserved and set apart for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with land reserved and set apart for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not for the multi-national mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the terms of that Act a reserve refers to any land that is for the time being reserved for the purpose of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act 1971 of <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, under the power that has been exercised already, rights are vested in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable gentlemen would be aware, the Commonwealth is concerned that there should have been adequate consultation with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Aurukun community concerning the proposal and the arrangements between the Queensland Government and the consortium in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and were for all practical purposes destitute, without shelter and without future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have seen <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves leaving the house to ring the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> own the properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will this decision be reviewed in accordance with Government policy as expressed in the GovernorGeneral’s speech of 2 1 February 1978 which stated that emphasis will be given to assisting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become more self-sufficient and acquire the skills to manage their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-57-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration was given and is being given to a way in which the two factors could be brought together so as to maintain the Government’s commitment to purchases for Aboriginals through the Land Fund Commission and the Government’s commitment in its policy statement to recognising the past dispossession and dispersal of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the establishment of such a capital account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is much more pertinent to note that over the last two or three months the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I have had a number of discussions about various aspects of Commonwealth policies in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with a view to getting greater expedition into the pursuit of those policies in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member is the  chairman  of an all-party parliamentary committee and he moves around Australia saying that he is concerned about the plight and the problems of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland legislation- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the regulations and by-laws made under themprovide that officials, as well as Aboriginal and Island councils, manage the affairs of reserve communities and the officials have the overriding power and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in his second reading speech, and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  when addressing the inaugural National Aboriginal Conference, have said that the Liberal Party and the Government want <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders to be as free as other Australians to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want time to see whether we cannot persuade the Government at least to listen to the many voices of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> over the years which have asked for acquisition of reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am afraid that the Aboriginal lands trust legislation enacted in Western Australia represented a pretty hollow victory for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having the power that I referred to earlier to restrict entry to their land, the Western Australian Government is having second thoughts and is looking at the possibility of taking that right away from the Aboriginal communities so that various mining interests will be allowed onto Aboriginal land at the behest of the State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Opposition members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs were in favour of going to Aurukun in the course of the Committee’s normal investigations of the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and at the same time to get our views on the facts as they occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been swamped with visitors from the media and the Parliament over the last few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many actions are taken in the name of the Queensland Government on State reserves ostensibly for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders which, nevertheless, they do not see as being for their benefit at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the record must demonstrate to the Minister that when <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ask for this right and when it is granted to them they exercise it with great responsibility and effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 we gave <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rights over their properties, we ended wage discrimination, we established their rights to have legal representation in courts and we ended the odious permanent entry system onto reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation seeks to give to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the right of self-determination- an ability of the people themselves to be able to make decisions in their own communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In relation to the programs that the Commonwealth has a responsibility to provide, it is important that the Commonwealth acts responsibly for all Aboriginal people, not just some <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this debate has proceeded over the past few weeks, I have become increasingly concerned that the welfare of the people who are caught up in the middle of the wrangle that is going on between the Commonwealth and the State- that is, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- is in some danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australia have come a long way in the past 30-odd years, from the days when I knew some of them and went to school with them, when they lived on the fringe of Cooktown in shanties and communities that were known as ‘blacks camps’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eleven years ago, in 1967, the people of the Commonwealth of Australia by an overwhelming majority voted in favour of amending the Constitution so that the Commonwealth could provide for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed I do not doubt their loyalty because over a period a great deal of guidance has been given to them and a great deal of money has been spent in their community, but one could hardly compare Cherbourg, a Europeanised community five kilometres from the sizable township of Murgon, nestling amongst a number of communities with some farmers and graziers- a community in which I found it impossible to distinguish any full-blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- with Aurukun and Mornington Island with 80 per cent or more of their populations being full-blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view the Uniting Church in Australia and its predecessor, the Presbyterian church, have done an extremely good job with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That simply means that the companies and the Government will talk to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but will not listen or, if they listen, will not take any notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill is capable of conceding certain rights and prerogatives to communities established under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act of 1 97 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to ‘empower’ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, who live on reserves in Queensland, to manage and control their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially in proposed clause 5, in which there are four subclauses, each of which the Opposition seeks to amend, the proposal is that where a council for an Aboriginal reserve or an Islander reserve requests the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make a declaration or even where the Minister is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adult Islanders or <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want the Commonwealth to take action, the Minister may take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>there is not in force under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act or Torres Strait Islanders Act in respect of a person a permit authorizing the person to reside on, or visit, a Reserve to which this Act applies, being a person who is not otherwise entitled to reside on, or visit, the Reserve; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A person in respect of whom there is in force an authority under sub-section ( 1 ) to reside on, or visit, a Reserve shall not be prevented from entering and residing on, or visiting, as the case may be, and shall not be ejected from, the Reserve by reason that a permit authorizing him to reside on, or visit, the Reserve is not in force in respect of him under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act or the Torres Strait Islanders Act, and it shall not, for that reason, be unlawful for the person to be on the Reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person in respect of whom there is in force an authority under sub-section (3) to reside on, or visit, a pan of a Reserve shall not be prevented from entering and residing on, or visiting, as the case may be, and shall not be ejected from, that part of the Reserve, by reason that a permit authorizing him to reside on, or visit, the Reserve is not in force in respect of him under the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Act or the Torres Strait Islanders Act, and it shall not, for that reason, be unlawful for the person to be on that part of the Reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  attitude on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree that all the services that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  has suggested <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should provide for themselves should be arranged by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what will happen if they seek to provide these services in a way in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not approve and the Minister does not approve? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply that the Federal Government as well as, of course, the Aboriginal community should be happy that what is being done is what is required to be done in the fashion in which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want it to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the whole argument is about whether <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should have the right to decide for themselves, not that they have to do it all themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s amendment to clause 9 (2) does not take anything away from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will allow the Federal Government to be sure that what the Queensland Government is doing is acceptable to the Federal Government and presumably to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are entitled to know by virtue of a positive action taken by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely what the Government is saying is that if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to be allowed to control their reserves in their own way anyone who enters those reserves should be expected to abide by the by-laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 12 as it is framed is a long, involved attempt to get around the capacity of the Queensland Government to prohibit people, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or Islanders, from going onto reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s amendment is a simpler statement, The reason for wording it in that way is that the clause as it is framed at the moment does not provide for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the Islanders to control non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and nonIslanders, hence the Opposition’s proposed new clause 12(1), which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the way in which the clause is framed at the moment the only power the legislation gives to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is the power to allow onto reserves <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who have been prohibited from entering reserves by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to add a power which the legislation has not given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not allowed them any right to control non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I suggest that the legislation should allow the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders the right to admit <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Islanders and the right to admit or exclude nonAborigines or Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What procedures are adopted in the Northern Territory and in each State to advise <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of their right to enrol as electors and to assist them to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-72">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The management plan prepared by the Director and approved by Parliament will ensure environmental protection, and that appropriate management practices are employed, taking into account the interests of the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal Act provides for the closing of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund which was established under section 21 of the Northern Territory Administration Act and for it to be replaced by an Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account to be established under section 63 of the Land Rights Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of this report, entitled ‘Emergency Accommodation in Perth and its Availability to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’, the Western Australian Advisory Committee on Homeless Persons, which includes two members directly involved with Aboriginal needs, is investigating the problems of homeless <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time we believe that the interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> can be best preserved through cooperation rather than by an act of acquisition which could, of itself - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The powers that were spelt out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act, which was passed last week ostensibly for the purpose of overcoming the intrusion of the State into the legitimate rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to determine their own rate of acculturation into the western culture, are identical to those spelt out in the 1976 Act which deals with Aboriginal councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The nine days from 3 to 11 April will forever be remembered by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia with despair and total disappointment as nine days in which they were again abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The least important people in the whole dismal exercise were the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now find that they are firmly back in the grasp of the State Government, imprisoned by the Government from which they were trying to escape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a totally unsatisfactory aspect of this agreement and it will be seen by all Australians as yet another defeat for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would put on a completely new footing the relationship between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the rest of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives no security to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see some disadvantages in having centralised control of certain matters concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but the fact remains that the prime responsibility for Aboriginal affairs rests squarely with the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory, provision is made for entry permits to be granted by the local people, the traditional owners of the land, for persons other than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as well as for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So does anyone wonder that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Federal Opposition are uneasy about these amendments to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in selfmanagement by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not by the Mareeba Shire Council asking the State Government to take over, to set the rents and to evict people at its behest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly seemed to think that it was quite all right for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to have inalienable tenure of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is the way to go about giving <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> self-management and what was in the minds of the Australian people when they voted in the referendum in 1 967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that 10 Aboriginals, say, in Redfern in Sydney, in one of the areas of land that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> occupy, could apply to form a council in the area of the South Sydney Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can imagine what sort of a system there might be in the middle of Sydney if a group of 10 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> took it upon themselves to provide those services and to opt out of any other regulation which may apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are waiting for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  second reading speech might be summed up by saying that it claims that the legislation is designed implement land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to tidy up a few machinery matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It protects the power of corporate secrecy and makes <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> impotent to challenge a company if it considers that disclosing its technical information might tend to incriminate it in regard to the protection of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This trend is not so dangerous in this Bill that all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will rise up in indignation as they certainly did, for example, concerning the recent shameful legislation introduced by the Queensland Government concerning Aurukun and Mornington Island which firmly denies land ownership and mineral and quarrying rights to Aboriginal shires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are to be tolerated and trusted to a very limited extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has moved with reasonable and commendable promptness on this, as it did in relation to the original Land Rights Act, to see that land rights are given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the important provisions which will enable the creation of original trusts to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to hold the title to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 19 October 1961 the House of Representatives ordered the printing of a report of its then select committee inquiring into the voting rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important conclusion reached was that tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would soon become integrated into one Australian society and that the Government should assist this to occur smoothly by providing more access to free post-primary education, including a knowledge of political and civic functions and structures, social integration of schooling and employment, and decent housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been disturbing developments, particularly in the States of Western Australia and Queensland, which indicate the urgency of the need to assist <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to integrate as full citizens with respect to voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 1961 report estimated that there were 26,000 full blood and 4,000 predominantly Aboriginal-blood <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> disenfranchised, except for those who were serving in or who had served in the armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland at that time had the most backward provisions for voting by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which I will outline briefly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Queensland had no franchise for persons of half or more Aboriginal blood although half castes not living with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> could, if they applied, get exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It did not extend even to those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had been exempted from the highly paternal Aboriginal Preservation and Protection Act, popularly known then by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as the Dog Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The franchise had been there since 1926, but only 487 of the 1,042 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were on stations were enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, in the State of New South Wales less than half of those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were enrolled, because the enrolment requirement for them was not enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meant that something like 1 7,000 Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had been declared, by reason of their manner of living, personal associations, standard of social habits and behaviour or inability to manage their own affairs unaided, in need of special care or assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 89 out of roughly 17,000 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had not been declared wards or had been removed from the register of wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommended voluntary enrolment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wanted specially qualified electoral officers to be provided- this has never been followed up; no government has done this- to receive enrolment applications at places accessible to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and help to be provided to them to enrol upon expression of a wish to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommended penalties for duress or undue influence on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the exercise of their franchise and an explanation of voting and Parliament, using well prepared visual aids and publications, to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at settlements and other centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have by and large provided for voluntary enrolment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who, when enrolled, are subject to the same compulsory voting as the rest of us, but outstandingly we have not provided for official means to facilitate enrolment and voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Western Australia had done so we would not have had the disgraceful spectacle last year of a Western Australian Minister being found by a court of disputed returns to have been responsible for putting pressure on illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> not to enrol or not to vote, his expressed justification being that many of them had been brainwashed by his Australian Labor Party opponents while he personally found it distasteful to campaign among illiterates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal field workers were persuading <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, whose languages they understood in many cases, to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee was set up after I placed this matter on the Notice Paper, But in whatever way it is done, I think that the matter should come to a vote and that a decision should be arrived at today so that we can demonstrate our concern to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to become full citizens and eventually to justify compulsory enrolment as for other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have to enrol, but once they are enrolled they are supposed to vote, even though many of them do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the views of the Reverend Sheperdson, who was the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ guiding force in the Elcho Island area and across the northern coast of Australia, or at least in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that at that time he had 800-odd <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on Elcho Island- there are now 1,000- he would not pressure them to enrol because he considered that they did not fully understand what it was all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far more education should be given to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on how to vote and the reasons for voting, explaining who the people are and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to preferential voting, the mover and seconder of the motion suggested that there should be optional voting for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are confused by having optional voting in their own elections and then having a preferential system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One settlement had more inhabitants than another and one candidate got all the votes in the larger settlement whilst the man who would probably have done a far better job for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- certainly the Aboriginal community considered that he would have- was not elected because he came from a settlement that did not have the same number of inhabitants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I should say that the select committee would be just another bind for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mean, part of the purpose of the exercise, quite apart from just protecting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, is to know more about what goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A research institute is being set up specifically to look into the problems of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should it be excluded when much of what goes on may have an effect on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, taken together, they deal with the need to make an early start on the mining and development of our uranium resources, whilst at the same time ensuring adequate protection of the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region, protection of the rights and legitimate interests of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the region, protection of the safety of persons engaged in the uranium industry, and the development of adequate safeguards to prevent proliferation of the nuclear armament industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mechanism for doing this will be by the grant of a long-term lease by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some examples of this intrusion contained in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill include: Firstly, that the national park is to be proclaimed under a Federal Act; and, secondly, that negotiations for the lease from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are in the hands of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill requires consultation with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- that is fine and it is only natural- but nowhere does it recognise the existence of the proposed new Northern Territory Government, even though the national park is nominally within the boundaries of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will appreciate that we are dealing with procedures for the establishment of management policies and arrangements for the use of land to which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will hold title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have a responsibility in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but we have failed to do anything in that area as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member knows very well that it is left to the State of Queensland to look after the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the number of Aboriginal communities in these areas and having regard to their traditional fishing activities in surrounding waters, what involvement is planned for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the area in any surveillance program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we destroy the records of the ‘black drive ‘ against the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we suppress the records of shooting and poisoning of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Western Australia in the nineteenth century? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to see any weak-kneed approach to the position as to what are alleged to be Queensland’s rights because we are concerned about what has happened already in Queensland in two areas- <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the kids in my electorate of Melbourne, <span class="highlight">aborigines</span>, women who would like to enter the workforce and disadvantaged groups could become as job motivated as the Government likes but there still will not be jobs available for them unless we have a concerted manpower policy which creates jobs and which runs parallel with the schemes which are envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971 all persons employed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island reserves are paid a training allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are pensioners and hold pensioner health benefit cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the adversaries at law of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protected from the public gaze and the Press will probably do nothing about this but respectfully doff its cap and lower its eyes as befits a loyal serf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister will be aware that the pastoral land is the choicest part of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ claim to both the pastoral lease and the unalienated land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is central to their traditional land, and to that of other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is used by one of the widest networks of traditionally associated <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mount Isa Mines, and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, even earlier, both indicated their interest to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a coastal region which separates the islands, considered by the Commissioner, and which the Minister now accepts as being, land to which Aboriginals are entitled, from the Borroloola town common, which is the other part of the land acceded to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by the Minister’s statement and by the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bing Bong area is the land used most intensively by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister would concede, if he reads the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ case, that without Bing Bong they have less than half a loaf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Yanyula and Mara <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> living at Borroloola, Ngukurr and Numbulwar have been interested in acquiring Bing Bong station since at least 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John Avery, who has been living in this area with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for some years- he is an anthropology student- believes people have died as a result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it is the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ choice for a settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These uses have been keenly advanced by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously these problems are not going to get any less while the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> feel constrained to stay in the Borroloola town area, subsisting all too often on store food, with no access to their traditional nutritious food and active way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Living in the town, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> feel there are unwarranted intrusions in that Europeans have interrupted ceremonies, entered their camps at night and even their dwellings, and molested women at times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tourists in the area have a subtle and unpleasant effect on the lives of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> which surely could be better controlled if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> felt that they were masters of their own destiny and of tourist entry to the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The acquisition of Bing Bong for local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would have farreaching and beneficial significance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in western Queensland, the Barkly Tablelands and an area to the east, including southeast Arnhem Land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not subject to the surveillance of the station caretaker and are some of the few sites the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> feel safe to occupy while there is a caretaker on the pastoral lease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John Avery has called it, the position of women in the community would deteriorate, and the assimilation of local <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to the position of wage labourers would be advanced at the cost of a breakdown of community life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relocation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Bing Bong would allow a more even, flexible and ecologically sound use of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Minister argued in reply to a question yesterday from the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and in reply to another question today is that the doctors will render accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same applies for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and many migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer to the Aurukun and Mornington Island problem in which we are anxious to promote the cause of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one concerned for the environment, concerned for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and concerned for the relevant government instrumentalities I indict the Minister as being ministerially responsible at least for the most inadequate legislation that has come into this Parliament for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Territorians, should have the right to administer and control those lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole essence of the Government’s claims was that it would provide strong, tough codes of practice so that Australians- people who were working in  the mining industry, people who were living near mining operations, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and people who were in any way affected by the transportation of yellowcake- would be carefully covered so that both their health, and the environment, would not be impaired in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We rarely see <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with skin cancer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme was originally set up with these high sounding ideals: ( 1 ) preserving the natural resource; (2) providing useful employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; and (3) conserving the soil, water and wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that one-third of the Territory’s population is Aboriginal in itself places an enormous burden on the planning and administration of the Territory although, of course, the responsibility for providing services to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will remain with this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to package and compartment the population of the Northern Territory into <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to say that these are the health, education, welfare, transport and other services for Aboriginal people, and those are the services for nonAboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are perfectly entitled to regard that Territory as their own, just as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who may have an ancestry going back thousands of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The misconceptions relate to the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> overriding those of whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This surely is not a very big claim when one looks at the fact that one-third of the people are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and when one look at the fact that nearly all of these claims are for land that is unalienated Crown land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure they will agree also that this myth that 50 per cent of the land is being claimed by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to be vigorously exposed and the legitimate claims of the Aboriginal people spelt out in a way in which white people can understand and not feel threatened by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not on the voting rolls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a referendum in 1967, over 90 per cent of the people gave the Federal Government reponsibility for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there was a claim, in one instance, for 36 per cent of gross profits of uranium mining carried out on Aboriginal land to be paid to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have no right to enforce such a payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will be determined by other than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost certain that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will not get that 36 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again we see this distorted view that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have the best pieces of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been driven off those pieces of the country that white men wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when it suited some of those white settlers, squatters, developers or miners, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were not only driven off, they were put to death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members know that there is a percentage, however small- in fact it is shamefully small; around 30 per cent in many parts of Australia- of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies also to most <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very high incidence of alcoholism amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it is found in those who are unemployed and the depressed people who do not have this work facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we need to say that they are not to have any authority with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, although it must be remembered, as I would point out to the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham),  that the Commonwealth now has power with regard to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe the Commonwealth should pass section SI legislation affecting the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Australialegislating in a non-discriminatory way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he probably overlooked the fact that somewhere between one-fifth and one-sixth of the Territory is Aboriginal land anyhow under the reserves which were transferred to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paul Everingham has taken a very sound, commonsense and broadminded view about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been around the Territory, probably as much as most people, visiting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, explaining the situation to them, getting their confidence and generally playing the part of a well-briefed and understanding Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to Press reports concerning the establishment in Australia of an extremist and racist organisation known as the National Front which is calling for a policy of apartheid or separate development for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I thank the honourable gentleman for his question because it affords me an opportunity to deny in the most unequivocal terms that the present Government- indeed I expect this would be so of any government in Australiawill have a policy of apartheid or separate development for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noticed from Press reports that the National Front representatives in Australia have said that they propose to give a better deal to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy in that area is not one of separatism; it is a policy which recognises the particular and special relationship which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have for land which has been their traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when the land rights policy of the present Government, as shown through the land rights legislation, is properly understood it will be seen that it not only acknowledges the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> traditional relationship with land but also can provide the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, on a basis of equality, with a firm economic foundation for their future development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Wills brought about his selfdestruction by instituting overnight selfdetermination for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Committee that on Australia Day 1972 the then Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  announced that his government would not recognise the claims of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to ownership of land in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the type of employment proposed to be available for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in connexion with the activities which the applicant for the grant proposes to carry out upon the land; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition still feels the need, as it did at that time, to establish more definitely and more securely the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes it possible for him to take the initiative to gazette land for a particular purpose for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Act, or the Viner Act, makes no provision for the grant of interest to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in towns or for the grant of land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> where they already have an interest, such as the Gurindji at Wattie Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present Act, there is no specific provision, as was recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward, which would expand the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to enter upon pastoral leases for traditional purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was directly contrary to paragraph 474 (iv) of the Woodward report which was implemented by the Labor Bill and which made it impossible for roads to be built over Aboriginal land contrary to the wishes of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice Woodward recommended that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves should control entry to Aboriginal lands- a power traditionally exercised by the Northern Territory Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Bill gave this power to the land councils and exempted any <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> from the need to have an entry permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Viner Act expands the right of entry of non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and limits those exempt from the permit requirement to Aboriginals living in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing Act, land councils no longer have- as they did under the Labor Bill- the duty to pursue on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> claims to land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Mining Industry Council said that claims on behalf of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for a share of mining royalties are unjustified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It objects also to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> seeking access to company books and records, including company projections and sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land is full of significance for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other commitments were that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should also determine how their land rights are to be used and that they should have the same rights as any other land owner to determine who enters the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some respects that is inadequate as I think <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to have more right than other people have to determine who enters their land as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> view their land as being communally owned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, when we are looking at the concept which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have of land rightsnamely, a communal, traditional and perpetual ownership of land by a group of people- I believe that there is a case for going beyond that provision which was adopted by the parties opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to have more than just the same rights as any other landowner to determine who enters their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should be recognised as having prime ownership of and prime claims to their land and the prime right to determine the utilisation of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that priority ought to be given to what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want before plans for streets and towns start to be laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that priority ought to be given to consulting <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> before a Minister makes a decision or before a commissioner makes a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose some fairly innocuous amendments here and there to the effect that not only should consultation occur but also should the Minister have regard to the opinions of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have determined at a referendum that matters concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> ought to be matters of Federal concern and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, I think that in a mere theoretical approach to this subject one ought to be able to see that a Federal government is more likely to succeed in achieving justice for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the very reason of our Federal structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until this division occurred, anyone who travelled from Groote Eylandt to Arnhem Land and down through the centre would have seen how the blacks and whites were getting on together and moving together to see that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> received recognition and their fair share of the development that took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we must do- I think I mentioned this earlier- is look out for the political and legal pressures from either side which are telling the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> various things which, in many cases, are not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to those honourable members who have made so much of the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Woodward, on whose report the whole land rights legislation was based, that he was instructed, as the shadow Minister said, to determine how to allocate the land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not whether it should be allocated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was that  Mr Justice  Woodward ‘s report was about how to grant the lands to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not whether it should be or not, and that report was not debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This person goes on to say that he knows for a fact that the claim that this man Toby Gangali is the traditional owner in this area was made by an anthropologist from the University of Queensland who did a six months’ genealogical history of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in western Arnhem Land and six weeks on the mudguard of a Landrover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in various areas demand their own representations instead of having one large land council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably it was accepted because there was not enough evidence on the other side from traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> saying what they really wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be listening to the advisers who are telling us, telling the newspapers, telling the Opposition, telling the Government, what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must go there and find out what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we should all be trying to get the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Europeans to live and work together to develop the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen repeatedly in the care of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in the care of North American Indians, in the care of groups of people of all ages who are disadvantaged in North America and elsewhere, that the provision of more of the same, when health costs are going through the ceiling due to modern technology, does nothing to improve health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Can he say whether recent Queensland legislation (a) excludes (i) from Aurukun Shire, traditional Aurukun tribal land to the south of the former reserve, and (ii) from Mornington Shire, Bentinck Islands and Sweers Island, thus reflecting the State Government’s concern with the phosphate and bauxite industries rather than with Aboriginal sacred land and traditional land ownership, (b) fails to enable <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the Church to own or set up buildings or business projects within the leased Shires or the Council to acquire property anywhere, (c) fails to define who is to fill vacancies on the Councils, (d) provides administration under a complicated Local Government Act thus ensuring that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot manage their affairs and enables the State Minister for Local Government to appoint an administrator in place of the Councils, (e) provides for an externally appointed committee to assist the State Government in control and management of the communities which are supposedly run by Aboriginal representatives according to published statements, (f) excludes Church representatives from providing services other than religious instruction by persons ordinarily employed by the Church for that purpose and (g) gives the State Minister veto power over Council decisions to advise or exclude persons from their Shires and to appoint the Shire Clerk, who need not be qualified and is to be assisted in financial matters by the appointed committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister believes the core of his Government’s policy regarding Aboriginal advancement is summed up in the term ‘self-management’ then let him tell that to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of Woorabinda who ask for Federal Government takeover when delegates go to Aboriginal conferences and other organisations but are too frightened even to allow their elected representative, a Labor senator, to go there in fear of political repercussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry pointed out, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have never before been confronted with such important matters requiring a knowledge of a negotiating system utterly foreign to their traditional methods of consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this has happened in less than nine months, while the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have constantly been reminded by the media, the Government and the uranium developer that mining will get the go-ahead this year, that the Federal Government controls the uranium-bearing land, that rnining will go ahead no matter what the traditional land owners want, and that negotiations must conclude and will conclude before the wet season this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government thrusts the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council and an executive member of the Council into a room with the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and their hatchet man, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and insists on definitive discussions about what the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see as the apocalyptic destruction of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wrote to you on 24 August, drawing your attention to the fact that, unless Aboriginal communities deeply affected were given the opportunity quietly to discuss the issues involved in the proposed agreement between the Government and the Northern Land Council, and to reach a consensus about them, any so-called agreement would command no sense of commitment to it from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been hurled into one of the most acrimonious debates this country has ever seen and they’re not equipped to cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say that the Government has acted in a way in which the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill was originally drafted and proposed to allow the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to negotiate on the terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of these negotiations- although not precisely part of them but a part of the overall package- there were lengthy discussions relating to the National Park, the involvement of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the National Park and an agreement with the Northern Land Council as to the administration of that park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Zorn yesterday agreed the Ranger deal did not pay royalties as high as those received by American indians but, in the long term, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would catch up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us bear in mind that many of us, especially those from the Territory, at the time said that these large land councils- there were then two of them- were the wrong concept and that they were unkown and unappreciated by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> under their traditional land law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the aspect about which I am concerned because I do not think that provision is being made for the long-term continuation of a reasonable policy in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before we allow to pass out of the control of this Parliament the determination of the rights and privileges of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, including the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to live their own lives, I think proper and carefully set out legislation which deals with the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their rights to live in the manner in which they wish to live in the Northern Territory should be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be a tragedy if we were to adopt policies such as those being espoused in Queensland, for instance, where the aim of the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement in that State is the assimilation of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Australia should not be obliged to accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obligations to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> rest on this Parliament quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absolutely essential that we should assert the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to be <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, all the evidence indicates that both this Government and the existing State Governments which have under their control large numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are allowing a similar situation to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last week, the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  has been saying that if certain mining contracts were not signed then the land rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory could be in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not mean that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should become part of the white community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about the whole business of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the whites, or Ballanda, as they say on the North Coast, is that they live in the Northern Territory and so do we. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise- and I have discussed this at great length with Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who agrees with me- that if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to get all the money in the world from royalties, or all the power in the world through the land rights legislation, it still would not do them the slightest good if the rapport between blacks and whites were destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it in this place, and from the comments made by people in the South, it strikes me that the intention is to destroy that rapport between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Europeans and others in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear them talking about the traditional rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and of the pressures being placed on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are coming from amongst the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They should instead be examining the real beliefs of the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If you go and sit down in the scrub in the shade under a mulga, or a whitewood tree somewhere and discuss with the traditional <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>- to whom I would not mind betting these people have never even spoken- you would be told that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> did not want to embrace these concepts; that they wanted to deal with a proper hospital in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So I just do not know where the honourable member’s Party stands in regard to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, in respect of which it has two differing policies; or in its policy concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, in respect of which it is espousing something which is completely wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have funds not been restored since the dramatic cuts of the first Liberal-Country Party Budget but also recently this Government has resorted to trickery and manipulation of the Budget figures to make things appear better for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than they really are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the majority of these cases the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want to work because they want to earn their social security moneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All the time we must remember that the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, under which the Northern Land Council,  Dr Stephen  Zorn and the  Chairman  of the Council, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, are forced to work, does not allow <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to withhold consent for uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been done so that the separate allocation can be identified and shown to be the commencement of a special effort in this area to equip <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> with the management and other skills necessary to underwrite the Government’s policy of self-management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, nearly half of the total allocation for employment activities will provide additional employment opportunities for 650 <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> through special work projects in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to comment on some of the problems that will face the Government in the future in respect of the provision of employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a long term problem because in many of the more isolated rural areas where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> traditionally live there has been a decline in recent years in traditional forms of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular I refer to the situation with respect to employment on pastoral properties, a standard form of employment for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in years gone by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly perplexing for us and something that we have to scrutinise all the more diligently, because we know at least that the Premier of Queensland is opposed- he is prepared to take his opposition to extraordinary extremes- to the granting of any sort of real, permanent land rights to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only a few weeks ago that in a well publicised trip the Minister toured the Northern Territory and gave the actual titles of thousands of square kilometres of land to the tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who had successfully claimed that it had been their traditional tribal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is especially true when he talks of paying unemployment benefits to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or ‘sit down money ‘ as they call it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, while the Labor Party was in power it fostered this feeling among <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and we can see its terrible effects, if only in the alcohol problem and in their health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having travelled through many Aboriginal communities, he must surely realise that we cannot put tribal <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> straight into white man’s houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, one must be disappointed to find the Opposition using the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as pawns in its misguided and unsuccessful anti-uranium campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he able to say whether the Queensland Ombudsman,  Mr David  Longland, reported to the Queensland Parliament on 6 April 1 976, that ( a) the Aurukun people were in fear and angry because promises of consultation had been broken twice with regard to prospecting and mining and entry permission had not been sought and (b) associated Church dignitaries intervened to suggest that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not in retaliation break their promises, but be prepared to negotiate if the chance was finally offered to them to do so adequately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-46-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would never have had this outmoded method of waste disposal whereby we expect the people of South Australia, particularly the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who move across the area, to put up with the situation from the point of view of hazards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Reid has talked about the effects of radiation on the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the policemen and other personnel who have been working in this area and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can understandyour feeling that the ALP maybe using <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for their own vested interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the ALP may be using <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few minutes ago the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  asserted that I had stated that he cares less for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than he does for mining development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that before I went to Oenpelli this Minister who represents the Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had not even been to talk to the people of Oenpelli. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likely that the migrants, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the large families who are unaware of the possibility of finding a doctor who will bulk bill them will be deterred from seeking early treatment and thus will need hospital treatment later on, at even greater expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt but that if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to turn round tomorrow and announce that they welcome uranium exploration, these very champions would do a volte-face and insist with equal vehemence that the indigenous people have no prescriptive claim over unalienated Crown lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all these programs of the Department develop, measured merely in money or through the activities of the National Aboriginal Conference, the Council for Aboriginal Development or the Government’s land rights policies and other policies that honourable members will see in time to come, this Government will be able to look back upon its period of administration of Aboriginal affairs and say that it has given <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> a new look at the future- something for which they have been waiting for years and years but which has never been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been misrepresented because the Minister has been attributing to me the statement of  Mr Datta-Ray  who said that  Mr Muller,  a member of the staff of the honourable member for Reid, organised young people in Canberra who in his opinion would turn against <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> if <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> favoured mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in recent times certain parts off the ocean waters of the coast of the Northern Territory have more or less been made exclusive for fishing by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one takes into consideration the fact that our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would probably have to be subsidised or government money would have to be made available to equip them with suitable boats to fish the oceans off the Northern Territory and that our <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would probably lack the adapability to do mechanical repairs to their boats, together with the possible losses of boats in tropical storms that suddenly envelop the northern part of Australia, it could well be that it would be safer to engage the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in this sort of enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That information should be in a reasonable form and if possible in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ own language and not the complex legal language which was reported in this week’s  National Times  newspaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How else does the Labor Party explain the presence of  Mr Waters,  an executive member of the Northern Territory Labor Party, and  Mr James,  a member of the Labor Party, who are both solicitors, at Oenpelli a day before they were due to act as legal advisers to the meeting at which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were to decide their views on mining uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose those two members of the Labor Party were not trying to influence the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; they were just down there to look at the scenery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then goes on to state that the profession should not be allowed to fall to the literacy level of its clients and that, in particular, if we are to admit into the profession <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants, there will be a need for an elaborate course of indoctrination of those persons before they will be properly able to put into practice the ethics of the profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is saying that we do not have <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants in any great numbers in the law now and yet the law is struggling ineffectually against the evils of a type of morality in our society brought forth by some classes of big business and by some classes of trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the problem is already with us, then it is with us not because of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and migrants but because of pre-existing difficulties in our society arising from improper behaviour among various people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister has answered a question of mine recently by saying that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> agreed to a six months trial of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement is in Une with the Government’s practice of saying that it will do something and then consulting with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> after the event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition acknowledges that these principles have been put forward, to a large extent, by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The feedback from the grass roots level should be heeded and should have effect because if it does not <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will continue to cop out of the decision-making processes as has been their traditional role, taught to them by bitter experience over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Northern Territory News  has been giving the Minister about half a page at a time to explain his attitude to and sympathy with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the success of the trachoma program and the continuing government concern for the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, has any consideration been given to similar programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since his Government took office it has been noted for fine words and not for inspiring actions to promote the rights of the original trustees of his own country, its own <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor has the drafting of the lease ever remotely involved <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would rather have spent that money on their outstations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There may be a good reason for spending the money on a new airstrip but it is a secret to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great champions of the underdog sell out the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to State lighters and miners for 30 million pieces of silver or in some cases a lot less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have struggled for the right to see a lease taken out on their own land, the right to build on it, to decide who enters their homes, whether they can collect the rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as the Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had begun to reach a stage of feeling that they had some influence in determining their future, the Fraser Government heavies came in and seduced, sabotaged, destroyed and enslaved what organisation they had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He may not know- he certainly would not give any credit for it- that the policy which Queensland is about to introduce will give the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of those two areas, Aurukun and Mornington Island, 50-year leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very disappointing to hear the honourable member for Capricornia, who is a former Minister, speak about the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory as he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He described the treatment of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in signing the uranium mining agreement in the Northern Territory as sordid and shabby and said that they were under tremendous pressure from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to know why Galarrwuy Yunupingu made the statement that he wished the white solicitors who were members of the Australian Labor Party would get off the place and allow the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to make their own decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well known there amongst Europeans and <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that the ALP has done nothing at all for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> other than to try to manipulate them to its own political ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the fact that Aboriginal people and European people have to live together in harmony in Australia, something which the Labor Party in its policies has never realised or, it may have realised it, but its policies are directed to separatism and to building up ill feeling between <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the land rights legislation which was introduced in 1975 there was some hint of endeavouring to do for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> some of the things which were recommended by the Woodward report which, incidentally, was never debated or discussed in any parliamentary forum in this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that pretext most of the legislation concerning <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> has come into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not want the divisive sort of attitude which was introduced by the Labor Party in order to try to stir up trouble, whether over <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, uranium, land or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are acting to end the offensive paternalism of past policies towards <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have since had the Aurukun and Mornington Island situation, and what a tragedy that was from the point of view of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> being entitled to manage their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government introduced legislation relating to land tenure on the basis of the description of the sort of land it was going to try to protect in Queensland, the Opposition put an amendment stating very clearly that the land described by the Queensland statute as being trust land for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would remain their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has done nothing for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been left solely to the likes of Hinze and others to dictate what will be done in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the imposition of external pressures on the negotiations, particularly on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, by people who were pushing their own barrow and who had no interest whatsoever in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but only in their own hysterical opposition to uranium mining, I think it certainly says a great deal for all sides that the negotiations were successfully completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If therefore the Government proceeds to act on the basis of an agreement made under duress, by the Northern Land Council or by an arbitrator, without it being subjected to the processes required to develop a consensus, the Government and its partners in the ventures are likely to encounter situations in which individual <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or groups of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who feel their rights are being infringed will, in all good conscience, act in conflict with the terms of that agreement Such situations can be productive of grievance, hostility, and, potentially, violence and will damage further the already eroded confidence of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their friends among white Australians in the Government’s expressed concern for Aboriginal welfare and undertakings to protect their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, I would join with the member for Macarthur in condemning the members of the Opposition for their stirring of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory against the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The environmentalists, the Friends of the Earth, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Austraiian Labor Party have conducted a vendetta against the mining of uranium in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let him tell the Maningrida people, whose chosen advisers he personally sacked after consultation not with the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but with the white cronies of those the Aboriginals did not want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-44-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to knock those communities, but I must stress that wherever the Minister steps in personally to proclaim government initiatives for self-management, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have learned to watch out for a new act of betrayal and dispossession to help a State, a mining company, or an exploiting European. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-44-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was within the capacity of the Minister to make the funds available to purchase it, but the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> heard of the purchase of Mount Isa Mines only after the event A white caretaker sits there and the traditional owners retreat to the wooded outskirts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-44-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They were hoping for a draft lease for Aurukun, or an acknowledgement by the Northern Land Council that it would consult with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on their ground in their style and time scale, or perhaps an undertaking that there will be a tightening up of mistakes, such as those made in the appointment of the NAC secretary or in the Stawell Timber Industries deals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that nobody would make that suggestion, but the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Advancement in Queensland,  Mr Porter,  has warned us that that is what is coming, that if we keep giving land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> the black power will come and get us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) I am informed that my Department received a copy of a research proposal entitled ( Causes of Otitis Media in Aboriginal Children of the Northern Territory from the Secretary of the Medical Research in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Sub-committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) on 28 October 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal was discussed between representatives of my Department, the  Chairman  and Secretary of the Medical Research in <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Sub-committee of the National Health and Medical research Council and the principal investigator mentioned above in Canberra on 17 December 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like him, I stress that one of the major glaring deficiencies in the field of Aboriginal health is the physical environment- so much so that, as the  Chairman  pointed out, the figures collected in Western Australia indicate that the incidence of conditions related to the physical environment treated in hospital is eight times higher for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> than for non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that is required today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am most disappointed in recent statements from the Department and from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  which indicate that the priorities remain not in favour of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but in favour of mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While mining is important to Australia, some consideration should be given to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, who have been kicked around for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost daily, and certainly weekly, objections are coming on to my desk, and I have no doubt on to the Minister’s desk, about how <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are being required to tolerate more bureaucratic interference, not from Aboriginal organisations but from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Department of Health and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to start putting consumers in charge of health services, not only for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but for everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst in the body of the report there is stress on the need for land rights and the central importance of land rights for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to regain their self-identity, which is essential to achieving a healthy life, a healthy community and a healthy individual, that was not listed among the principal recommendations of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to put on record, and I believe that this view is shared by the other members of the Committee, that we see land rights as being essential to the ability of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to return to their source of spiritual refreshment and social cohesion, that is, the land with which they identify in a very complex and important manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be appreciated that the report, however long, cannot cover fully the subject of the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It it felt that the health of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would not be as bad as it is if all Federal and State departments and authorities had accepted over the years their full responsibility and seen <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as part of a total community, albeit a disadvantaged group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that the Federal Government make very clear its commitment to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and make extra efforts to ensure that all Federal and State departments and authorities accept their full responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make no mistake, there is a backlash against the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, or more particularly against the payment to them of large sums of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that another department or authority is not doing its job well enough in relation to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is not a reason for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to take over that function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be the ombudsman of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to ensure that they get a fair go from all authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must look to co-operation with the States to ensure the proper use of federal money given to the States for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could easily arrive at an opinion that more and more money is spent on <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, with the feeling that money must help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a number of recommendations which commend themselves, some of which are the recommendations for increased funding of research to universities; a rational transfer of credits between institutions; return to full triennium funding; better labour statistics and facilities for manpower planning; the need for a special effort to increase numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in skilled trades; the endorsement of migrant education; wide access of skilled trades to women; special efforts to improve numeracy and literacy skills; greater flexibility in staffing of universities; special attention to the needs of the handicapped and arrangements to be negotiated with the civil services, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, industry and other universities for exchange and secondment of staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Council of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement in South Australia recently announced that, due to insufficient funds being made available by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, it is no longer able to provide legal aid to all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for all matters requiring legal assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council of the Movement considers that, at its present level of funding, it is inevitable that legal aid for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will become inferior by comparison with legal aid provided to non-<span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement was founded in 1970 in response to a situation in which a majority of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> appearing before the courts had no legal representation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Movement first applied to the Federal Government in 1972 for financial assistance to provide legal assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and received a grant of $22,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Labor Party came to power in December 1972, it further funded Aboriginal legal services throughout Australia on an expanded basis such that the Aboriginal legal services could provide legal assistance to all <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in all matters where assistance was required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In raising this matter of public importance the Opposition is condemning the Government for its failure to fulfil its obligations to protect the human rights and the right to self-determination of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent weeks we have been inundated with complaints by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as to what is wrong with their treatment in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Every other State is able to satisfy the claims, the needs and demands of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but not Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a referendum the Australian people were asked: ‘Should the Commonwealth Government have the authority to look after people such as the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> or the Torres Strait islanders’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why we must discuss this subject as a matter of public importance is that we have not only the power to legislate in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> but also an international obligation to protect their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his own submission, which has never been disclosed to this Parliament, he spoke of what should be done by the Queensland Government to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in accordance with our obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman’s own government in 1975, when it was in office, passed the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When will the units be made available for the homeless <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> sleeping daily in Rockhampton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) How many Aboriginal youths in the Electoral Division of Grey have received apprenticeships under the National Employment Scheme for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has infant mortality among Northern Territory <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> risen to 75 per 1000 live births since 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) What have been the results of programs initiated by his Depanment to educate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on their voting rights and how to use them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-1-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect, I put it to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who represents the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this chamber, that it is his Government that is unaware of the political realities in the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ fight to regain their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do I need to point out the political and judicial reality of illegal actions by the Western Australian Liberal Party to deny an equal voice to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in an election for the seat of the Kimberleys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how can this happen when we force on them local government administrations which have no relationship to the activities that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see themselves as performing as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and in deciding and correlating in Aboriginal ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government has refused to fund those land councils which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves set up because it argues that the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission and the National Aboriginal Conference have the necessary funds to do the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He shows how <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and their culture are destroyed by white economy, white industries and white social customs introduced on a cold cash and contact basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is not opposed to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> agreeing to mining on their land as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu said he wonders why <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are the first people to have their compensation payments taxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After costly negotiations, which incidentally used up a great deal of such royalties that accrued to the Northern Land Council, and after months of delay caused by the mining companies, which were cheeky enough to blame these delays on the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the Ranger royalties were set at a much higher level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, environmental protection is not just for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the royalties paid will still be far short of some of those paid in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the amount spent on Aboriginal affairs will be whittled away further, as has happened in the past three years, depending upon how much the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> get in royalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be well within the capacity of existing budgets for the total amount which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will receive in royalties- about $12 a week a head- to be cut out entirely from Aboriginal funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is to force that tax on those people who mostly subsist below the poverty line, let those taxes be used to provide some backup expertise to advise the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on how to get the best long term result from that money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As much of it will benefit the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as does now when most of the money allocated to Aboriginal affairs goes to white bureaucrats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But eventually, slowly, it will effectively be administered for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as  Mr Shann  Turnbull pointed out- the businessman engaged by the Minister to talk about the impact of those royalties- it will not be long before the money is in the pockets of the white people anyway because all of those consumer goods and capital goods which I have mentioned will not be provided by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> paying other <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for the goods, but mainly by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> paying white people for the goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the people who will determine some of that spending are not interested in seeing that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are protected from the profit-seeking of people who go there to sell plonk, to pressurise people into the consumer society and to buy some of the items which I mentioned, which they can live without, whether it be cordials, or cornflakes or the charter flights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be ready to help and to protect the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to put some curbs on the exploiters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not only conclude treaties of commitment to compensate conquered <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but also we should ensure that compensation paid is lasting in its effect and not a mere fireworks display for a part of one generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory government, having blackmailed the Federal Government into getting a 1  Va  per cent royalty on uranium, ought to do its share, as its economy receives a boost from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>’ mineral royalties which it hopes, as  Mr Shann  Turnbull has predicted, will make it the richest, lowest taxed region in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no more widespread myth among know-it-all old hands in the Territory than the myth that illiterate <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> average bigger incomes than do unemployed whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Territory built its wealth mainly, perhaps, on cattle, using <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> as slave labour and turning their abundant land into grazing leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the closure of store and health facilities for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, a refusal to employ <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> on station work, a refusal to sell them petrol or to cash welfare cheques, threats to close roads to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and to drive them from the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, what does the Government intend to do to enforce a proper respect for the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Lake Nash and to restore the credibility of its Aboriginal Affairs policy which has been sadly tarnished by its neglect of the intolerant attitudes of King Ranch? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Shann  Turnbull advocated in his report that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> should not pay taxation on the royalties, but he went on to advocate that the Commonwealth Government should not provide funds for health or education services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggests that on the figures available to him- the mining of 3,000 to 6,000 tonnes of uranium ore at $30 to $40 a tonne- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of the Northern Territory could expect to receive between $160 and $600 each per annum, which is less- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the amount involved will be far below the sum that is presently provided in the Northern Territory for services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested last night, in the course of the debate, that if the Government felt so disposed it would be possible for it to eliminate a corresponding proportion of the money that it now spends on services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, as Aboriginal organisations will be getting royalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> now receive let alone, as  Mr Turnbull  would suggest, all of the other public services provided in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these royalties, in themselves, provided good and sufficient compensation for all of the suffering of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at the hands of the Western commercialised society of whites, we would not be quibbling about 6.4 per cent of it being taken away for taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how many submissions he has made on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider it would be adequate if the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were allowed to make decisions for themselves as to what they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That suggestion was rejected, not by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, not by the Northern Land Council, not by any of their legal advisers, not by the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, or any of the organisations that will be collecting royalties on their behalf; it was rejected by white bureaucrats- administrators- and the Government whose members sit opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was one of the propositions that would have been acceptable to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but the cost was too much for the white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government bought Ranger and sold out the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing to realise is that a lot of these claims and counter-claims on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are not doing the Aboriginal cause any good at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have told honourable members for the last 12 or 13 years- ever since I have been in this House- it is a matter of getting the right people to work with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> so that they will develop alongside the whites, in the Northern Territory or anywhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Magellen Petroleum has laid out $19m, and it is still battling with the urgers who are trying to tell the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that they do not want that oil explored and brought into production, as do the Yuendumu miners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the House accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay and urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand the honourable member for Fremantle was trying to argue that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would have absolutely nothing and that it is unconscionable to charge this 6.4 per cent tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the money will be disposed of in a way that is at least as responsible as the way that government departments have disposed of it because it will be disposed of primarily by Aboriginal organisations, which, by and large, get better value per dollar for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and put less into white administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, why are <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> singled out for such taxes contrary to international conventions, British custom and Australian precedents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A decision to continue planting would rank with the decision to spend millions of dollars on resource inventory in the hope of a woodchip export, for which there never has been any possibility because of the constant burning of forests by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Were funds refused the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League of Victoria for a Victorian Aboriginal Women’s Refuge during 1 978-79; if so, on what grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-119-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A women’s refuge primarily for Aboriginal women and operated by the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Advancement League, Northcote, is included in the Victorian program of women’s refuges approved for funding under the Community Health Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-119-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly, for example, to the agreement with New South Wales- the previous  speaker  referred to New South Wales- signed in 1975 by the Federal Government, that the Federal Government would pick up the tab for all services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has not been done and there is still grave deficiency in the services to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in all States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in many instances <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would prefer other kinds of commitments, particularly quicker moves towards self-management, which is something that is being eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many areas white bureaucracy is increasingly taking over functions from <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are thought in Public Service terms not to be responsible in their bookkeeping, their auditing or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assistance to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is reduced in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same people who tell stories about the unemployed, used to recite how they knew someone who knew someone else who knew someone else who had lived amongst <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and how, when a government or council authority had built them houses, they would chop up the doors for firewood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the rate of spending in this Budget it would take 30 years to accommodate those <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who are at present on the waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are deprived people and yet we hear complaints from the white population- particularly in areas where they are aware of the existence of high Aboriginal populations within their community- that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are getting preference for housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to health, another area of wellknown deprivation where <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are far behind the rest of the community, spending is down on last year by 1  lh  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Virtually every Aboriginal health program around Australia- run by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> more efficiently than by government departments or private enterprise- is complaining about the cuts and the need to restore the sorts of services that they want to give <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes to any Aboriginal health service in Australia, which is run by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, one will find that it is in modest surroundings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the position is that with only one in every 50 Aboriginal children, representing 2 per cent, going beyond grade 9, as compared with nearly one in four white children, representing 24 per cent, going beyond grade 9, there are cuts in this most needy area of education, the education of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost as though <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have votes or the Government does not want them to have votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Probably more <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> would be willing and able to register if they were assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ninety per cent of all employed <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are unskilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area where there should be encouragement to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to manage their own affairs, to become independent and self-reliant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Commission is the only means open to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to purchase land in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In most cases <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have to be much more desperate than white people before they will appeal for legal help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the short time remaining I should like to refer to some of the aspects that do not bear particularly on the Budget but on what I see, and on what increasing numbers of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> see, as the inhumane priorities of this Government in contemplating Aboriginal concerns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> were brushed completely aside and ordered to sign something that they did not understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any priority or concern left or any need to salvage some of the Government’s credibility against the outrage of the public and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> come after all those other commercial priorities and political Federal-State relations priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the real point behind these figures of neglect and betrayal of promises and duties to Aboriginal people by a Federal government which was given a mandate in every polling booth in Australia, at a referendum in 1967, to look after <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to draw attention to the position of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the record of Queensland Government surveys of what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> want and should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is supposed to be a member of the Liberal Party but obviously he is one of the totalitarians who has the ultimate say in what happens to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, have <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> been excluded from these negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the book concur with these investigations and policy in insisting that constant and sympathetic contact with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is required to prevent squandering of funds on the European-devised programs now entrusted to officials with little opportunity to achieve such contact: if so, is any action being taken to correct the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-41-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had no report in detail to this Parliament as to how these tapes were distributed, what facilities the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> had for listening to them, whether the proposal was discussed with them after they had heard these tapes and, if they heard them, whether they were told that this would be the basis of the ultimatum that was being offered to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that we can negotiate a single agreement with a body that speaks for all of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> of this country, but that is a matter for them to determine and to negotiate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the land rights issue has been expressed in the policies and platforms of all the major parties as a matter which is vital to the preservation of Aboriginal culture and to the recognition of the right of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to their identity and to selfmanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> do not have some guarantee of land that they can call their own, of some permanent economic structure to replace that land in cases where they cannot be permanently identified with it, then we are condemning them to an inferior status which should not be tolerated in this day and age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, if one were to offer a mere $ 12,000- such people are probably worth more than that, but let us choose a modest sum- the magnificant number of 78 people, in all, could be employed to serve the whole of Australia, including <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and all members of the ethnic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister support any proposal by <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> that back pay, due to them for the 6 months before proof of underpayment, might be given to their community in the form of land titles to the whole of their gazetted and/or traditional land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the government give adequate self-development funds to genuinely autonomous Queensland communities and deduct corresponding amounts from Federal grants to Queensland over a period of years corresponding to the period during which <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been underpaid by Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that (a) <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and Torres Strait Islanders are trained to take over management of their communities in Queensland without inhibitions due to control by others of their domiciles, movements, transport, communications, employment, political activity or equal access to public amenities, ( b ) Aboriginal and Islander communities have similarly unfettered rights to (i) negotiate terms of entry to their land by mining interests, (ii) expand Federal Government grants with responsibility to Federal sources of State intervention and (iii) acquire joint ownership of pastoral or other leases or freehold land directly or through a Land Council or Federal authority as freely as other Australian or foreign interests do or to have reasons for refusal given to them or Federal authorities and (c) those aspects of Queensland law which breach Federal laws or international conventions on human rights are overridden and State Officials who breach these laws or conventions are punished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that this be done not only because of present industrial matters in Western Australia but also because it would help in Queensland in regard to street marches, and it would help in Western Australia from the point of view of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> having equal voting rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact I go so far as to say that some of those wishing to promote them as tourist sites ought to be discouraged so that no person, apart from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves and genuine students of Aboriginal art works and rock paintings in particular, is able to visit those sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This particular report was of great social and political importance not only to the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who were the subject matter of the inquiry but also to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> throughout Australia who are entitled to proper treatment on the basis of the referendum result carried by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is on the basis that the police are trying to protect themselves from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under that Act the community council, which comprises the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves, can request the Minister to give the community autonomy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same issue is involved when it comes to the question of award rates for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the Queensland Government says in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>: ‘We cannot afford to pay them full award wages so we will pay them only half wages’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This came to light in particular at the time when the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities were seeking to have self-management of their own communities and of their own reserve lands free of domination by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement under the Queensland <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To mention some salient positions, he was  chairman  of the Australian Universities Commission, Secretary to the Prime Minister’s Department, Secretary to the Department of the Environment, <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the Arts, a member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission,  Chairman  of the Snowy Mountains Council, and Secretary to the Department of Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, what would be the position if we were to have some other country decide to carry out investigations into some occurrences here in our own country in respect of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>; in respect of some happenings in the States of Queensland and Western Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it includes <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>, but it certainly ought to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A purist might argue that when the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> came to Australia a long time ago they came across land and did not have to swim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also proposed that the provision whereby loans were made available from the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> Benefits Trust Fund should continue to apply in respect of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Government as soon as possible should extend by legislation the rights of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian Capital Territory ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this amendment amounts to is that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> at Wreck Bay have had their reserve land progressively whittled away in the interests of the sort of economic exploitation that has occurred in relation to Aboriginal land from the day of white settlement in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account formula is for 40 per cent of the royalty payments for minerals extracted from the land to be paid to land councils, 30 per cent to be paid to the local traditional owners of the land concerned, and the remaining 30 per cent to be paid towards the general welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That formula is to be departed from by taking some money out of the 30 per cent for the general welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory and giving it to the land councils to cover extra administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, that is not laid down in the terms of the Ranger agreement, but there is an understanding which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> are entitled to have honoured in the 40:30:30 formula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also provision in the Bill for legal aid to be given to persons other than <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> who appear before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, his discussion of the move to have the Wreck Bay settlement and the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Australian Capital Territory included in these considerations was completely out of order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I represent the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and the other people who live in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were lined up against the Commonwealth Government and the Department of the Northern Territory, and all the legal aid which was bought and paid for by the Commonwealth Government, was on the side of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has lived and worked with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> for 40 years, I know that they are a very fair and understanding people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of what has been perpetrated in what one might call the Utopia land case, and this all pertains to this Act and the remarks that were made at great length in the Senate- 45 minutes a throw; good heavens!- the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> said: ‘We would like to be the same as white people of Central Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring up this matter because of the misrepresentation by the Australian Labor Party, the media, and by other people, who consider that they are the ones who should interpret what <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Borroloola land claim once again was objected to by the advisers and urgers who were trying to get the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> to block access across the Borrolooa common, which runs from the hinterland to the McArthur River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> into conflict with the other people, whites or whoever they may be in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, that is something which the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> themselves do not wish, and they say that over and over again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my remarks not just to members of the Labor Party but also to anyone who deals with <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that all members of the Labor Party imagine that they are doing something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They imagine they are doing something for the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the point I am making to the members of not just the Labor Party but also my own party and anyone who is interested or thinks he is interested or tries to be interested or, if I may say so, tries to bluff other people that he is interested in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It indicates to me that the honourable member knows nothing and cares nothing about <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would not expect to hear it from the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham),  a former Labor Minister who is sitting at the table because he understands the plight of the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill aims to help <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> and whites- claimants and defendants- to live together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> cannot get control of their burial grounds which are of great significance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Land to <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> is their religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) How many <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> have been recruited as welfare officers in the Department of the Northern Territory Development Branch and its successors in each year since 1 970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are non-Aboriginals preferred as foster parents for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recognise Federal Government undertakings in 1975 to relieve the NSW Government of financial responsibility for essential public funding of services for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a report in the  Northern Territory News  of 4 September 1979, claiming that ( a )  Mr Solomon  Nayilibity, employed for some years by Queensland Mines as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer, lived with his family for about 6 months in a core shed belonging to the company, (b) the shed and a nearby tank containing radioactive samples were marked as radioactive, (c) the company has claimed that (i) unmineralised dust samples only were in the shed and were not dangerous and (ii)  Mr Nayilibity  did not mention any fears of radiation to a company spokesman who saw him during August 1979, (d) the company has not replied to  Mr Nayilibity  ‘s request for a medical test, (e) the test would be unlikely to disclose irradiation effects which might take decades to appear, (f) uranium samples were spilt from a split bag over a former company exploration camp site and registered more than the maximum 5000 microrems/hour on a counter, 85 times the safe public exposure limit and (g) <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> hunt and camp in the area but the company has no commission to re-enter the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are official domination, intimidation and paternalism for Aboriginal people in Queensland substantially worse than those for <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in other States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were private companies required, as their part of the bargain, to keep an equivalent number of <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> employed with their own funds for an equivalent period of time after the Department of Aboriginal Affairs’ grant had been spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-78">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he confer with the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs and, as recently suggested by me, set up a programme to train men and women so that a team of experienced practical people may be brought into being in order to undertake the long and hard job of leading and teaching the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> in the Northern Territory to develop their own vast resources for their own benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>I do not think that the <span class="highlight">Aborigines</span> will think very much of us and very much of our politics if we start playing any further with their anguish, sorrow and distress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></li>
