    <p>My hope was that the Attorney-General would be prepared to explain why, in contradistinction to the initial attitude he adopted when the first version of this Bill was before the Senate, he has now responded to the suggestion of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and desires to have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that one of the members of that Committee- I think there are only two of them in the chamber at the moment- could likewise proceed to give reasons why they prefer a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court as distinct from State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do so basically for the reasons already put forward by  Senator Everett,  but I add to them that the practices and procedures of this court will be of particular importance if we are to meet the ambitions that I think Parliament has for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the cost of each official and unofficial visit to Australia by members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> since November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received letters from the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Carrick)  and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  nominating senators to be appointed members of a Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Senators Coleman, Davidson, Melzer, Missen and Walters, having been duly nominated in accordance with the resolution of the Senate of 17 August 1978, as varied on 28 September 1978, be appointed members of the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the problems that certainly arise in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court generally because of the number of matters with which it has to deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will refer the specific question raised by  Mr Justice  Muirhead to the Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and discuss the matter with her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, we feel very strongly that we do not want any interference from the Government in the payment to families of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If she has the custody, care and control of the children and the children are with her she would be paid a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned there is not the problem that  Senator Cavanagh  has raised, particularly if he is talking about a divorced woman or a <span class="highlight">family</span> breakup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also significant for the individual car buyer as the price of an average <span class="highlight">family</span> car costing around $7,000 at the  21Vi  per cent rate should now be some $530 less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s very substantial refugee program is intended to provide opportunities for a new life to as many as possible of those in refugee camps, commensurate with Australia’s absorptive capacity, <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion considerations, the needs of the individual refugees and the resettlement opportunities available for them in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leaveLast week, I had the opportunity to travel to Tasmania to pay personally my respects to Eric Bessell ‘s widow and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel a very personal grief at the passing of Eric Bessell- a young man, at 55, with a comparatively young <span class="highlight">family</span> of six children, of each of whom he was enormously proud, and deserved to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I would like to be associated with the previous speakers in expressing condolences to the wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> of Eric Bessell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that he was one of the few politicians able to acomplish the best of both worlds by being a good <span class="highlight">family</span> man as well as a good politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had great regard for Eric, as I still have for his widow and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It involves travelling time, <span class="highlight">family</span> dislocation, cost and other things which amount to a total <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution to politics and the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the light of the further increases in home loan interest rates which will cause acute hardship for persons on fixed incomes, will the Government give urgent consideration to introducing a moratorium on home loan repayments where the major income earner of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the present government, Justice Kemeri Murray, Justice Margaret Lusink and Justice Josephine Maxwell have been appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my speech during the second reading debate I referred to cases where workers may have been encouraged- a better word would be ‘exploited’- by a <span class="highlight">family</span> which conducted a business or restaurant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General whether a decision has been made to appoint a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge who will be permanently based in Townsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that courts exercising jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act have interpreted s. 64 ( 1 ) as authorising the making of orders preventing a parent having custody of children from removing children from a specified locality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a child is removed from one part of Australia to another, it remains, of course, within the jurisdiction of courts under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, so that a parent whose access to a child has been interrupted by such a removal of the child can make the appropriate application to a court having jurisdiction under the Act for restoration of previous access arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Attorney-General, in the light of the Government’s proposed action to prevent one parent taking children overseas without the consent or knowledge of the other, considered what steps might be taken, or be legally possible, to prevent one parent taking children interstate without the consent or knowledge of the other, where the children have been the subject of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court order granting access rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the case of a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> in a Sydney suburb receiving a gross income of $ 10,000 and wishing to buy an average home in that area for $45,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the <span class="highlight">family</span> saved 20 per cent of its income it would take 1 5 years to save the required deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we should tie ourselves because emergencies with <span class="highlight">family</span>, with constituents and with Party work can always arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these young men are at a stage of life when their greatest expense is upon them, when their greatest interest in work is with them, and when they have the problem of bringing up a young <span class="highlight">family</span> and paying a relatively high tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adequate measures to promote <span class="highlight">family</span> life, particularly in the fields of child endowment, maternity ‘ allowances and education; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They called for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the total effect of the cost-price pressures, inflation, tariffs and marketing methods on primary production and the rural community, with emphasis to be placed on the appraisement and assessment of new longterm development programmes to secure the retention of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as a major part of Australian agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are aware there are certain people who today say that the only remedy for the position in primary industry is to get rid of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm and institute huge collectivetype farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer next to the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some proposals in the Speech such as the remission of taxation which may have some favourable effect in regard to a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it would be better for the Government to retain the tax rates as they are and to provide for those people in the community who are underprivileged and for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this Government is falling down on the essential job of helping the <span class="highlight">family</span> and of helping to populate this country when it again fails to increase child endowment, when it leaves maternity allowances at the miserable rates at which they have been for so many years, and when in regard to education it still has not done all it should, although I must be fair and admit that the Government has done a lot in recent years for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will facilitate <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion as, in the past, for financial reasons, some Yugoslavs preceded their families here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst the poor are 10-year-old children who wear their mothers’ shoes to school or go barefooted in winter and girls of 12 years who are exempted by the authorities from going to school so that they can stay at home and care for the younger children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it mentions adequate measures to promote <span class="highlight">family</span> life’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that every Australian will welcome the occasion when, for the first time in our history, the Queen and her husband and <span class="highlight">family</span> will be with us for a visit, which we hope they will enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main it would be paid by the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should have more regard for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we support the idea that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basis of a nation or do we support a permissive society that disregards the <span class="highlight">family</span> and allows those things which have destroyed great civilisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet they come here and say to the Senate and to the people of Australia: ‘Let us have adequate measures to promote <span class="highlight">family</span> life’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reads in their amendment that members of the DLP are in favour of measures to promote <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They talk about how they support the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone in this chamber will ever forget the desertion by members of the DLP of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man when the measures to increase sales tax on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man went through this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not once, but twice - at the second reading stage and at the third reading stage - members of the DLP crossed the floor to vote with the Government and to put the sales tax on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What more pernicious lax could there be than that sales tax on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that we should not have this kind of tax on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same way, members of the DLP come here and say: ‘It does not matter that we have supported the Government, that we have abandoned the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, that we have not cared at all about these other matters and that we have an extremist foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a South Australian I am bound to say that I have some disappointment that no member of the royal party, which consists of four members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> on this occasion, is coming to our State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would be differences from State to State as to the number of bushels which provided a reasonable living for the farmer and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst  Senator Young  and  Senator Prowse,  representing the Liberal Party on the one hand and the Country Party on the other, certainly this evening have quoted figure after figure, statistic after statistic and percentage after percentage in respect of the Government’s general economic and rural policy, so far as wheat is concerned we say it is about time that the Government stopped looking only at figures, statistics and percentages and came down to the real and pressing problems of the man on the land, the small grower, his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> and those who live in rural areas, who rely on the stability of the wheat industry for their livelihood and economic security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the small wheat farmer and his <span class="highlight">family</span> who are involved principally in the crisis that confronts the wheat industry today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the small wheat grower, his wife and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and workers involved in the wheat industry 1 and other members of the Opposition criticise particularly the Minister for Primary Industry and the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the special circumstances now confronting the wheat grower and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, particularly the small grower and the worker in the industry, and the economic reliance of large and small rural towns for their continued progress on the wheat industry generally, the Opposition does not oppose this measure but urges the Government to put its thinking cap on and show some leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know of one instance in which a mother on the mainland badly needed the child endowment not in order to look after her children but merely to pay arrears of rent in respect of the very dilapidated little flat in which the <span class="highlight">family</span> lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the nonpayment of it caused much hardship for that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If he has a history of protest, if he has ever said on a government settlement that a wage of S8 or $10 a week is not sufficient to keep a <span class="highlight">family</span> or if he has ever protested about the living conditions under which he has had to exist on a government settlement, his name will never go on the list tor home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has asked on numerous occasions for assistance in purchasing or renting a home large enough to comfortably house himself, his wife and his <span class="highlight">family</span> of 9 or 10 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 homes were available but the man was told that he could not occupy either home because local by-laws stated that a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the size of his would not be permitted to live in a 3-bedroom home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the by-laws seem to be adjustable enough to allow that <span class="highlight">family</span> to live in sub-standard conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the Government gave him a small loan to allow him to go on to a little patch of ground about 6 acres in area that would not support bandicoots, let alone the man and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> groups were supposed to stay away from Yuendumu for two weeks but the girls ran away after 2 days and we went out and got the other people a day later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, married people have paid their taxes throughout the whole of their lifetime and have received poor allowances in terms of child endowment and taxation deductions for keeping a wife and rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span>, which contributes so much to our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the very virtue of marriage itself and of rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span> in this community should give the married couple the right to the advantage derived from their standard being increased slightly because their rate of pension is the same as that of single people and they pool their resources as they have done all their lives in rearing their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is tragic that these people are pushed into a field which is very competitive, particularly for those who have been rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span> for 15 or 20 years and find suddenly that they are forced to seek employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would like to join the Minister for Supply  (Senator Anderson)  in extending the heartfelt sympathy of everyone here to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and in putting on public record our feelings regarding the outstanding service which he performed under very difficult circumstances in this Parliament on behalf of the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was brought about because their <span class="highlight">family</span> had outgrown the first home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a returned serviceman who perhaps has been separated from his <span class="highlight">family</span> for some time and who wants to get into his own home instead of living with in-laws, 8 weeks can seem like half a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for us to sit in this House and say that it is only 8 weeks, but 8 weeks can be a long lime if you are living in circumstances which are not conducive to good relationships within your own <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is allright for the average indigenous person who has a <span class="highlight">family</span> of two to live in them, but when a man has 5 or 6 children it is absolutely hopeless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>on primary production and the rural community, emphasis to be placed on the appraisement and the assessment of new long term development programmes to secure the retention of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as a major part of Australian agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also contains provisions under which estates of deceased persons who had carried on their primary production activities through proprietary <span class="highlight">family</span> companies may qualify for the relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In requiring that shares which are the subject of an election be valued by reference to their assets backing value, the objective of the Bill is to place estates of shareholders in <span class="highlight">family</span> companies in a position that broadly corresponds with the situation which would have existed if the property represented by the shares had been owned by the deceased persons themselves instead of by their companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> companies will also enable estates in which shares in these companies are included to meet what I might refer to as the ‘income eligibility’ test; that is, the requirement that, for a deceased person’s estate to be eligible for the rebate, the major part of his income for the 5 years before his death must have been derived from a business of primary production carried on by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the income to be so treated, it will be necessary, firstly, for the company to have been a <span class="highlight">family</span> company throughout the year in which the deceased person derived the income and, secondly, for the company’s own income for that year to have been derived principally from a business of primary production carried on by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions of the Bill are designed to avoid the situation in which an estate containing rural assets would be ineligible for the reliefs because income from a primary production business in which the deceased person had an interest was derived by him through a <span class="highlight">family</span> company rather than directly through personal ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted the views recently expressed by a number of economists and commentators that the present crisis in rural industry calls for the abandonment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm and its replacement by large units, of the collective farm type, owned by big corporations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On another occasion I was confronted with the problems of a young <span class="highlight">family</span> which was in considerable difficulty in a number of directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> was living in a completely substandard home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I find these difficulties myself, how does the ordinary working person, the ordinary young person of 22 years or 23 years who has nol really made his mark in his particular industry or occupation and who has not reached a high level of income earning, possibly meet this situation of trying to provide for his young wife and the <span class="highlight">family</span> that he hopes to raise in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that they ought to be available right across the board for every Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> which needs a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we cannot find any institution in Australia that can provide that <span class="highlight">family</span> with a home on a deposit of $500, 1 think there is something wrong with the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We thought that in a developing nation such as Australia, with such a crying need for people, encouragement should be given particularly to young people so that they would have some hope of home ownership for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They concern mainly the smaller primary producers who find the greatest difficulty in meeting probate duty when the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and owner of the farm dies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some sort of legislation should bc introduced which will help the farming <span class="highlight">family</span> retain control of the property without having to realise on it in order to meet death duty, because this duty can be quite considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that I was going to try to keep politics out of my speech, but I think I of the problems at the moment is that there cannot be too much of a fuss made because the Premiers of all the Stales ure of the same political persuasion as the Commonwealth Government, lt is very difficult to criticise one’s own <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears obvious that the proposed changes are already operating because I have seen a Press statement to the effect that the Leader of the Opposition was permitted to take a member of his <span class="highlight">family</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader ofthe Opposition in another place, according to this Press statement, was permitted to take a member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> on a visit to New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1968 Tet offensive took 2 victims in my own <span class="highlight">family</span>: my younger brother, a non-commissioned officer in the ARVN and a published poet, and my nephew. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only much’ later, when I got word from my own <span class="highlight">family</span>, did I learn that they had been killed by the bombings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This happens not only with primary producers but also in many <span class="highlight">family</span> concerns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>has made great sacrifices in her lifetime to help build up a <span class="highlight">family</span> business, be it a farm or anything else, should see some of it taken away on the death of her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We live in a community in which there is a gradual flight from the land and in which the old and very satisfactory type of rural settlement - that is, the small <span class="highlight">family</span> farm with the diversified rural economy - is disappearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems for primary industry has been the inflated values of property and the problem that a primary producer has in trying to give some protection to his <span class="highlight">family</span> so that his dependants will have security when he is deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the tragedies of the situation is that having paid tax throughout your lifetime and having created an asset for your <span class="highlight">family</span>, estate duty is imposed when you die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a burden for which your <span class="highlight">family</span> should not be responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> experienced 2 or 3 years of drought after he died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a drought, the numbers of stock were depleted and the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income was down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes that <span class="highlight">family</span> a long time to develop the property again to the stage of good earning capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">family</span> is penalised because the father happened to die at the time when the property was in full bloom of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> of the deceased property owner has not done anything to cause an increase in land values, but it is penalised because of the high commercial values applying in the district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in many instances today we have the position, particularly with a downturn in income and a downturn in land values, where, because a man died 2 years ago - prior to the imposition of wheat quotas, to use an example - his <span class="highlight">family</span> is paying death duties which are based on the inflated price of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deceased’s <span class="highlight">family</span> may not have been the cause of the inflation in land prices because it may not have bought any land, but 3 or 4 properties in a district may have been sold at big prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is penalised for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the woman had never needed to be involved in the <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government has aimed its sights very correctly at the principle which was originally spelt out; that is, the purpose of these proposed reliefs is to provide assistance to discourage the breaking up of rural economic holdings, particularly <span class="highlight">family</span> holdings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proportion of assets which can be represented by rural holdings within genuine <span class="highlight">family</span> proprietary companies comes under the benefit of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> which held assets in a deceased estate was faced within 2 years with a demand by both State and Federal authorities for a sizeable amount of cash to pay the duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This forced the <span class="highlight">family</span> to place on the market assets which, perhaps under other circumstances, it would have been wise for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of maximum relief for the tax payer with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To offset the dissolution of stud properties and <span class="highlight">family</span> rural estates to meet probate duties; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To minimise the incidence of death duties so as to avoid the necessity for the forced sale of <span class="highlight">family</span> property where the estate is left to the wife and children of the testator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> groups were supposed to stay away from Yuendumu for 2 weeks but the girls ran away after 2 days and we went out and got the other people a day later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we had an example of this today when the Senate firmly and unitedly supported the provision of certain benefits to our rural community in relation to estate duty in order to prevent the breaking up of <span class="highlight">family</span> estates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The workers believe that the absence of price control is responsible for the present inflation that is affecting our whole economy and making it impossible for the ordinary working <span class="highlight">family</span> to live on present wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, these Ordinances include - an Ordinance providing for the interpretation of Territory Ordinances and statutory instruments; a Juries Ordinance providing for all aspects of jury service and, in particular, for women to serve on juries; an Ordinance making comprehensive provision with respect to maintenance of wives, husbands and children; a new Wills Ordinance; Ordinances enabling married persons to sue each other in tort; a number of amendments to the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance; an Ordinance facilitating the transfer of marketable securities; a new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Provision Ordinance - to ensure that the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a deceased person receive adequate provision out of his estate; an Ordinance enabling a person between the ages of IS and 21 years to borrow on the security of a mortgage of his home; amendments to the Administration and Probate Ordinance; and amendments to the Real Property Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he or any member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> does become sick he can write off a substantial part of his medical and hospital expenses as income tax deductions, whereas a man receiving only an amount, equal to the average weekly earnings must pay in contributions the same amount as a man who earns twice or three times as much and who may have only as many or even fewer <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider the average citizen in this country, at some time during his life he or she, or some member of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, will suffer from an illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important is the impact on a person who has contributed to a fund for years to cover himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any honourable senator who had a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> affected would be up in arms and would say that this system is nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that prior to this period the average Australian awed and revered the medical profession, in which he included the general practitioner, the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor - that great help at all times, the real guide, philosopher and friend - and then the specialist to whom one was referred if the general practitioner felt that professional specialist advice and action was required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view one of the weaknesses of the national health scheme has arisen - not from a legislative point of view, but from the viewpoint of the medical profession - when the old trad tion has not been followed of the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor referring a patient, if he thought fit, to a specialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Government’s decision that families on incomes which we, in this day and age, consider are not adequate for the proper sustenance of a <span class="highlight">family</span> should receive their medical benefits entirely free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has its disadvantages, lt may be said that in some States the lower fees were justified because of the difference in the cost of living and in the cost of maintaining a practice and a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not sufficient to say, as  Senator Webster  said, that they can only go to the specialist if they are referred by the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments were made to the National Health Act in September last year so that persons and <span class="highlight">family</span> units in receipt of an income of less than $39 a week would receive not only free government assistance to meet medical and hospital costs, but also free fund benefits for the same objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is illustrated simply by taking 2 people living side by side and both paying $100 a year for the protection of their <span class="highlight">family</span> and themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rate to the major Queensland medical fund will he 64 cents per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> is inconvenienced because of these few words in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that as a <span class="highlight">family</span> man it costs me $20.35 every 3 months to insure for hospital and medical benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I get ill, or if one of my <span class="highlight">family</span> gets ill and it is a serious illness which warrants an operation, it will cost the fund and the Commonwealth a lot more money than the S20.35 which I pay in contributions to the fund every 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could let my membership lapse at the end of 3 months and probably for a year or 2 years I could pay nothing into the fund until another illness or accident struck my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may have a larger <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sympathetic as always to the indigent or the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who might find difficulty in contributing to a medical benefit society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot reconcile the Opposition’s desire to pay a Commonwealth benefit to a person who is not in the category of the indigent or the hard pressed <span class="highlight">family</span> man and who has the capacity to contribute to the scheme but does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact remains that if a man was responsible and his <span class="highlight">family</span> started to increase he felt that he had to have security., insurance or protection if he could afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He felt that he had a responsibility to his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> and himself to have some insurance in the event of sickness, particularly his own sickness, he being the breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I felt that I had a responsibility to my wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> to do so, because in the event of my illness they would get something from the friendly society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said, I think a man with a big <span class="highlight">family</span> and in receipt of a low income would experience difficulty in budgeting for his contribution to a medical and hospital benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they can afford to take the risk so far as health insurance of themselves and their families is concerned they are paying taxation at a pretty high rate, much higher than the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> man in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is the situation of - for want of a better term - the more humble man in the community, the man who cannot afford the $1.80 a week or whatever the amount is to insure his <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But bearing in mind the circumstances I have set out and looking at the situation from the point of view of the humble man in the community, this amendment will mean a great deal and certainly it will give the underprivileged man, the ordinary working man in the community and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man his just entitlement; he will receive something back for the amount that he contributes to the public purse by way of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is not asking too much of anybody to make a weekly contribution towards this health scheme for the protection and welfare of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise with the Minister the case of the male, the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, who is receiving treatment and benefits under the Tuberculosis Act and whose dependants may require medical or hospital treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were set down as an encouragement to persons to go into hospital and be treated for tuberculosis knowing that there was sufficient income for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to live on while the treatment was being received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only is  Mr Limb  a man of great fame throughout the Australian community but 1 have the honour of being able to say that he and his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> are very close personal friends of mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thank sincerely the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Anderson)  for having made reference to the recent death of the former Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and also for his expression of condolence to be conveyed to the widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> of the late  Mr Joshua. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, my <span class="highlight">family</span> was connected with the Victorian State Parliament at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view assistance to the full amount of contributions for standard hospital and medical coverage should be provided by the Commonwealth Government to the head of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two dependent children where the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, exclusive of child endowment, for a defined period, does not exceed the minimum wage payable under Commonwealth awards or the State in which they reside (with appropriate adjustment for assets). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly where there are more than two dependent children in the <span class="highlight">family</span> the amount should be increased by $4 for each additional child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">family</span> weekly contribution would be 70c which returns a total benefit of $10.40. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medical benefits and public ward hospital benefits in Victoria are expected to cost a <span class="highlight">family</span> $1.46 weekly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition the person has to decide whether he wants to cover his <span class="highlight">family</span> so far as hospital insurance is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know what it would cost if all persons under a <span class="highlight">family</span> income of $48.50 were to have, in effect, their contributions to a health insurance scheme paid fully for them by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, ls it a fact that an Australian taxpayer is allowed the total costs incurred for medical1 services for himself or his <span class="highlight">family</span> as deductions from his assessable income for tax purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frequently  the whole pattern of their lives - social activities,  holidays,  employment as  well  as ordinary  domestic  duties - have to be  adjusted to meet  the needs of the  son  or  daughter who  cannot become part  of  the  normal  <span class="highlight">family</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objectives of the Commonwealth scheme are twofold: To enable low income dairy farmers who voluntarily wish to do so, to leave the industry and to receive a fair price for their land and improvements; and, after the writing off of redundant assets, to make the land and useful improvements available to other farmers so as to build up their properties to a viable <span class="highlight">family</span> farm level and, where possible, diversifying the pattern of land use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally the scheme reinforces the concept of the single-unit <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as the basis of agriculture in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also have an intimate relationship in the development of <span class="highlight">family</span> life, community life and personal life in a period of Australian history which is changing and which is particularly significant both at home and in our relations abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, the whole of his <span class="highlight">family</span> has accepted parcels of shares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is all tor the  Deputy  Premier of Queensland and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, but it goes much further than that because he is not the only one in the Cabinet who is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: In view of the further statement to this picture, ‘There is only one horror worse than the indignity this woman was suffering: the fact that there are thousands of others with the same problem’, will she bring this matter as one of urgency to the attention of the Minister and request an immediate allocation of funds or any other assistance to the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span>, the St Vincent de Paul organisation and other organisations helping these unfortunates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures I have just given are by way of illustration and are based on afamilyof husband and wife and would vary if the <span class="highlight">family</span> included one or more dependent children, or conisisted of  1  parent and a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further relevant provision is in section 82u(l.)(b) of the National Health Act which excludes pensioners enrolled in the pensioner medical service from low income <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows, if honourable senators have been able to trace these provisions through, that the amendment would affect only a very small number of applicants whose means as assessed are equivalent to between  $47  a week, which is the eligibility ceiling for the pensioner medical service, and $48.50 a week, which is the eligibility ceiling for low income <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, the word does not apply, for instance, if the child is injured in a motor accident, but if the child is born with some affliction - and this is the point that I wish to mention to the Senate - the assistance flows not only to the parents of the child but to the other children who may be within the <span class="highlight">family</span> or, indeed, to the close relatives and people of the particular <span class="highlight">family</span> from which the handicapped child comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that  Senator Fitzgerald  will support me when 1 say that so many of them are still interested long after a member of their own <span class="highlight">family</span> or their own child has passed out of the ambit where they can be assisted or have been assisted to the fullest extent possible and are dedicating themselves to helping others because they have become involved in the problem at (his level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all, it is to enable low income dairy farmers who voluntarily wish to do so to leave the industry and to receive a fair price for their land and improvements: and, secondly, after the writing off of redundant assets, to make the land and useful improvements available to other farmers so that they can build up their properties to a viable <span class="highlight">family</span> farm level and, where possible, diversify the pattern of land use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> unit dairy farmer, unless  he  very soon lakes steps to protect his slums in the industry, is doomed to disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that one thing that has affected many of us in examining this legislation is the uneasy feeling that this may be one of the first measures towards the elimination of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who believes that the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm must be maintained, despite the agricultural experts who say that the key to the future lies in huge collectives such as we see in authoritarian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have believed always that the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm is a way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foremost among them must come those things that are necessary to maintain the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally the scheme reinforces the concept of the single-unit <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as the basis of agriculture in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commodity such as dairy produce is essential, particularly for children, and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man will be asked to pay more not only in prices but also in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The most appealing aspect of the legislation is summed up in the closing paragraph of the Minister’s second reading speech when he said that the scheme reinforces the concept of the single unit <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as the basis of agriculture in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will explain this further when I am replying to  Senator McManus  because he spoke about strengthening <span class="highlight">family</span> farming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, I was delighted to hear the assurance from the Minister for Air  (Senator Drake-Brockman)  a few minutes ago, that the Government is concerned to retain a <span class="highlight">family</span> farm interest in the dairying industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, they seek to impose unfair taxes; taxes which are of an inequitable nature in that they will fall ultimately on the consumers, the <span class="highlight">family</span> men, the people least able to bear them in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a means of meeting one of the problems of the retention of skilled service personnel, will the Minister earnestly consider initiating a scheme in the 3 branches of the service whereby postings of serving members who have families, with the consequent disruption of <span class="highlight">family</span> life, will only be made where another person with similar skills and qualifications and willing and able to accept the posting is not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy President,  this Budget represents social injustice perpetrated by an unfeeling government against those already economically handicapped - the wage earners, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those whose policy is justice for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man will support that policy with their votes there will be enough votes in the Senate to defeat these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The low and middle income earners, especially the <span class="highlight">family</span> men, are hammered by this Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget proposal, against this background of increasing interest rates, is now to increase the taxes on the commodities which comprise the standard of living of the average man and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man has not even been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no mention at all of  a  <span class="highlight">family</span> man who would be paying no taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if she does not use cosmetics, nearly every commodity that that <span class="highlight">family</span> uses will be transported in a vehicle that uses petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one person is paying 50c tax in the $1 the Government says: ‘At the end of the year we will remit to you half of what you pay so that protection for the health of your <span class="highlight">family</span> will cost you S50 this year’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It adds further to the iniquitous situation regarding indirect taxation which hits hardest at the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and imposes a greater percentage penalty on him than on people better able to look after themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at basic wages and at incomes, one normally looks at the <span class="highlight">family</span> as being the average unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, we note that the increase in pension was $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At page 465 of Hansard  Mr Whitlam  incorporated a table, called table 8, which is headed ‘Budget impact on <span class="highlight">Family</span> Income and Spending’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider the increased postal charges which may apply to the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> we find that there is an additional $7 a year in respect of rental charges for a telephone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a <span class="highlight">family</span> would have to write 900 letters a year to make up that amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other increases are some relatively insignificant ones to the average <span class="highlight">family</span> because I do not think many of them send a great number of money orders each year and 1 do not think the average <span class="highlight">family</span> sends a great number of telegrams each year - certainly not enough to make up this difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are all aware of the needs - and 1 mean ‘all’ because there is not a senator who is not conscious of the needs of the individual, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the institution, religious as well as private, in the way of medical and hospital care, educational and institutional requirements, research, guidance clinics, staff training and workshops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, in their hearts, do not expect to see their son again but, nevertheless, this is indicative of the intransigent attitude of this Government to cases involving ordinary human beings that are brought before it, not every day of the week but several times every day of the week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In formulating the Budget, the Gorton Government forgot the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, ignored the chronically ill and insulted the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to survive as a free enterprise democracy the strength and stability of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is fundamental to our very survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strength and security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is perhaps the basic reason why we have, to this stage of our political history, arrived by evolution and not by revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I reiterate these 5 points: The security and strength of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit; the provision of ever greater equality of opportunity; the maintenance of a profit motive within a properly constructed and developed and generous legal system of restraint; a careful attitude to our real understanding of freedom; and a suggestion that we should temper our concern for pure theory with social and political considerations lest we become slaves to ivory towered conceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the fundamental strength and security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is basic to our society in a free enterprise democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this is the Government which talks about the stability of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the <span class="highlight">family</span> being the whole future of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Budget merely plugs holes in social services and makes no provision for a comprehensive national insurance scheme or for necessary aid for <span class="highlight">family</span> life through better child endowment, maternity allowances, housing, health and education assistance; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been nurtured and advanced through the assistance of <span class="highlight">family</span> organisations, particularly in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had seen fit to do something about increasing child endowment instead of reducing the level of personal income taxation on taxpapers in the lower and middle income groups I feel that it would have been more beneficial to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel that an increase of child endowment could have been more beneficial to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before in this chamber, the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is the backbone of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did a doctor take undue liberties with  a  teenage female applicant during a medical examination at Calcutta; if so, have subsequent <span class="highlight">family</span> groups been reluctant to have their daughters examined by this doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference wilh his privacy, <span class="highlight">family</span>, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person most vitally affected is the ordinary Tasmanian consumer, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, who has to bear the brunt of the extra impost not only of increased freight rates but also of increases contained in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, apart from the duty I have to address myself to the chamber in order to present the position of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, 1 can claim some minor entitlement in the other role because of the strong Tasmanian connections of my <span class="highlight">family</span>; my mother and 2 sisters having been born in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The worst aspect of poverty in Australia is that most of it is not caused by some sudden <span class="highlight">family</span> crisis such as illness but rather is inherited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to  Dr Henry  Schoenheimer, for the child of a professional or senior executive <span class="highlight">family</span> the chances of obtaining a tertiary education are 18 times higher than those of a child with semi-skilled or unskilled parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those people who seek to do what society demands - to marry and raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> as early as possible - are at a distinct disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who is married and has a <span class="highlight">family</span> but does not own a home has less chance of obtaining a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In Brisbane today it would be very hard to get a cheap <span class="highlight">family</span> flat for less than $16 to $20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a flat you cannot raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flat owners seem to object  to having as tenants couples who have children, so of necessity a <span class="highlight">family</span> man who does not own a home must rent a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To rent a house in the suburbs in Brisbane would cost from $25 to $30 a week or more, which lessens the ability of a man with a <span class="highlight">family</span> to save sufficient to purchase a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to consider the position of the person who in this community should be the most important - the man with a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the most important single unit within society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> should be assisted in as many ways as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision in this Budget by way of child endowment to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, the Budget increases the taxes which flow indirectly and become a penalty on the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is anticipated that legislation will be introduced to increase receipts duties which will further escalate and inflate the costs of basic requirements for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is of little use to the wife and 3 children of an unemployed man to know that the <span class="highlight">family</span> would be getting more money to meet their needs if the husband was an invalid or a TPI pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is required in Australia in our social service system, simply on the money level, is a determination of the needs of a <span class="highlight">family</span> according to the size and rate of benefit adequate to meet their needs, regardless of whether the breadwinner suffered a setback due to poor seasons or loss of markets in the case of a farmer, or due to unemployment or physical incapacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would apply whether the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> was working or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet good Australians who rear a <span class="highlight">family</span> in an atmosphere that we applaud, in the main, are denied an adjustment of something that has been in operation for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the loss of home and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conformity with the United Nations principle just enunciated, the Government believes that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the cornerstone of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will take what steps are necessary to promote the well being of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It might have been in a position to give the <span class="highlight">family</span> man something more than he has been given in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, and I am sure many more people in Australia, would have been prepared to forgo tax cuts if something realistic had been done in the social services field, particularly with regard to the age pensioner and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who has always been the concern of the Party which I am privileged to lead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us consider the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> man who has a wife and 4 children and receives $60 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is the first <span class="highlight">family</span> man who requires more assistance, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with 4 or 5 children who is on a low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he has not examined the proposed tax because my advisers tell me that it will mean at least an additional 50c per week to the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in increased cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are least happy are the pensioners and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have listened to many honourable senators opposite saying that the <span class="highlight">family</span> man has not had a fair deal from this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me this statement is extraordinary because in the first place the <span class="highlight">family</span> man is surely the man who will benefit from the taxation relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a direct benefit to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all benefits to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again these are benefits to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man will also benefit by the assistance being given to primary and secondary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the invalid pensioner group, is it reasonable that a 16-year-old invalid pensioner would need the same pension as an invalid man with a <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree wholeheartedly with him in what he said about the Government’s approach to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the question of the introduction of a system of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts into the Australian court system receiving any current consideration, and is the system to be introduced in the foreseeable future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question whether a system of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts should be introduced into Australia is of concern to both the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  in condemning this Budget as being a Budget which would appear, on the surface, to be honouring a promise of tax concessions for the lower and middle income groups whereas, in fact, the people who really need the assistance - the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the person on the average wage - will be receiving in the vicinity of $1 a week concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Budget merely plugs holes in social services and makes no provision for a comprehensive national insurance scheme or for  necessary aid for <span class="highlight">family</span> life through better child endowment, maternity allowances, housing, health and education assistance; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from medical and allied costs, however, a person with dependants will invariably have continuing <span class="highlight">family</span> and domestic expenses; accordingly, hospitalisation will not affect the introduction of the higher rate of benefit in such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did Brian Ross answer the questions normally found necessary to ask to establish genuine conscientious beliefs, such as: ‘Would you forcibly stop an invader in your home threatening the female members of your <span class="highlight">family</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are saving perhaps to buy a house, maybe to get married, maybe to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> and educate their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a younger child in the same <span class="highlight">family</span> kindergarten fees for the year amounted lo $72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we deduct from the basic wage the amount of income tax that a basic wage earner would have to pay, the difference between the net amount a pensioner couple receives, together with fringe benefits, and the net amount which a basic wage earner receives after tax and on which he is expected to bring up a young <span class="highlight">family</span> and to accumulate assets to purchase furniture and all the other things that a pensioner couple may not have to purchase at their stage of life- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the basic wage to which  Senator Rae  referred was based on the needs of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit of a man and his wife and their 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit with less than 2 children, including the single man, received a higher income and did somewhat better out of the basic wage which was determined from time to time according to cost of Irving figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> on a low income - even  a  <span class="highlight">family</span> whose breadwinner has had constant work, on a tradesman’s wage with a tow margin- employs its income perhaps in the rearing of 3 or 4 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the rearing of children is expensive, this leaves the <span class="highlight">family</span> nothing to save. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could even come down the list quite a way and regard recreational activities, <span class="highlight">family</span> and child welfare as well as counselling services, as coming within the field of social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> was much larger in those days than it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic circumstances of those days made it practically imperative that, if schooling was available to them, they leave school at the minimum age of 14 years and go out to work in order to supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is in the form of indirect taxation or direct income taxation the burden would fall heavily upon the young people who are about to be married or who are married and are raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>, lt is harmful to have heavy taxation in our developing country if the desire is to have a happy and prosperous <span class="highlight">family</span> unit which is bringing more Australians into the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Chalk  descended to a personal attack and insulted me because I adopted a procedure which my <span class="highlight">family</span> had used for years of normalising the name which my <span class="highlight">family</span> had used in business from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But  Mr Chalk  took me to task on this and accused me of disloyalty to my father and my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a situation today in which young 20-year-olds, very often against their will, are being taken away from their homes and their <span class="highlight">family</span> life, thrown into the Army, conscripted to serve in Vietnam, wounded in action, brought back to Australia and awarded a total and permanent incapacity pension if their case warrants it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The applicant indicated that of the 37.5 per cent station-originated material, 8 per cent of total programme time would relate to news, 8 per cent lo <span class="highlight">family</span> programmes, 6.5 per cent to light entertainment, 4.5  per  cent  to  informational programmes, 4  per  cent to sport, and 2.6 per cent to current affairs, with drama, arts and religion making up the remaining 3.9 per cent.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By far the greatest proportion of programmes in <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time consisted of general entertainment from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although many of these programmes attract the young audience it is clear that in <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time there are unused opportunities for developing a wider range of Australian programmes of both an entertaining and informative character to interest children and adolescents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator will have an opportunity to say whether he wants to help to prevent inflation, whether he wants to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who is affected by this kind of impost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill will fall heavily on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and on businesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doubly unfair because it falls on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man directly in what he purchases and indirectly in the goods and services for which he pays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they really intend to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, as they have often said, I would hope that they would support us in opposing this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing so they would protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, not only from the direct effect of these taxes but also from the indirect effects in that the cost of goods and services which ordinary citizens have to purchase will not be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would find it difficult to understand how any Party which desired to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> man could agree to the imposition of this kind of tax, not only in the field I have mentioned but also in respect of all the other items which are affected by increases in sales tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government wanted to do something to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> man it would have had a look at the taxation remissions which are allowed such as the amounts which one may claim for dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From a revision of the scale and of the allowable deductions for dependants the <span class="highlight">family</span> man would have received considerable assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have plenty of examples, 3 think, of cases where people have received such assistance on the occasion of returning to Australia but  Mr Bould,  who was an ordinary worker in the community and a valuable’ asset to this country, has now placed himself 1,000 or more in debt in order to bring his <span class="highlight">family</span> back to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As you know,  Mr Deputy President,  the Party which I am privileged to lead has been a strong advocate for generous payments under the heading of child endowment because we believe the <span class="highlight">family</span> man is bearing a burden out of proportion to what he should be bearing today because of increased costs of living and because of the relatively poor position that he is in compared with his married fellow worker with no <span class="highlight">family</span> or the single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By putting <span class="highlight">family</span> units into the environment in which it is now putting people, it will create in Victoria in 50 years time the type of Harlem slums that exist in New York today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By spending about the same amount of money on taking those people out to suburban blocks to live in an environment in which <span class="highlight">family</span> life can develop in much more congenial circumstances, an additional 400 homes could be made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most people in the low income groups are unable to meet their <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments and, at the same time, pay high rentals or, if they are successful in saving the necessary deposit, home purchase instalments under the most favourable conditions which they can find. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that much more can be done, not only in the provision of housing finance but in all directions in the housing field by the Federal and State governments to protect the Australian people and particularly the man on the low income who is saving desperately to provide a roof over his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we get to the situation where a British subject born in England and of European race has married an Indian lass and is denied an assisted passage to this country because one or more of his <span class="highlight">family</span> are ineligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a disgraceful situation when, because he chose somebody he desired to spend the rest of his life with and because he chose to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> and bring young children into this community, the Government says ‘No’ because the colour of his wife’s skin is different, and because the colour of his children’s skin will be different, from the colour of his own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result has been that serious financial embarrassment has occurred to the inmate and his or her <span class="highlight">family</span> and there seems to be no reason in the administration of this section for the removal of those persons, in many cases without any medical examination whatever or, in some cases, a visit from  a  doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After all, it is Commonwealth public servants’ money, and 1 understand that the policy of the Commonwealth Superannuation Board - the Minister can correct me if I am wrong - is not to advance loans from the Superannuation Fund to public servants who are anxious to secure loans at a reasonable rate of interest for the purchase or the construction of a home or for other purposes connected with their <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disruption of <span class="highlight">family</span> life, including children’s schooling, which these practices cause is a prime element, I believe, in the resignation of Service personnel and failure to re-engage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only new consideration which the Opposition considers would be satisfactory is the need to look at the whole question of the Services, including the social environment and the <span class="highlight">family</span> separation which comes from posting, reposting and reestablishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have it on record in the Senate, as well as everywhere else, that rates for skilled personnel are better outside, conditions are better outside and the person has a greater opportunity of promotion and of getting the sort of things which he needs for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the migrant in Commonwealth hostels, the allowance has been such that the normal hostel tariff has been deducted leaving the migrant, if single, a living allowance of $12.15 per week and, if married with a dependent wife, $.15.00 per week with increases according to the number of dependent children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The culpable neglect of the Federal Government in allowing child endowment rates, particularly those for three or more children, and maternity allowances, to deteriorate in real value to such an extent that the <span class="highlight">family</span> obtains no great assistance from the receipt of such payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote a few excerpts from it to show that there is irrefutable evidence, as a result of expert technical investigation, that the large <span class="highlight">family</span> group is one group which is a victim of the current inflation and that it is a group which is providing one of the gross and grave areas of poverty in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A line was drawn arbitrarily at a level equal to $33 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of a man and his wife and 2 children - this was in 1969 - and anything below that line constituted poverty and anything less than 20 per cent above it constituted marginal poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that he could not sustain the general porposition he was making - that the Government has been lacking in that responsibility to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, to young people and to those who are in poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Institute, in that report, assumed that a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a man, his wife, a son aged from 6 to 14 years and a daughter aged under 5 years, with an income equal to the basic wage together with child endowment, was likely to be in poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of the survey it was assumed that an income of $33 a week for such a <span class="highlight">family</span> would not be an unrealistic figure to use as a poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second change I mention occurred in 1964 when the rate for the third child and subsequent children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> was increased by 50c to $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now one finds that a very real benefit is provided for families or for the mother of a large <span class="highlight">family</span> in terms of the remuneration received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are 2 children in the <span class="highlight">family</span> the amount received is a mere $1.50 a week, but when there are 8 children in the <span class="highlight">family</span> the amount received is $14.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are 9 in the <span class="highlight">family</span> it is $17.25 a week, and if there are 10 children it is $20.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1941 when child endowment was introduced the situation was, as the Government said, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit was the cornerstone of national life and the key to our national progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was necessary in the national interest therefore to ensure that some substantial proportion of <span class="highlight">family</span> income was not affected by seasonal or intermittent unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the situation with regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit being a cornerstone of national life and the key. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is a variety of aids, benefits and concessions which are designed to make an easier task of bringing up a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If child endowment was increased by 50c a week in respect of each endowed child according to his place in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, based upon statistics of the people receiving child endowment at 4th January last the cost annually would bc about  SI  01m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following table sets out the current cost of paying a 50c per week increase in respect of each endowed child according to his place in the <span class="highlight">family</span> based on statistics relating to 4 January 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the culpability of the Federal Government in allowing child endowment rates, particularly those for 3 or more children, and maternity allowances, to deteriorate in real value to such an extent that a <span class="highlight">family</span> obtains no great assistance from the receipt of such payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, it is very difficult for them, in view of the affluence in which they live, to understand the situation that confronts the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span>, particularly the <span class="highlight">family</span> with more than 2 or 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hasten to say that although I am not going to support this motion of urgency I very strongly believe in the importance of a vital <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it has assisted the happy <span class="highlight">family</span> and the happy, healthy child in many other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Minister for Health  (Senator Greenwood)  listed some of the things the Government has done to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going into detail because of lack of time but I shall repeat the things this Government has done to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span>, either indirectly or directly, and also to assist children in addition to the child endowment allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has introduced the pharmaceutical benefits which assists the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the child and introduced income tax concessions in respect of children at a total cost to revenue in the year 1967-68 - the latest figure I could obtain - of $266m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tt seems to me that we should be praising the Government for what it is doing, for having such a wide range of interests in respect of which improvements are made regularly for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the children, instead of picking out one item and saying that in this respect the Government has been culpably neglectful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shibboleth of the ‘continental’ Sunday had its roots in the early and mid-Victorian idea that a Frenchman was naturally immoral, the chief evidence of which was that he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> made merry on cream puffs and well watered wine on their one weekly holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We uphold the principle of the importance of church and <span class="highlight">family</span> life, but we have also listened to the pleas on behalf of that heavy percentage of young people who are hostel or flat dwellers and we have recognised that the continually increasing large number of visitors flocking to our national capital must be given due consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In August last year, in dealing with the 1970-71 Budget, I pointed out that the Budget represented social injustice perpetrated by an unfeeling Government against those already economically handicapped - the wage earners, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At one time a person was very fortunate if he went to school beyond the age of 14 and 15 years and the possibility of a university education for anybody who belonged to what might be broadly described as a working class or middle class <span class="highlight">family</span> was almost non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But then the insidious onward march of increased costs, increased interest rates, increased transportation charges and increased problems of living in a rural community caught up with me, swallowed me up, steamrolled me, overcame me despite the fact that I was working from the very early hours of the morning until late at night, as one must do when operating a small <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a gradual taking over of properties and a movement away from those properties of the pioneers who went on to them and cut down the bush, tilled the land, planted and grew crops on it and took it to the point of production before having to move off it because they have been caught up in the passage of time and the economic movements in our society which have shattered any chance they may ever have had of staying on and keeping their <span class="highlight">family</span> together as a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, to take one aspect of <span class="highlight">family</span> life today, the man in the country who wants to give his children a reasonable education comparable with that which is available to people in the urban areas has a problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, he has to suffer his <span class="highlight">family</span> leaving him, and he has to pay board for his children somewhere in the town, he has to pay for them to travel day after day - this surely must affect the capacity of the children to learn - or he has to make some other arrangements for his children to go away from the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are very many reasons - other than money reasons - why a man or a <span class="highlight">family</span> wish to maintain himself or themselves on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics shows that the Bureau estimated that between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the total debt in the wheat and sheep industries is represented by private <span class="highlight">family</span> loans, loans from solicitors’ trust accounts, hire purchase debts and vendor credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I speak as one of many thousands of people in Australia who have <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses, farms or interests in various spheres and whose biggest worry is: ‘How do we continue to carry on with succession and probate duties hanging over us?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne  told us that when this man dies and estate duty is imposed on his estate, his <span class="highlight">family</span> has to sell the property at the market value, not at the potential value, in order to pay the duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every 25 or 30 years in the <span class="highlight">family</span> cycle a <span class="highlight">family</span> just finishes paying its estate duty when the whole vicious circle starts once again and the <span class="highlight">family</span> is unable to carry on with the efficiency with which it would be able to carry on but for this heavy taxation in the form of death duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be an alleviation we on this side would insist that it be given to those people who are suffering, such as the widows to whom  Senator Dame  Ivy Wedgwood referred, the person with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, the woman who is widowed by the untimely death of a young man who has not paid off his house and that type of person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The income of a <span class="highlight">family</span> is probably lower than that of people in a comparable Aboriginal group in Australia- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the State was threatened with the loss of needed income by way of the CommonwealthState financial agreement if it exercised the right to levy an income tax properly based on a capacity of a person to earn an income with the proper type of remissions for responsibilities that are of essential character in our community such as rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can there be any justification for the Government to obtain its revenue through this method of income tax if, in the hazards of business life, one shows a loss and one has to pay a tax because one is participating in community activities for the purposes of trying to make a living for oneself and one’s <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But income tax is based on a different set of principles altogether and it provides proper allowances for those people in the community who are faced with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man who is the most valuable asset that this community has and those young couples who are setting themselves to rear 3, 4 or 5 children will be the people paying the greatest amounts as a result of turnover tax because this tax will reflect in everything that is purchased by these people for the purposes of rearing their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be reflected in food, entertainment and everything that goes .to make up a home and a <span class="highlight">family</span> background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iri most instances a <span class="highlight">family</span> cannot afford to buy cigarettes, beer and those goods that are heavily taxed by excise duty.- But these families still get the whip of the sales tax on exercise books, pencils 1 and other materials needed to send their children to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This last addition happily, perhaps because of the activities of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the firm belief of this Party in the Australian people and the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>, is at present removed from the statutes of both the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no place in the philosophies of people who are fair minded and who at least believe than an opportunity should be given to a man to rear his <span class="highlight">family</span> in a decent way without being taxed beyond his capacity to pay by insidious hidden forms of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first case referred to by  Senator O’Byrne  concerned a young man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> who had been engaged in a business and it was stated by  Senator O’Byrne  that receipts were about $26,500, that assets were about $23,000, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> was still deeply in debt and that the trustee’s remuneration was $1,369. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My time at school was somewhat curtailed by <span class="highlight">family</span> necessity brought about by the tremendous economic stresses of the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The parents of that <span class="highlight">family</span> paid their taxes and then paid for their children to attend school as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us who are interested in children and in their education well know that the educational opportunities of the second, third and fourth child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> were being neglected because of the sheer lack of finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> could not provide the money to continue educating the third, fourth and perhaps the fifth child who might have, been particularly brilliant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the money available to the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle had been spent on educating the older members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rich squatter <span class="highlight">family</span> of one era is sometimes the impoverished <span class="highlight">family</span> in the next, and vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation then is that under the Commonwealth Act the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit - a man, wife and child - receives only 50c more than the rate prescribed in South Australia for a single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> plans its spending and purchasing pattern in relation to daily and weekly commitments on the basis of that earning capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are most concerned that the hardship which is occasioned to the average <span class="highlight">family</span>, which has nothing to spare from the weekly wage, should be allowed to continue because of lack of provision in this Bill to increase the rate of compensation to an amount somewhere near the ordinary wage which Ls earned by a working man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We commend to the Government the suggestion that there should be regular reviews of the rates of compensation and that such rates should be at a level closer to the full wage of the <span class="highlight">family</span> bread-winner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is unnecessary for me to point out that a man who is disabled and who has been denied compensation may find himself in the position, pending the hearing of his appeal, of having no resources at all to sustain himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, so I would urge the Government to take a closer look at these sections and possibly minimise the period during which an appeal should be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing can compensate for injuries suffered, for pain and suffering, for the loss of a breadwinner to a <span class="highlight">family</span> or for the loss of an affectionate father, but as far as possible a court sees that there is no monetary loss to a <span class="highlight">family</span> as a result of someone’s negligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at the present time an injury happens at work and negligence can be proven the court upholds the principle that there should be no monetary loss to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a result of the negligence that happened at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it also true that in a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 8 children endowment is reduced from $57 a week to $46 a. week when the eldest child becomes eligible for the $1.25 a week student allowance, thereby losing $65 a year endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is true, was the reduction taken into consideration when the student endowment scheme was brought in and is this another instance where the Government gives the <span class="highlight">family</span> an increase with one hand and takes more away with the other? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That would be a decision based on a quick assessment, because the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man - the man I have in mind would have 4, 5 or 6 children - on an average rate of pay does not pay tax at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of providing an increase in indirect taxation to cover the cost of these things, the Government is saying to the unfortunate wife or widow who has children and who has to buy pharmaceuticals: ‘Because you are unfortunate enough to have to go to a chemist shop to buy these things for the protection of your <span class="highlight">family</span>, or because you arc silly enough to get sick, you will pay for them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me reduce it to this concept: It concerns the raising

    <p>However, with a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 2 wholly supported children the

    <p>It is quite useless for the Treasurer, who comes from a working class <span class="highlight">family</span>, to

    <p>I note that the payment for children under 16 years in institutions and for each child under the age of 16 years where there are more than  2  children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> will be increased by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When some unusual demand is made on the <span class="highlight">family</span> income there are no reserves to cover it because the <span class="highlight">family</span> has not been able to put away any money for such demands or, as it is commonly known, for a. rainy day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it also true that in a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 8 children endowment is reduced from $57 a week to $46 a week when the eldest child becomes eligible for the $1.25 a week student allowance, thereby losing $65 a’ year endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is true, was the reduction taken into consideration when the student endowment scheme was brought in and is this another instance where the Government gives the <span class="highlight">family</span> an increase with one hand and takes more away with the other? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as a wealthy <span class="highlight">family</span> should help its relatives, friends or even strangers who are not so well off, so should an opulent country help provide money and goods to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that he is quite correct when he says that the amount of child endowment received by a <span class="highlight">family</span> with more than 2 children decreases when the eldest of those children reaches the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly which exists is that the child endowment payments received by a <span class="highlight">family</span> with more than 2 children are reduced when the eldest child attains 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed increase of 50c in child endowment for the third and subsequent children, I believe, creates a worse anomaly as far as the income received from child endowment by a <span class="highlight">family</span> with more than 2 children is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the proposed increase of 50c, the first born child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> will attract a payment of 50c a week, the second child will be paid $1 a week and the third child will now receive $2 a week in child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third child in the <span class="highlight">family</span> becomes the second child for child endowment purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that <span class="highlight">family</span> with only 3 children loses a total of $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parents of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 13 children wrote to me and drew this matter to my attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more children in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, the greater the anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of the children in this <span class="highlight">family</span> of 13 of which I have spoken are students receiving the student’s allowance of $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the total loss to this <span class="highlight">family</span> when the eldest child for child endowment purposes reaches 16 years of age is $8.25 a week because that child loses his child endowment entitlement and receives a student’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, murder is mostly a <span class="highlight">family</span> matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During my early years I grew up with a great number of young criminals because my father thought it was wise that lads without a proper <span class="highlight">family</span> background should be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we tend to get oversentimental about a person who commits a crime and to forget society or the person against whom the crime has been committed, lt always sickens me somewhat that  the moment the death penalty is imposed upon a person who has committed a crime we have people drawing up petitions and “ raising money for an appeal by the criminal, but making no attempt to raise money to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the victim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of child endowment for tho third and each subsequent child under 16 years in a <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be increased by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present child endowment is payable at the rate of 50c per week for the first child under 16 years in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, $1 per week for the second child, and $1.50 for the third child, with cumulative increases of 25c per week for each subsequent child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child endowment is now an accepted feature of <span class="highlight">family</span> income and for some time the Government has been concerned that the larger <span class="highlight">family</span> has been more adversely affected by wage and price increases than the smaller <span class="highlight">family</span> with, say, one or two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wage increases which have to be spread over a greater number of dependants reduce the relative improvement in the position of the whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that at the present time an effective way of providing real benefits to the larger <span class="highlight">family</span> is by way of increased child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the proposal in the Bill before the Senate is to increase endowment for the third and each subsequent child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that the rate- of endowment in respect of the third child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> will become 2 per week, in respect of the fourth child $2.25 per week and so on, increasing by 25c for each additional child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to families through the National Health Act where the <span class="highlight">family</span> insurance rates for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners - the latter being a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these exemplify the attitude of a responsible government, which is to provide benefits in respect of children in a way which will render positive assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, a TPI pensioner with a wife and 2 children, who also receives a service pension, but with no other means, will receive a total <span class="highlight">family</span> increase of $5.12 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told in the Budget Speech that the Government will introduce legislation to increase child endowment by 50c a week for each child under the age of 16 years in excess of  2  in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the increase be restricted to children in excess of  2  in a <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that Canada has proposed a special tax rate but I would prefer that 2 people living on one income have the <span class="highlight">family</span> income regarded as 2 separate incomes for taxation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of people receive this benefit and I think it is grossly unfair that a lawyer, a doctor or a worker in industry who shares his income with his wife should be deprived of access to a means of lowering the incidence of tax on a <span class="highlight">family</span> in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the <span class="highlight">family</span> does not meet the requirements for the grant of assisted passages, approval of their application was withheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his <span class="highlight">family</span>,  including  food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of  unempolyment,  sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Child endowment in respect of children who are in institutions will be increased by 50c and child endowment for each child under the age of 16 years in excess of 2 in a <span class="highlight">family</span> is increased by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourthly, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance provision, including the increase in child endowment payments to the third and subsequent children, represents rejection through the national Parliament of the new doctrine summarised in the slogan ‘Pollution is People’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the presumption on which any <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system is based is that people are important and of intrinsic value and are not merely stepping stones to disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From that it can be seen that the payment of State and other assistance towards the maintenance of a large <span class="highlight">family</span> is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  1941  the full bench of the Arbitration Court said that it could not differentiate between the single worker and the married worker with dependants and recommended that the legislature should introduce some form of child endowment to supplement the income of the married man with a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Theoretically there are many ways in which a <span class="highlight">family</span> within the community may be provided with the normal material means necessary to sustain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In  1941  the Chief Judge of the Court considered that on the basis of needs only the basic wage then operative was sufficient to provide only frugal comfort for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit of  3.  that it offered only a meagre existence for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit of  4,  and that if there were more than  2  children a <span class="highlight">family</span> on the basic wage would experience hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned in my speech on the Budget that in the case of a person who had more than  4  children, when the first child reached the age of  16  years and became eligible for endowment under the student endowment scheme the <span class="highlight">family</span> would lose a certain amount of the child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the table which is part of the Minister’s speech on this Bill one finds that a <span class="highlight">family</span> of  8  would have received  $14.25  a week before the eldest child became eligible for student endowment, but that after the child became eligible for the student endowment the <span class="highlight">family</span> would receive only  $13  a week  - $1.25  a week or about  $65  a year less than had been received previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new scheme a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 8 children under the age of 16 years will receive 17.25 a week, but if the first child becomes eligible for the student’s allowance the amount received will be reduced to $16.25 or, in other words, Si less than the <span class="highlight">family</span> would have received had the child endowment remained and the student’s allowance not been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, child endowment was introduced to supplement the income of the breadwinner with a <span class="highlight">family</span> so that the <span class="highlight">family</span> could improve to some extent its standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Department of Social Services has assured me of the accuracy of the following situation: Under the new rates payable per month of 28 days (a) for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 8 wholly supported children, when the eldest school child turns 16 the endowment cheque drops by $7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the aspect of child endowment I would simply say to  Senator Drury  that it is a fact that when a child turns 16 and receives student endowment the amount received by the <span class="highlight">family</span> in which there are more than 2 children will undoubtedly decrease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1964 the Government introduced the student endowment and that has meant that the young person living with his <span class="highlight">family</span> after he has turned 16, if he is still a student, has gained a benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Scheme will also assist members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of an eligible farmer who have been working full-time on farming other Ulan domestic responsibilities, and who have been primarily dependent on the income of the farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could be said to exist where a perron or a <span class="highlight">family</span> is unable to maintain a standard of living which is generally accepted as adequate by the community in which he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The test which was adopted by Professor Henderson in 1966 proceeded on what he regarded as an acceptable standard of living for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having made provision for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, he assumed that there was a standard of living for a pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> of a man, wife and 2 children, the income equivalent to the poverty line was assumed to be marginally adequate to meet a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s expenses after payment of income tax, but the appropriate poverty line for a pensioner was calculated on the basis of a given percentage of the <span class="highlight">family</span> poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This procedure does not take account of the fact that, unlike <span class="highlight">family</span> income, what a pensioner receives is not subject to taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In general the pensioner does not have to meet medical, hospital or pharmaceutical expenses, as does the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition the pensioner receives other fringe benefits which a <span class="highlight">family</span> do-&gt;- not receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 claim for my Party credit for having influenced the Government to alter the flat rate system of child endowment payments and for granting an increased rate of payment in respect of all children in each <span class="highlight">family</span> after the second child in order to assist big families to get by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With equal pay for the sexes  -  I am not growling about that at all - an unmarried woman without chick or child to maintain will receive the same income as a male, if she is doing the same work as that male; yet that male may be married and have a <span class="highlight">family</span> to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result, when  a  child in  a  <span class="highlight">family</span>  of  3 (or more) children  reaches 16 years and attracts student endowment, the total payment for the <span class="highlight">family</span> will be reduced but even so it remains $1.50 a week higher than it would have been had the Government not introduced student endowment in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was introduced, as was suggested by 2 previous speakers, as a measure supposedly designed to bring in two-thirds of the money required to contribute some supplement to the wages and income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose practically every member of the Senate has received correspondence from people who suffer with chronic illnesses, people who suffer with diabetes, asthmatics, people who suffer with ulcers, who are not eligible for the subsidised medical scheme and who are not pensioners, age or invalid; from people who have <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities or whose kiddies constantly require medical treatment, who might have to obtain a prescription once or twice a week and whose means are comparatively limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Be that as it may, let me say this in relation to the argument that  Senator Cavanagh  has been putting: Because this increase will impose a very heavy burden on a great number of wage and salary earners, having regard to the half empty bottles in their medicine chests it could well be that the health of a large section of the community will suffer because the worker on a limited income and with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, rather than seeing a doctor after having a recurrence of an illness that he had 2 years ago, might well decide to use the contents of that half empty bottle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Science whether he is aware of the pornogr aphic content of the New South Wales University student journal’ Tharunka’, particularly the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Issue’ dated 28th July 1971?Is thetaxpayers’ money being used in the production of Tharunka’ and associated publications such as the notorious ‘Sex Manual’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What reply does the Government make to his criticism that it is actively discouraging <span class="highlight">family</span> planning by levying this tax at the rate of 274 per cent as a luxury item under the amusement tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, therefore, introduce along lines similar to citizenship instruction, education in domestic economics and <span class="highlight">family</span> budgeting for students in their last year of schooling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the views of Professor Wilfred  Mommaerts,  Professor of Physiology and Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, who recently told a seminar in Melbourne that a quiet revolution in medical education is occurring in the United States of America, created by  students concerned with the needs of the under-privileged and who desire to create a modern variation of the old style <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Priority is also being given to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and the movement of personal nominees.In particular, priority will be given to wives and dependent children of breadwinnerswho are already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present rate is not enough -o keep a <span class="highlight">family</span> that finds itself in the situation of temporary unemployment on the standard on which we all would expect an honest, hard working <span class="highlight">family</span> to be kept in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself, without judging the rights or wrongs of whether wives should work - that is their own business - gives a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which both the husband and the wife work much more money to spend and therefore much more money with which to contribute to an inflationary tendency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The loss of a man’s sense of being able to provide for his <span class="highlight">family</span> is something to be witnessed and observed at first hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An average <span class="highlight">family</span> now is better off than in 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the Government’s present assessment of the economy should any social distress be occasioned the Government will be acting to ensure that the individual Australian employee and his <span class="highlight">family</span> will not be suffering unnecessary social distress through temporary economic difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By using the private sector, the <span class="highlight">family</span> has to work excessively to pay the first and second mortgages which are so much part of our society today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the proposed amendment imply that because a woman is a deserted wife, even though she is reasonably well off, she is to be placed within special categories and not dealt with on the same basis as other people with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities who happen to be low income earners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth has the responsibility to look at the people of Australia and to say: ‘We are out to assist the low income earners, particularly the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the Government’s philosophy over the last 20 years we have arrived at a. situation in which the man who most needs assistance for housing is the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with 3, 4, 5 or 6 children, rather than the man who has no <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It pretends that because the <span class="highlight">family</span> man is nol paying very much income tax it is providing him with a great concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not believe that a person should be deprived of the opportunity of benefiting from the education which these colleges provide because he does not have enough money to attend a college, or his parents or his <span class="highlight">family</span> have not enough to send him to a college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few weeks ago some of the members of the Opposition were lauding the statements of an alleged learned professor who had been brought to Australia from the United States of America to tell us we must join the zero population growth movement; that we should not be filth sinners and have more than 2 children to * <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When investigating  Mr Hanley  Woodbridge’s case in Geelong in order to find some kind of precedent or some kind of - method by which I could convince the Minister that this <span class="highlight">family</span> was entitled to further consideration I obtained information about a gentleman working at the ‘ Ford Motor Company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the money that he had to borrow to bring his <span class="highlight">family</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> is here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole <span class="highlight">family</span> should receive the assistance that it is seeking because it will be a very fine <span class="highlight">family</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer briefly to the reply which the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  gave in relation to the case I brought before him of a mixed marriage <span class="highlight">family</span> seeking to obtain an assisted passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man was forced into heavy debt,for the reasons I outlined before, in order to get here to join his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we see cases such as one 1 saw reported in the Press - 1 cannot confirm this because it was a Press report - in which one partner of the marriage, a European, received an assisted passage but not the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been making a plea for the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a European British subject who married a coloured person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a ridiculous, unfair and unmitigated attack on me personally because I am appealing to the humane attitude of the Government on behalf of a particular <span class="highlight">family</span> that the Government itself has already admitted but to which it has refused assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister were in charge of the matter, he would quite obviously admit no parties to mixed marriages because of this terrible fear of murder and rape and all the type of jazz which he has just tried to imply would follow if I were able to get a few bob for a mixed <span class="highlight">family</span> that is coming into this country or is already here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absolutely disgraceful for the Minister to imply that I was doing anything other than attempting to get some assistance for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of mixed marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">family</span> reasons, he had to leave this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case which  Senator Poyser  raised concerned one member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> who, because his birth did not take place in a European country, could not receive assistance to come to Australia where other members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> were living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man had lived in Great Britain for 25 years but because he was born in Colombo - having had no control over where he was born - he could not receive assistance and is now S900 worse off because he has brought his <span class="highlight">family</span> here without Government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second case to which I refer is another one referred to by  Senator Cavanagh,  in this instance involving the Joseph <span class="highlight">family</span> whose relatives in Adelaide had come to Australia on assisted passages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the desire of a <span class="highlight">family</span> is to bring into Australia a relative, the assistance to be afforded to the intending migrant will nol be determined on the colour of the skin of that individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it not a fact that the local general practitioner is the sole person wholly in possession of the total medical history of the patient and of the patient’s <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes it is true - I think ail of us would recognise this - that the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, the general practitioner, usually is in possession of case histories which contain basic information concerning the medical condition of his patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite this the report in ‘The Herald’ referred to  Mr Stanley’s  claim (bat he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> would never have left England if they had known their fate in Melbourne’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring first to Sydney, in Blacktown, which 1 understand is a working class suburb catering for people up to an artisan class and where the development of normal <span class="highlight">family</span> homes is continuing, the price of land in 1969 was $3,300 a block whereas in 1971 it is $6,500 a block. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an example, one case of which I am personally aware and on which I have made representations concerns an Air Force officer who, in order to obtain a home for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, was forced’ to resign from the Air Force so that he could commute part of his Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund entitlement and thus have a deposit for the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the only way in which he could supply a home for his <span class="highlight">family</span> after, I think, 12 years of service in the RAAF. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our amendment will extend eligibility for loans from the War Service Homes Division to allow a member of the permanent forces to construct a home for his <span class="highlight">family</span> and to live in it, and not be forced to resign as happened in the case of the RAAF officer to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have suggested that the War Service Land Settlement Act be amended to permit lessees to introduce members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> as partners in the equity of the holding - sharing the responsibility that would apply in a normal perpetual lease - and that the partners or the dependants of the original war service lessee should have the opportunity of enjoying the same opportunities as would apply to the original lessee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honourable Benjamin Courtice,  a  former senator for the State of Queensland and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his long and .meritorious public service, and tenders its sincere’ sympathy to the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are  Mr Hayden’s  claims accurate that a <span class="highlight">family</span> man in Victoria earning $10,000 a year pays only 60c weekly after claiming his tax deduction for medical and private ward hospital insurance, while a <span class="highlight">family</span> man earning $3,000 a year has to make a net payment after tax deduction of $1.05 weekly for medical and public ward insurance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confirm or deny reports that the existing rates of marginal taxation relief on health insurance funds mean that the effective cost of subscribing to the present top scale hospital and medical benefits table at <span class="highlight">family</span> rates, which amounts to nearly $120 a year, is only slightly more than $90 for the person earning $3,000 a year and, by contrast to show the total injustice, only about $52 for the person earning $12,000 a year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters referred to it which are still unresolved and which are still for consideration are: The elimination of discrimination against Aborigines (including Torres Strait Islanders) by or under Commonwealth and State laws, which is a reference from 7th October 1971; and the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters, which is a reference from 7th December 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we consider that one of them is the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters, I should imagine that we could scarcely find an issue which is in greater need of attention, examination and remedial measures, or which is larger and more comprehensive than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In May 1968 the World Health Organisation recognised the importance of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning to some member nations and in the wider context of general health, lt carried a resolution on the subject, as the honourable senator has pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures have been taken out which indicate that the cost of the increased fares to a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children going to school at the present time will be in the vicinity of $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the proposed new tariff the cost to a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children attending school will bc $63 and for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 6 - there are a number of families like this in the Australian Capital Territory - it will be approximately $126 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that is related to the high cost in the Australian Capital Territory - at least in some areas  -  as has been proved quite conclusively, particularly in respect of the cost of homes, it is conceivable 1 hat there could be conditions of very severe hardship in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, yet that <span class="highlight">family</span> would not come within the $52.50 provision which would mean that it would qualify for a remission of the cost of these bus fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it would be completely unacceptable to an enlightened community if it were to bc suggested that, because a <span class="highlight">family</span>, through economic circumstances, was not able to provide the funds to enable a child to get to school, that child was to be denied for the rest of his life something which otherwise he might have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the nation wide concern over  Mr Snedden’s  revelation that new forms of taxation are under consideration, can the Government give a firm assurance that any re-arrangement of the taxation schedules will not result in increased taxes, either directly or indirectly, for <span class="highlight">family</span> men with working wives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government give consideration to relieving the student or his parents of some of the cost, especially where there are two or more members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> attending a University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these is the number of dependent student children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deduction of $300 is made from the gross <span class="highlight">family</span> income for each dependent child under 16 years of age and for each dependent child (other than the award holder) under the age of 21 who was in full-time education at 30 June of the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, substantial concessions to the means test apply where 2 or more members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> are attending university, advanced education or technical courses as full-time students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken together these provisions can result in payment of higher benefits to a scholarship bolder where other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are also full-time students in approved courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example if the gross income of a <span class="highlight">family</span> whose only child at university is the award holder is $6,000, the living allowance paid at home rates to the award holder is $120 p.a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if a <span class="highlight">family</span> whose gross income is $6,000 have three children at university, one of whom holds a Commonwealth scholarship and the other two hold no awards, then the living allowance paid to the award holder is $546 p.a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two adult classes at the Dorcas Street Primary School, South Melbourne and three classes at the Prahran Primary School as well as two <span class="highlight">family</span> group classes at the Prahran Town Hall were closed towards the end of 1971, as the result in each case of attendance falling and remaining below an acceptable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the <span class="highlight">family</span> group classes at the Prahran Town Hall (where bi-lingual teachers were employed) enrolment had fallen to 7 adults and 6 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternatively I can be driven down by my wife or another member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> and on my re ruin from Canberra, often late at night, 1 will need to have a car waiting for me at Gawler as there is no other means cf conveyance back to my home town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shocking state of affairs is compounded because the Minister for Conservation, Marine and Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland also comes from a grazing <span class="highlight">family</span> in a grazing area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>General, who represents the Minister for Social Services in this chamber, ask the Minister for Social Services to examine the possibility of altering the legislation applying to unemployment benefit so that when a person is out of work he can claim the benefit, irrespective of the income of others in his <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regulation 280 does not refer to prisoners obtaining leave for the welfare of themselves or their <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to be in attendance on his <span class="highlight">family</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on occasions of <span class="highlight">family</span> illness or <span class="highlight">family</span> bereavement; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>283 which, again I emphasise, provides only that, a prisoner may be granted leave of absence to be in attendance on his <span class="highlight">family</span>, amongst other things, for his welfare or the welfare of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision which in the terms quoted by  Senator Cant  says that a prisoner may be granted leave for his welfare or the welfare of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under regulations made in 1970, leave of absence may be granted by the Chief Secretary for specific purposes, and those purposes include employment, <span class="highlight">family</span> bereavement, hospital treatment and attendance on the <span class="highlight">family</span> for certain welfare purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish on behalf of all senators to offer condolences and sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in his sad passing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always had the feeling that he was a man who was devoted to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I think this would be consistent because just as he was very much attached to the Australian Labor Party and all those things in which he was interested, I am sure he would also be deeply attached to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the members of the Lamp <span class="highlight">family</span> were <span class="highlight">family</span> friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has thrown an extra strain on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, particularly on larger families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I could not even say how many cattle have come off our <span class="highlight">family</span> property in the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is sincere about keeping Australian control of our land resources, will it take urgent action against the proposed sale of over 1,200 square miles of the Northern Territory by Gunn Development Pty Ltd, the <span class="highlight">family</span> company of  Sir William  Gunn? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite clear that a need exists in this country for a review of the whole of our law relating to divorce, <span class="highlight">family</span> law and custody of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Government in its education programme consider producing television advertisements advocating that young people should not smoke and time slot such advertisements at children and <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing times, at the same time thereby supporting Australian programme productions for children and <span class="highlight">family</span> viewers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask  Senator McManus  whether he has applied to the Packer <span class="highlight">family</span> to go on its show in order to put his case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he is good to his immediate <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> had an unhappy experience of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a particular day, after having almost despaired of being able to bring his car and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to Tasmania, and after having made an alternative decision to go to Queensland or somewhere else, on the one day 2 of the agencies through which he had been making inquiries said: ‘Bring in your deposit and we will get you on’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 point out that the public company of the Killen <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Northern Australian Development Corporation, was floated with financial support from some of the biggest institutions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An approach was made to the Sunnyside Rest Home in Hobart to have this man admitted, but admission would cost to the <span class="highlight">family</span> $28 a week, and he would not qualify for repatriation assistance while he was in that home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the avenues which were available to this man and to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, namely, an appeal to a board, a tribunal or a commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are building a house alongside him in north Queensland for an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span>, and he is now racing around trying to sell his own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What hypocrisy appears now if this honourable senator, who has been championing the cause of Aborigines, is trying to sell ‘lis house because  Mr Hodges  is deliberately placing an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> next door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have noted the distress caused to individuals when, on the death of the breadwinner in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the survivors must live in an agitated situation not only because of the death of the breadwinner but also because of the very grave strictures of the Commonwealth and State governments on the assets of the estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could quote a dozen cases, as undoubtedly  Senator Negus  could, in which families who have lived on a farm for years have found that when the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has died the demands of both Federal and State estate duty have made it essential to sell part of the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In turn, the company can pay ready cash to  Mr Weeks  to distribute amongst his <span class="highlight">family</span> or in whichever way he wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall from their reading of the report that domiciliary nurses, or people who are engaged in domiciliary nursing, form part of what we call the community health team in which the general practitioner provides the essential continuity to the health care for each individual and <span class="highlight">family</span> whilst domiciliary nurses operating from either a hospital or a community based service ensure that specialised nursing is available in the home when necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly - this reflects something  1  have said once or twice today - the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned can be counselled or helped as to the best way in which it can take advantage of other services provided, perhaps by hospitals, local councils or voluntary agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is conceded that <span class="highlight">family</span> groups - ‘wuntoks’ as they are known - have the right to live on and have whatever may be the property of their own families or tribal groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to understand as an Australian community is that most of these problems arise because of the isolation of the individual from a <span class="highlight">family</span> or, if I may use the phrase, a tribal group, so that in adversity he is incapable of banding together with others and solving his problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a problem of a shattered tribal situation, of a shattered <span class="highlight">family</span> situation, of a people who have no traditions, nothing to fall back on and nothing to belong to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He realises that he is going too far and that his over-indulgence is breaking up his <span class="highlight">family</span> or impairing his health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is widely claimed that a  Mr Kevin  Kent is the Godfather, that a  Mr Joe  Cerutti is the Don and that another member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is  Mr Stan  Sheldon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the accusations being made about these Mafia type people are false - as I have said, one is the Don, another is the Godfather and another is a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span>; they are 3 prominent citizens in Brisbane - I think the public of Queensland should be told, and the person to accept this responsibility is the Minister in charge of racing in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other part of the honourable senator’s question, I am not sure that I am the best person to approach the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which has, as one of the many matters charged to it, the review of the whole question of divorce, <span class="highlight">family</span> law and custody in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that in the early days of the Australian Labor Party, leaders of that Party - men in prominent positions - advocated the prohibition not merely of alcohol but also of tobacco on the ground that the worker was wasting on them money which ought to have been spent on his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rather remarkable factor that we found in our considerations of the Australian evidence - it was pointed out fairly strongly to us - was that a considerable number of young students who indulged in drug taking found, when they reached what we might refer to as a more responsible age, in the twenties, and perhaps because of intentions to marry or because of <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, were able in most cases to give up the drug taking without, as far as they could see, any serious effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although the study showed that 62 per cent of those surveyed took it for headaches or joint pain, 31 per cent took it for such reasons as nerves, tension, ‘out of habit’ or ‘to cope with the <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labour costs for the farmer and his <span class="highlight">family</span> were calculated on the Rural Award of 1947 and a 25/- per week extra calculated as managerial allowance for the farmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I  well remember a great friend of our <span class="highlight">family</span> indicating that he rode through the depression purely on the sale of cream which, in those days, represented about 10s a week for the whole of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may use the term in the totality of the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle of the Senate, in some sense I have sometimes been the fall guy in respect of matters that I put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it is much more desirable to exercise restraint on those who are in receipt of a salary of $11,850 than on the working man who is struggling to bring up a <span class="highlight">family</span> on a much lower wage, or on our pensioners whom we cannot keep in a state of livelihood above the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I recall the 1930s  -  a period which has memorised for me personally and for my <span class="highlight">family</span> - and compare it with today, it seems to me that nobody is giving any consideration at all to the very difficult problems which world events have forced upon nations such as ours in the last 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has always been unfair that primary producers, because they are running a <span class="highlight">family</span> business rather than a company, have to pay off their property during their lifetime and, when they have paid it off, all too often the Commonwealth and State estate duties take a large proportion of these hard earned productive assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lastly, its emphasis is placed on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and it seeks to alleviate his more pressing economic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The DLP hopes that this emphasis will continue in following Budgets because in our view the <span class="highlight">family</span> man is the basis of a sound and healthy Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All too often - perhaps far too often - they get themselves into great difficulties through no fault of their own - through a death in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, illness, accident, or unemployment caused by retrenchment and automation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that the Government in the United States has done that because lt feels that if a man gives people money during his lifetime, especially to members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, they use that money to create employment, perhaps for a deposit on a home or some such purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is shocking to think that I receive letters from members of the rural community who have had death taxes imposed on them because of a death in a <span class="highlight">family</span> and then the <span class="highlight">family</span> is offered financial support by way of the rural reconstruction plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such distances have heightened feelings of loneliness and separation - feelings which can be more acute, particularly for wives and mothers, when ignorance of the English language prevents communication with neighbours, school teachers, shop assistants and others with whom discussions often could result in more efficient and happier <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of $14 a week to families which maintain their senior members in the home is indeed praiseworthy and should provide added incentive to <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previously where one <span class="highlight">family</span> had been raking in income and little country towns were unknown, as a result of the soldier settlement scheme under the Cain Labor Government of the time in Victoria, those properties were cut up and many, many families were placed on them to develop these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As explained in the Budget Speech, these increases in dependants allowances, together with the reductions in income tax proposed by the preceding Bill, are directed to easing the tax burdens of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we have had the situation in which students, part time workers - particularly women who are working to supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income - and young people have been paying tax on their wages which is out of all proportion to their ability to pay, which should be the basis of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At page 13 of the ‘Liberal Platform’ issued by the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party in November 1948 its policy had been amended to read that the adoption of a programme of progressive tax reduction was part of its platform, with special help for the <span class="highlight">family</span> taxpayer, particularly with reference to allowances for dependent children, medical and like expenses, and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I digress for a moment to point out to people who bleat about how much more can be done by the children of aged persons - I am indebted to Dr Klugman, a learned medico in the other place - that since 1955 <span class="highlight">family</span> contributions to national health has virtually trebled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer said, secondly, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, with all his other commitments, is finding that the income tax burden is looming ever larger as a problem and that in relation to his income on the question of fairness, the volume of taxation which he pays, should be re-evaluated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A fully effective programme should both keep up with the growth rate in <span class="highlight">family</span> formation, which is roughly estimated to be of the order of 1,200 new families a year, and overcome the very substantial backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I estimate that for the first time the allocation for 1972-73, taken along with what the States are doing with funds from their own resources, should provide enough houses to keep pace with .the rate of <span class="highlight">family</span> formation amongst those families wishing to occupy houses provided by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I refer specifically to the other part of his question, I think that I should add that inherent in the forms of saving by the community in life assurance is the fact that taxation concessional allowances, which are most important for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, apply in respect of life assurance contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make this brief comment: So far as what my <span class="highlight">family</span> and I have done is concerned, we are rather proud of what we have done; we are proud of our achievements and of our contribution to decentralisation and development where we have been working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I do not think that my <span class="highlight">family</span> or my previous associates would draw much comfort from the observation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the estate is made available, the duty is paid and the assets cease to be frozen there is enough money to provide an adequate living for the widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in many cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Senator Lawrie  as a result of information which has come to him in public hearings of the Committee has been able to give the Senate the benefit of certain inferences that can be drawn as to the effects of the incidence of this duty, the effects of individual cases of hardship which are involved, the general oppression implicit in the imposition of this duty, the economic consequences of it generally and the effect it has on rural industries and on rural settlement, on individual ‘lives, on domestic circumstances and on the breakup of justifiably accumulated <span class="highlight">family</span> estates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That becomes virtually the sole asset of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the sole asset which is passed on in succession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The estate must be sold; the assets have to be distributed; a whole domestic <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is disturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This duty is a tragedy in cases where a breadwinner is suddenly taken away from his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly is this so in the case of the widow with a young <span class="highlight">family</span> who, virtually before she has been able to bury her breadwinner, is beset with the problem of finding finance to pay probate duty and, at the same time, to go ahead with earning revenue to feed and clothe her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said already that it is a tragedy to be involved with an estate and to see the trials and tribulations of a young widow with a young <span class="highlight">family</span> who is trying to overcome the burden of probate duty after her breadwinner passes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One generation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> after another has to pay probate duties and estate duties and each succeeding generation has to start off from scratch again, whereas they should be in the position of being able to expand, if not into land industries, then into the mining industries, and thus develop our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought, especially with a Party such as ours which believes the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is the basis of society, that we would be doing the utmost to preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and not to give charities greater priority than the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Socialists do not necessarily believe in the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters which have deep importance for the retention of society as we know it in Australia and of which we consider the <span class="highlight">family</span> to be the most important unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will encourage people to build up a nest egg for members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> which can be passed on in due time to better the conditions under which they may be living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion to tax that remaining little amount is completely anathema to the spirit of promoting thrift, to a sense of responsibility to one’s <span class="highlight">family</span>, to encouraging the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and to the continuation of -individually owned assets in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I welcome the action of the Government in doubling the exemption amount, particularly in the case of <span class="highlight">family</span> estates, it is a move in the right direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, of course, sees this only as a tax to deprive the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a deceased person of its rightful assets - Labor Party members are always talking about redistribution of wealth - but we see this Bill as a means of protecting the assets of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that some years ago when I was in another place that I had to make representations on behalf of a <span class="highlight">family</span> that was asked to pay an amount of $250,000 on a rural property estate in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently since I came into the Senate a <span class="highlight">family</span> in South Australia was faced with a bill of $175,000 with respect to an estate in a South Australian rural area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This presented the <span class="highlight">family</span> with the problem of having to sell a property in order to pay this amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exemption for primary producers will now rise to $48,000 where the estate passes directly to <span class="highlight">family</span> dependants and close relatives, and to $24,000 where it passes to people outside the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The good honest citizen is one who works for his <span class="highlight">family</span> and in the process of working for his <span class="highlight">family</span> he also works to give his <span class="highlight">family</span> security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That security should not be whittled away when the breadwinner or one of the senior partners of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit suddenly passes from this good world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, living in the same street can be someone who has gone through life without caring about saving - ‘thrift’ was the last word he ever used - and who has made no contribution whatever to his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it is far better for people to pay taxes while they are earning income and are able to pay them than to apply a penalty to their dependants after a senior member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at certain times or in certain circumstances a death in a <span class="highlight">family</span> can have very adverse effects on the dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the death of one of the <span class="highlight">family</span> the shares were valued very highly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Still, the <span class="highlight">family</span> had to pay death duties on the basis of the higher value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased about this because I think gifts are one way in which a person is able to help his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be given the opportunity to pass some of their wealth and hard earned savings to their <span class="highlight">family</span> dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that people should be allowed to do this because, whether the savings be reasonably small or large, all of us place prime importance upon our <span class="highlight">family</span> units and wish to ensure that we leave them secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That cattle station was settled by a <span class="highlight">family</span> from Melbourne 10 years after Burke and Wills perished at the water hole on that station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> built up a complete pastoral enterprise in the centre of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That property was lost to the <span class="highlight">family</span> because the father kept it in his own name despite the fact that he had a large <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of probate and estate duty lost the property to a pioneer <span class="highlight">family</span> which had the fortitude and sheer guts to go up there, settle that country in about 1872 and make a home and a pastoral enterprise out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a lot of cases it has certainly not been in the <span class="highlight">family</span> interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, I would like to see the country built up by people expressing enterprise and by their <span class="highlight">family</span>, if they want to do so, having the chance of carrying on that enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators opposite who have already spoken in the debate have portrayed themselves as being the modern father who want to organise his <span class="highlight">family</span> according to orthodox lines and according to his own values and who finishes up finding that his <span class="highlight">family</span> leaves him because he is not able to adapt himself to the needs of young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This evening I dined with a lass who is attending the Australian National University and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great majority do not accept the responsibilities of adulthood until they have decided to share their lives and to accept the ordinary processes of marriage and rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister take steps to investigate the matter with a view to restoration of <span class="highlight">family</span> financial support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, could the investigation cover the abnormal expenses incurred by deserted husbands or widowers who are in an identical situation of raising a <span class="highlight">family</span> unassisted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will make one comment though: Speaking personally, I do not believe that the situation of the deserted husband is the same as that of the deserted wife where a <span class="highlight">family</span> is involved, although they both have a tremendous problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the 1970 reliefs was to avoid the breaking up of economic <span class="highlight">family</span> holdings through the incidence of estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to increased exemptions from the duty the collection provisions of the law were amended - with application to all estates, not only those of primary producers - to provide most flexible arrangements for the deferment of the payment of duty so as to avoid wherever possible the need to dispose of farms or other <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses to meet estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, a very basic concept of the establishment of the Committee to investigate this question was to relieve the people of this country from the degree of hardship currently thrust upon them at one of the worst periods in the history of a <span class="highlight">family</span>, at the time of the loss of a breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If hardship is the basis on which we are to operate, let us accept the proposition that we look at these things on the basis of the hardship inflicted upon a <span class="highlight">family</span> at this most distressing and difficult period in their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a moral and legal responsibility on every Australian to see not only that he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> live in comfort but also that every other member of the community lives in comfort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can show that serious hardship can result from national service to either the applicant or the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit especially in a farming partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things it supports the application of taxation concessions to minimise the incidence of death duties so as to avoid the necessity for the forced sale of <span class="highlight">family</span> property where the estate is left to the wife and children of the testator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No mention of abolition, no mention of relieving hardship on the widow or the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the testator where death duty is imposed without there being recourse to anything else; merely a mention of minimising the estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third point to be considered is that this woman is a mother with a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While she is prepared to serve the gaol sentence, with all the hardship to her <span class="highlight">family</span> and the like, we are supporting her cause of making a sacrifice in the manner of a heroine on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He accused me in his speech of having come from a privileged <span class="highlight">family</span>, of having a privileged position in life and of having had a privileged education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the numerous previous questions relating to the matter of the introduction in Australia of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 know that over a number of years questions have been raised about the desirability of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and that there have been seminars and discussions in which those interested in the project have been engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts is a matter for the court structure of the various States, although I must qualify that by suggesting that it largely depends upon what a person envisages when he uses the expression ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> courts’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is coincidental that  Senator Rae  should have asked this question because it is my intention to table later this week a paper which has been prepared by an officer of my Department on this whole question of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, with a view to providing information and stimulating public inquiry and discussion of the merits of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This officer undertook a fellowship in the United States of America where he made <span class="highlight">family</span> courts his study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement (that there would be no assurance that the money would be spent on education, it would probably go in “booze”) I feel is a personal insult to each <span class="highlight">family</span> living in the outback.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that this Australian, whose people owned the country before we took it from them, was thrown into gaol for 6 months because he dared to give his <span class="highlight">family</span> a drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to offset the dissolution of stud properties and <span class="highlight">family</span> rural estates to meet probate duties; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of gross income which would ensure that  a  <span class="highlight">family</span> qualified for free medical and hospital treatment under the Australian Labor Party’s health proposals would depend on the amount of concessional deductions allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan, a <span class="highlight">family</span> earning $43.30 per week is already eligible for the full level of assistance and therefore pays no contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In fact a <span class="highlight">family</span> earning $51.50  a  week ($2,678  a  year) or less receives free insurance cover against medical costs and public ward hospital charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Labor Party health proposals, low income earners supporting a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one or more children would be automatically covered at public expense where their taxable income does not exceed $1,700 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I table a paper on <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts in North America’ prepared by  Mr G.  J. F. Yuill, Senior Assistant Secretary (<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law, Bankruptcy and Bills of Exchange), Attorney-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> courts’ is in common use these days as though it had a generally understood meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the persons who use the term have widely differing ideas as to what constitutes a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in indicating just what is in fact involved in some <span class="highlight">family</span> courts that are actually functioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Yuill’s  paper has already been made available by my Department to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to assist that Committee in its consideration of <span class="highlight">family</span> law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view, however, of the considerable public interest in <span class="highlight">family</span> courts that is currently being expressed in many quarters, I have concluded that the desirable course is to make the paper available to all interested persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He states, in paragraph 91, his belief that <span class="highlight">family</span> courts would be a desirable improvement to Australia’s legal system, provided they have an ancillary function of counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the desirability and practicability of establishing <span class="highlight">family</span> courts is a matter that is necessarily involved in the consideration the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs is giving to <span class="highlight">family</span> law reform, it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to make any recommendation to the Government as to whether or not a <span class="highlight">family</span> court or <span class="highlight">family</span> courts should be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this reason the level of fees charged a <span class="highlight">family</span> at each point in time must be left to the judgment of supervisors of centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persons in charge of centres will be required to seek the co-operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling and other local social welfare agencies including those operated by local governing authorities, especially in cases of <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption and where parents or guardians are seeking to place very young children in centres; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One practical application of this proposition will be studies to review how the scheme provided for in this legislation is meeting the needs of the child, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community, and to identify inadequacies, if any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area that will inevitably attract investigation is alternative forms of child day care such as <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in this regard what is the persuasive influence of appropriate <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling on mothers of young children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child care centres have to be seen in their proper perspective; they are supportive of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and in extreme cases are the alternative to placing children in residential institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oh, by the way, would it be against the national interest if I was to raise, say, 6 hogs just for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to eat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> was living together but the husband and wife were incompatible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He left his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> of 3 children but agreed to pay regular maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But such action would conflict with the religious beliefs of this <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the hope of getting some assistance so that the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> could be fed, on 2nd October I wrote to the Minister, but they are still waiting for some assistance in helping them to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should remember that within Australia there are not so many families with different age groups of people within the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have very much a <span class="highlight">family</span> structure of parents and children rather than the other generations which are involved in some other countries of the world in close living conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is provided at 3 levels under this Bill: There is assistance to the child who  will  be cared for in the centre, assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and assistance to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the children of mothers who are unable to care for them or  of  the single male parent who is occupied in earning income for the <span class="highlight">family</span> will need to have  Specialised  care such as we envisage  will  be provided under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government’s approach shows that it places emphasis on the role  of  the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the responsibility  of  the mother to the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not conform with the ideas which we have expressed in relation to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a father who has found no generation gap in his <span class="highlight">family</span> because it was never allowed to develop, 1 shudder when I hear people talk of children under 5 years of age and of the tender age of 3 years being placed in the hands of trained staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may have no ambition to go out to work and if subsidised she might readily take a third child such as a 3-year-old, to share in the love of the <span class="highlight">family</span> for the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no specialised nursing knowledge or anything like that; but there would be love, a <span class="highlight">family</span> atmosphere and personal attention for the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child who has come home from the baby care centre is thrust out of the way while the urgent duties of feeding the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are engaged in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>She has to meet the challenge of the adjustment of personalities within the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many modern appliances to take much of the drudgery out of a woman’s life and to leave her far more time than was available to our parents and grandparents to enjoy the intricacies of <span class="highlight">family</span> life and the wonders of developing new lives and new personalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Democratic Labor Party has always stood for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child who goes to the child care centre for 5 days a week for 8 hours a day, as envisaged in the second reading speech of the Minister, comes home to chaos and confusion, is swept off to bed to sleep, is awakened in the morning to similar chaos and confusion when the <span class="highlight">family</span> is getting off to work, and in the process is dumped somewhere with strangers who do their best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one with any feeling for the child or the <span class="highlight">family</span> could think that there was any possibility of improving the standards of civilisation by taking such a retrogressive step as is envisaged under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would like to see a subsidisation of the child, perhaps in the atmosphere of a <span class="highlight">family</span> circle, rather than what is contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst such an environment may not have the scientific technical perfection of the trained mothercraft nurse, it will at least have the softness of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and <span class="highlight">family</span> background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any child psychiatric expert will tell us today that this is mostly because of neglect in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this neglect in the form of a lack of food, clothing or shelter, or is it neglect of the time necessary to establish proper relationships - a neglect of time in which the child can feel wanted, special and loved in a <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recognised Opposition of this country has abandoned the principle of the <span class="highlight">family</span> society and has endorsed, and indeed not only approved but sponsored, the permissive society that is wrecking the <span class="highlight">family</span> community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mothers are becoming fear stricken at the effects these ideas are having in their <span class="highlight">family</span> circles and they are turning back to what one might call the foolish old-fashioned ideas of people concerned with the <span class="highlight">family</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of maternity allowances, widows’ pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly not that -  pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important factors to emerge from the wide-ranging consultations which the Government has instituted on child care was that the provision of good quality facilities is often an invaluable support to a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures taken by the Government in assisting the community to overcome such problems do in fact provide a number of supports to the <span class="highlight">family</span> such as the counselling service to be provided to parents of children needing care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard from time to time justifications of allowing compensation at a rate which would put the worker or his <span class="highlight">family</span> in exactly the same position as they would have been in but for the injury; the most familiar argument of course is that malingering must be deterred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There the principle has been accepted that not for  26  weeks but during the total period cf incapacity a worker and his <span class="highlight">family</span> are entitled to suffer no financial disability as a result of an unfortunate physical injury which the worker has suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that even though the Government may appear to have recognised the dwindling value of money by raising the widow’s entitlement from  $13,500  to  $14,500,  this approach really misses the point I have been making, that a worker’s <span class="highlight">family</span> should not suffer any penalty because of an injury to the worker whether it be temporary, permanent or fatal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs had before it a reference by the Senate concerning the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters and was in the process of conducting an inquiry by taking evidence from the judiciary, the legal profession, academics and representative organisations; and thirdly, the fact that the Attorney-General himself sat on such committee and would be aware of the complexity, difficulty and variance of opinion on the subject of reviewing the field of matrimonial and <span class="highlight">family</span> law, I ask: Will the Attorney-General suspend the operation of the amended rules, refer the suspended rules to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs when that Committee is reconstituted and defer any further similar action until the Committee has presented a report to the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator will recall it was I who moved that there be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters, with particular regard to oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am assured by the Minister for Social Security that the existing Social Services Act provides that where for any reasons any children, who would otherwise be living together as one <span class="highlight">family</span> or as part of one <span class="highlight">family</span>, are not living together the Director-General of Social Security may, if he thinks fit exercising his discretion, authorise payment of endowment in respect of any of those children- at the rate that would be payable if those children were in fact living together as one <span class="highlight">family</span>, this rate being not less than the rate, that might otherwise be payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Attorney-General received from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association, the Law Council of Australia, the New South Wales Bar Association, the  President  of the Law Institute of Victoria, and other legal bodies and practitioners, representations relating to the confusion inherent in the recent amendments to the Matrimonial Causes rules? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that some of the bodies, including the law graduates, the <span class="highlight">family</span> committee and certain others, particularly in New South Wales, have presented some criticism, mostly directed to the question of costs and mostly inspired by a small group of divorce barristers who have expressed to me personally their very great concern at the ruin that may be caused to their practices by the changes in the divorce rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of her appointment she was with the British Law Commission and was instrumental in the publication of a book on <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Her work in this section led to the passing by the House of Commons of the recent Act relating to <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Act recently came before the English Court of Appeal for construction and the English Court of Appeal headed by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, gave an important historical ruling that the wife in the home is to be treated as being as valuable to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the wife who goes out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to an answer which he gave to  Senator Greenwood  in which he appeared to deny having received any representations about the new matrimonial causes rules from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association, although late in his answer he did indicate that he had received a letter from that body, as I understood his reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Attorney-General be prepared to table whatever document he has received from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee, or whatever it may be called, and will he indicate where in that document the criticism was mostly directed to the question of costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so and as the Government propounds the policy of open government, will the Minister give the full facts as to why this <span class="highlight">family</span> has been granted these financial benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which  is  directed to the Attorney-General, arises out of a question which I asked him earlier today and in answer to which he refused to table in the Senate a document containing representations to him from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the University of Sydney Law Graduates Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of question time on 7th March 1973 - the matter is reported at page 207 of Hansard -  Senator Greenwood  asked the Attorney-General whether he had received from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association, among a number of other bodies, representations relating to the confusion inherent in the recent amendments to the matrimonial causes rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to that question  Senator Murphy  said, first of all, that the answer was no - in other words, that he had not received representations from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee - but that he had received letters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say:  1 must say that some of the bodies, including the law graduates, the <span class="highlight">family</span> committee and certain others, particularly in New South Wales- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that in using the phraseology ‘the law graduates, the <span class="highlight">family</span> committee and certain others’, he was referring to the same body, that is, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association -  have presented some criticism, mostly directed to the question of costs and mostly inspired by a small group of divorce barristers who have expressed to me personally their very great concern at the ruin that may be caused to their practices by the changes in the divorce rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that purports to be a summary of the basic criticism that was levelled at the rules by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association, I submit to the Senate - I propose to endeavour to establish my case by using material in my possession - that that summary represents a gross distortion of the representations which were made by that body to the AttorneyGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span>, Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates’ Association has carefully considered these rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For several years now we have proposed far-reaching reforms in <span class="highlight">family</span> law such as the creation of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, the simplification of maintenance and divorce procedures and above all the introduction of a divorce system based on the fact that the marriage has broken down and not on whether either party was at fault for such breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee had before it  Senator Murphy’s  resolution that it examine the law relating to divorce, custody, and <span class="highlight">family</span> mutters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strong criticism comes from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also it is sorting out the problems of custody, access, maintenance, settlement of property and all the other consequences of the breakdown of a marriage and the breakup of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the 2 parties are in court at arms length lighting about who slapped whom on such and such a day, or who slept with somebody else, whereas what they are really arguing about -the real contest between them - is who is to get the <span class="highlight">family</span> house or who is to get the BHP shares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then we hear this nit picking about the drafting of the rules and someone comes along with a Press report of a statement by the <span class="highlight">family</span> law graduates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> law graduates have an opinion and the opinion has been expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An instance is given of an unemployed standard <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a man, his wife, one daughter 6 to IS years and one male student 16 to 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that <span class="highlight">family</span> the poverty line has been drawn at $58.74 and the present Government proposes a payment of $48.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how proud honourable senators on the Government side may be in pointing out what has been done, this <span class="highlight">family</span> is still $10.24 below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the previous Government was remiss in paying an amount below the poverty line to that type of <span class="highlight">family</span>, I hope that this Labor Government will show more sympathy and meet that difficult situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said that even with the increases, we were still providing a pension rate for a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> that is below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall cite the figures for a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> before the change of government and compare them with the position that will exist under the new Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  referred to the standard <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A standard <span class="highlight">family</span> consists of a man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means, in effect, that the existing rates as determined by the previous Government provided a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> with a handsome income that was $27.24 below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all like to think that our own <span class="highlight">family</span> circle is immune from these pressures and that those in it would not be corrupted by anything at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action of the Government in making the repeal of these discriminatory provisions one of its first legislative acts is a token of our determination to banish racial discrimination within our community and is also a step towards building on equal terms the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation in citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had the situation in the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> for the last 500 or 600 years where the King or Queen could become of age at the age of 18 and exercise all powers of the monarchy, so I suppose it is only right that at last the peasantry or the lower orders or non-royalty should reach equality with the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>19th Street, Narrabundah, Australian Capital Territory, a naturalized Australian citizen, do solemnly and sincerely declare that at approximately 3.25 a.m. on Sunday morning, 18th March, 1973, a number of plain clothed policemen woke my <span class="highlight">family</span> and myself by knocking and kicking at the door of my house at the above address. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recommendations by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney University Law Graduates Association described discretion statements as ‘much criticised by both judges and the legal profession’ and recommended ‘urgent action’ for their abolition, asserting: Their abolition can take place without alteration to the present law’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee has said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">family</span> breaks up the money should go to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and particularly to the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there are positive steps which ought to be taken and they can be taken through this national Parliament to try to preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steps ought to be taken to see that we start to enhance the factors that will preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">family</span> is broken up or when there is a divorce, at least let us enable those people concerned to solve their differences in a decent, humane and dignified way and without their being subjected to this kind of expense which is ruinous to them and which reflects on and injures the prospects of maintenance and advancement of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone who participated said that the Act was not a divorce act; it was a matrimonial causes Act and its supreme aim was to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is wrong that a law which sees itself as a Matrimonial Causes Act, which sees as its supreme duty the protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, should have rules made under it which allow a divorce to happen and then, in its own time, deals with all these vastly important things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he has attacked the <span class="highlight">family</span> and weakened the position of children in the broken <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it is the supreme duty of the court to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> and that supreme duty has been destroyed by the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, he has attacked through costs the weakest member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> - the wife - and this is an outrageous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were I would be at some pains to join issue with  Senator Carrick  who asserted that the purpose of such an Act is to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean that I am not in favour of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is something which is probably beyond the reach of governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer particularly to the evidence of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee of the Sydney Law Graduates Association to which  Senator Murphy  has referred in other respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 note that on 7th December 1971 the Senate gave to that Committee a reference entitled ‘The law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore before asking my question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate I would like to say how pleased I am, as are all senators, at the happy event which occurred in his <span class="highlight">family</span> in Sydney at the weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In spite of the joyous <span class="highlight">family</span> event and the heavy political duty undertaken by him in recent days, was the Minister able to relax on Saturday night and view the Australian Broadcasting Commission program ‘Four Corners’ and listen to his colleague  Senator Georges,  who appeared prominently and for such a considerable time that 1 understand that in ABC and media circles the program is known as the Georges Four Corners program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the form NH5 entitled ‘Application for Approval for Nursing Home Benefit Purposes’ call upon a doctor to state specifically his diagnosis and prescribed treatment and to indicate the degree of mobility and incontinence of a patient, the care required and the general <span class="highlight">family</span> situation of the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes - except for the general <span class="highlight">family</span> situation on which information is supplied by the patient or his relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under these amendments, a widow will not have to prove dependency if she was living with the employee on a bona fide domestic basis at the date of his death and, for this purpose, she will qualify if she was only temporarily living apart from him, perhaps because he was in hospital or she was merely temporarily away from the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Emphasis is placed on our role through the Bank and on the important field of assistance to Papua New Guinea to enable it to become not only a worthy nation in the <span class="highlight">family</span> of nations but also a very friendly and acceptable neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The smaller and middle level property owner such as the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer just cannot afford the elaborate schemes for avoiding estate duty which are open to wealthier citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me state a common instance of how estate duties have become punitive and oppressive for the small <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the beneficiaries of such a small estate are a widow with or without dependent children (although the hardships in the latter case are multiplied) the delays resulting from the existence of death duties can cause considerable hardship since the <span class="highlight">family</span> assets - such as savings bank deposits - can generally not be touched while the only source of income has suddenly been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of estate duties falls on the smaller property owner - the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer - who is in the greatest need of his small savings built up by sheer hard work over a generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, this tax has turned into an attack on the rural community and especially on the small <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer who is the backbone of country life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 2] April 1973 of the Right Honourable  Sir Arthur  Fadden, G.C.M.G., a member of the House of Representatives far the Division of Darling Downs from 1936 to 1949 and for the division of Mcpherson from 1949 to 1958, for many years Leader of the Australian Country Party, a former Minister of the Crown, Prime Minister of Australia in 1941 and Leader of the Opposition betweeen 1941 and 1943, places on record its appreciation of his long and distinguished public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bank refused to lend the money at 7i per cent or 8 per cent per annum, but it said to this <span class="highlight">family</span>: ‘Go to our hire purchase company around the corner and you can have all the money that you want at 131 per cent per annum to build your house’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be a matter for each college of advanced education to determine who shall receive assistance, but I would expect that the grants would be made available to students who are in extremely difficult financial circumstances following misfortune outside their control, such as death, injury, serious illness or desertion by bread-winners of families on ordinary incomes; the annihilation of <span class="highlight">family</span> income in flood, drought or bushfire; seasonal or chronic unemployment of the bread-winner; loss of earning power by the bread-winner or any other reason; unreasonable refusal of financial support by parents; and to the children of age, invalid or widow pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to their repatriation approval on 5th December 1972 the <span class="highlight">family</span> had assumed a situation of chronic dependency, with medical conditions as contributory factors, and the Department considered in all the circumstances that the <span class="highlight">family</span> would benefit if they were returned to the United Kingdom where their relatives and friends could be of assistance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all firmly believe in the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the last thing we would want to do is to pull the rug from under it; but after much thought we have come to the conclusion that this argument does not stand up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that in this field at least the law is useless as a strengthener of <span class="highlight">family</span> ties, and indeed by the friction it causes between the generations may well help to wear them through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the way for an Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> to behave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the reunion of immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if today we take into consideration the indirect benefits that flow through State and local government instrumentalities to the Australian people, the average <span class="highlight">family</span> receives back in services and handouts about the equivalent of the average weekly wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never related wages to productivity, which is something that it must do if it is to protect the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> or the ordinary wage earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be borne in mind that today a <span class="highlight">family</span>, which includes a man, his wife and dependent children, is covered by one annual payment of something like $110, which is reduced to $80 or $75 a year once it is claimed as a tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will apply to whoever in the <span class="highlight">family</span> is working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to families in which the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner (exclusive of any overtime and child endowment payments) does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as denned in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the <span class="highlight">family</span> includes more than two children, this will be increased by $2 per week for each child after the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement also provides that each State will ensure that the number of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings allocated by its housing authority to families who satisfy the needs test shall not be less than the total number of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built with our advances that become available during the year for allocation for the first time, and 25 per cent of the number of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings constructed by the States with financial assistance under this and previous Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements that become available during the year for reallocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the proposed agreement up to  30  per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built by housing authorities with our advances may be sold at a fair price to families who satisfy the needs test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have from the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  a proposal that there is considerable wisdom in trying to settle this matter in the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the States and the Commonwealth without having a public brawl by trying to shove the Bill through immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The population, as we all appreciate, will not develop naturally because of the circumstances of <span class="highlight">family</span> life which have changed so much from what they were in the first stage of our development and since the major period of the massive development of the United States when that country had an immigration rate similar to the one we might be running now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The branch office concerned will arrange tickets and bookings for the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned and the balance of the moneys remaining after tickets have been purchased can be used to assist with the cost of furniture removal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an alternative to this, an approved applicant can pay the cost involved in removing his <span class="highlight">family</span>, and furniture and present his receipts on arrival in Whyalla and be reimbursed under this agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of this clause, the Housing Authority of a State shall not sell more than 30 per centum of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings for the provision of which Housing Authority advances have been used and which are completed or purchased during the period of five years- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> has lived in a housing commission home in a certain suburb of one of our principal cities for 4 years, 5 years or 6 years; if the children of that <span class="highlight">family</span> have grown up in the companionship of neighbouring children; if that <span class="highlight">family</span> has reached the stage at which it may wish to venture into home ownership, it should not be mandatory upon that <span class="highlight">family</span> to pull up its roots from that district and move somewhere else in order to buy a home because the law makes it impossible for that <span class="highlight">family</span> to buy the dwelling in which it has been living for several years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State housing authorities could be powerless to sell a home to a person whose <span class="highlight">family</span> has been living in that home for 4 years, 5 years or 6 years because the 30 per cent of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built by the State housing authority had been absorbed already in sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not think that this is a question on which we should ignore what this Government is prepared to do for housing in other areas, but we urge upon the Government the absolute necessity for it, because of the restrictions that may creep into home ownership in this area, to redouble its efforts to make money available in other areas for the purchase of homes by those people who are prepared to accept the responsibility, which is better from the point of view of the nation, of owning their own homes, and so achieve a better way of life and enjoy a greater potential for a successful <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so important not only to the parents and children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> but also to any government which may need to meet commitments arising from those problems which can develop out of bad <span class="highlight">family</span> backgrounds and which can flow very often from the simple fact that people do not have the opportunity to own their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of  this clause, the Housing Authority of a State shall not sell more than 30 per centum of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings for the provision of which Housing Authority advances have been used and which are completed  or  purchased during the period of 5 years commencing  on  the first day  of  January 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, a <span class="highlight">family</span> that qualifies as a housing commission tenant should be able, if it wishes, to buy the home in which it lives instead of frittering away its income by making payments in rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most difficult <span class="highlight">family</span> to house is a married man on a tow income with a large <span class="highlight">family</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who cannot purchase homes, those who have not the deposit to purchase a home, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man on a low income with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, are among those 93,000 seeking homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of this clause, the Housing Authority of a State shall not sell more than 30 per centum of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings for the provision  of which housing authority advances have been used and which are completed or purchased during the period of five years commencing on the first day of January 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in that case the <span class="highlight">family</span> would be receiving $37.55 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a situation which will seriously and adversely affect his personal life and his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s life, and make his recovery more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us speak from experience and association in this field and we know that in deciding to accept Australian citizenship a migrant takes into account personal reasons, <span class="highlight">family</span> reasons, employment situations; he looks at the geographical influences and he takes very strong cognisance of the state and political factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is pertinent to refer to a statement made by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  that the first priority -would be given to the reunion of immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members - husband, wife, parents and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the present Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> is aware of evolutionary changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only by recognising the ordinary human trait in the <span class="highlight">family</span> that in ordinary circumstances we realise that we have a somewhat more positive nexus with these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If either of those situations were to arise in this case, although it is 1973, does anyone imagine that some indication that the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> was displeased with the supposed arrogance of the Prime Minister would not have percolated from Buckingham Palace to the British Government and even back to the Opposition in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to indicate on behalf of the Government - and, I take it, on behalf of all honourable senators - our deep sympathy to the Governor-General and members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that a message of sympathy be sent to the Governor-General and his <span class="highlight">family</span> by you,  Mr President,  on behalf of all honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine the plight of a man who wants to take his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> on annual leave when it costs $57 for each of them to get only as far as Cairns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the public interest - the protection of public services, the provision of supplies of fuel, electricity, gas, transport, the maintenance of employment opportunities, the security of a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s takehome pay and the effective functioning of our complex and interdependent society with which government ought to be primarily concerned in any industrial legislation it promotes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seem to forget that if another job means that a <span class="highlight">family</span> in Collingwood or Bankstown has to be uprooted and to go somewhere else in this society the breadwinner wants adequate severance pay and sometimes needs it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may speak in broad terms, not only have they a significance from a scientific point of view as descendants of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the dinosaur type, which is of special interest to the world, but also they are extremely important to the ecology of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to think that this Government or any government in Australia would see the whole question of women, their opportunities, the facilities for them to fulfil their professional careers and the ideal way in which the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure should be protected, as part of a whole national institution and not one in which a single Bill is sought to give a discriminatory benefit only to those women who are Commonwealth Government employees and then to have, as a rider to that, the fact that the Government would intervene if this principle were to be introduced in the ordinary, commercial sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been calculated - J think quite effectively and accurately - that a 35-hour week would add $800 to the yearly bill of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some families the wife works 40 hours a week and the husband works 40 hours a week just to keep the <span class="highlight">family</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable senators will agree with me when I say that one’s mother or father deserves definite consideration, but if they have passed on I believe that a single member of Parliament should be able to nominate a person in his <span class="highlight">family</span> to be his dependant, as it were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a member who has spent many years in Parliament deserves consideration in this regard and that he should be able to nominate a person in his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This example could be the case where one <span class="highlight">family</span> bought the shares of their relatives who held just over 50 per cent of the shareholdings, and the relatives bought shares in other companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourteen of the requests have a compassionate basis associated with <span class="highlight">family</span> problems, one request is based on financial loss occasioned by a long standing commitment while 3 of the requests are based on political andhealth reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 22 of these cases the granting of leave is in no way connected with the French nuclear tests and would be normal for any unexpected deployment of a ship (14 are for compassionate reasons and  8  for <span class="highlight">family</span> financial reasons). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 8 July 1 973 of Arthur Augustus Calwell, a member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council, a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Melbourne from 1 940 to 1 972, a Minister of the Crown from 1943 to 1949, Deputy Leader of the Opposition from1951 to 1960 and Leader of the Opposition from 1960 to 1967, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the measure of his success not only as a national figure but also as a man is that he has been so well loved by his <span class="highlight">family</span>- that was evident- and also by those in politics and by the country at large for the great things he did, whether successful or unsuccessful, and for the efforts which he made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a document designed to give to everyone, irrespective of the means or the income of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, an equal opportunity to the educational facilities which are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It involved a <span class="highlight">family</span> of highly intelligent young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three highly intelligent members of that <span class="highlight">family</span> might have been denied the opportunity to fulfil their intellectual capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thank God, as a consequence of the Karmel report and the actions of the Government of which I am so happy to be a member, the opportunity will be provided for the members of that <span class="highlight">family</span> to be educated, to go to university and to follow the course that they want to take in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countless thousands of Australians who have had the intellectual capacity must have been placed in this situation in the past because the income earner in the <span class="highlight">family</span> has not brought in sufficient money to allow his children to be educated to the highest level possible according to their capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have gone without so many things so that that member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> could have the opportunity that the others were denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However hard such an attitude may seem in a particular case - an honourable senator in such a case would want to pay any price if his own children or members of his own <span class="highlight">family</span> were involved - nevertheless in the general public interest, as with cases of kidnapping, the law ought to be as strong as it can be that no one should be permitted to pay any ransom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know people in the Dutch community who suffered not merely nostalgia but the much deeper feeling that to obtain Australian citizenship they had to deplore, more or less in a general sense, that at one time they had owed allegiance to the Dutch royal <span class="highlight">family</span> and to the then Queen Wilhelmina and all that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not have to go back so far- only to the previous debate- to recall that  Senator Davidson’s  clarion call then was that the terminology used referred to the Australian Constitution and he virtually interpreted it to mean that we had submerged any reference to the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the real threat to consumer purchasing power is inflation, and consumers, who are basically the working man and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, can only gain by measures that are taken to slow down the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is on the road to solving unemployment and we are now by our fiscal measures setting out to solve the problem of inflation which, as I have said, not only is a problem in Australia but also is an international problem which basically affects the working man and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase in the interest rates on government securities will encourage more savings  on  the part of the worker and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and thus reduce the rush to spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well to remind the Senate that we are debating an urgency motion brought forward by the Opposition because of its very great apprehension that the actions taken last weekend by the Labor Government, ostensibly in an antiinflationary way, will in fact do great future damage to the whole Australian community and, notably, to the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The deception out of the policy speech that the Budget would contain increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances continued to within 3 or 4 weeks of the Budget, but the Budget disowned it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easier, better, more payable and more secure in Australia to work for the Government than to chance your arm and take the risk of working for yourself or in private enterprise to build something for yourself and your <span class="highlight">family</span> and, in the process, build a bigger and better country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What about the <span class="highlight">family</span> concessions about which we have heard so much from the honourable senators opposite? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will affect city dwellers, rural people and all those who purchase the inescapable food part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget at this increased cost which is due to Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are essential at this stage for the participation which is already involved and the numbers of pre-school age children and young school age children whose mothers are working mothers and who need the assistance of child care centres to combine their domestic and <span class="highlight">family</span> reponsibilities with that of their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to the Australian community that the development of child care centres be a program which protects the strength of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and gives the children of the working mother an opportunity to develop at all stages of their emotional and educational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Crean ‘s Budget was rather like a stern father confiscating a bag of sweets from his adolescent son, and telling him to grow up and learn to eat the same food as everyone else in the <span class="highlight">family</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every honourable senator knows damn well that if his own doctor told him that he should take drug A that is the drug he would take without waiting for a Government medical officer who has not even seen him, has not seen his <span class="highlight">family</span> and does not know anything about his history to write and say: ‘Yes, he can have that drug’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is guilty, by its own deliberate actions, of adding a minimum of $40 a month to the cost that an ordinary low wage <span class="highlight">family</span> has to meet without their having the ability to buy a thing for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rates payable by the worker who is seeking to purchase land on which to build a house for his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> are fixed on the unimproved capital value of the land which in turn is based on comparable sales that have taken place in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government reminds me of a young fellow who inherits from his <span class="highlight">family</span> a very sound business proposition which for years has been properly conducted, which has reserves behind it and which is a viable proposition and who says: ‘Now that I have it I will begin to spend’ and ignores the bases from which wealth has been generated in that business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that 70 per cent of these people are living alone, 87 per cent either own or have access to a refrigerator, 38 per cent are able to do some shopping for themselves and there is quite a large number where the <span class="highlight">family</span> contact pattern is not evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are finding that in many areas of large cities children are becoming socially deprived not because of the income that is coming into the <span class="highlight">family</span> but because of the fact that parents are becoming particularly busy in their own workaday world and children are being left to fend very much for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, quite clearly, in that Declaration and in the philosophy of the Opposition it is implied that the right must be real and not theoretical and that, therefore, it is the duty of government to ensure that if a student desires, or his parents desire him, to attend a non-government school lack of finance in the <span class="highlight">family</span> will not preclude attendance at the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Farming has become more mechanised today and is now not so much a labour intensive industry or one which is reliant on the labour which can be provided by a farmer’s <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The public should understand that it does so at a time when, by a variety of measures including many savage measures, it seeks to cut back, and is in fact succeeding in cutting back, the private sector of the community and the expenditure of every <span class="highlight">family</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a government which believes that at a time of record inflation it is good for the Government to increase its spending but bad for the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today every <span class="highlight">family</span> which seeks to buy a home and finds that it cannot do so because loans for building have fallen some 20 per cent or more, because the money is not there, or because the costs are too high, must understand that this situation has been deliberately contrived by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own <span class="highlight">family</span> has had particular problems in its dealings with one particular Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One night I was at a reception with my brother and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One honourable senator has recently become connected with this art, through the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: How many meetings of the Committee have been held this year for the purpose of considering the reference by the Senate on 7 December 1971, namely, the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can be dealt with adequately only by a Commission fully in touch with the effects on the student, his <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community of education policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Rae  will be aware this provides under the amendment which was carried in 1946 that the Australian Government is able to make provision for benefits to students and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incomes are high, and there may be 2 cars in the <span class="highlight">family</span>; there are swimming pools in many homes, and there are trips overseas, particularly for young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be shown very easily that where someone who is suffering from diseases which this Bill encompasses is motivated back into normal civilian life it is of great benefit not only to the community and the country but also to the <span class="highlight">family</span> to which those formerly sick persons belong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the honourable senator will agree with me that there are many working class people who have quite clever sons and daughters who go to their sixth year level of secondary education and who, unfortunately, because of the financial circumstances of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, often are barred from going on to higher tertiary level examinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full allowance was payable where the adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income did not exceed $4,200 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate to me the justification for absolving tertiary education assistance of any requirement as to merit or age and then tell me whether I am correct in understanding that this assistance is to be distinguished from a scholarship by there being no basic allowance, and that tertiary education assistance consists simply of a living allowance which, of course, in the case of a 40-year-old who has a <span class="highlight">family</span> of four may be a very considerable sum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 November of this year of the honourable John Johnstone Dedman, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Corio from 1940 to 1949, and a Minister of the Crown from 1941 to 1949, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I associate the Opposition with the words of the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  and his message of condolence to  Mrs Dedman  and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to associate my Party and myself with the motion of condolence, and I extend sympathy to  Mrs Dedman  and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to pay a tribute to the dedicated service that he gave to his fellow men and to the nation, and to express my very deep sympathy to his widow and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The focus should be on the child as a total person, living in a. <span class="highlight">family</span> and a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This ought to be sufficient for over 1,100 houses, which would roughly equal what we believe to be the annual rate of <span class="highlight">family</span> formation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government established a special study group of Commonwealth and States health authorities which recommended a co-ordinated program covering establishment of local health committees, delivery of health care- including much wider deployment of doctors and community health nurses- administrative reorganisation, education, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, research and other special programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What will be the scale of weekly charges for (a) a single person; (b) a <span class="highlight">family</span>; and(c) widows’ providers after the death of the spouse who have been paying under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(This is in the context that a <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a man, wife and one child and earning the minimum wage (currently $60.10 a week) should not be liable to pay the levy; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The levy will be charged on taxable incomes and accordingly it will be the level of this income, rather than one ‘s marital or <span class="highlight">family</span> status that will determine the level of contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has to be said- the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ says it on page 1 of this morning’s issue- that 55 companies with which the Barton <span class="highlight">family</span> was associated in New South Wales have collapsed and $2 5 m of money invested by the public has been lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been indicated in Press reports that the <span class="highlight">family</span> does not intend to come back to this country to face the music. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr McCaw  has not answered, nor has  Mr Ryan  answered, the very serious charge that  Mr Pengelly  has made in the statutory declaration, and this is that section 40 sub-section 5 of the Companies Act of New South Wales was breached by the companies associated with the Barton <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could be cases of <span class="highlight">family</span> illness and <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibility which may well have to be taken into account in determining some cases as against other cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always thought that a lesser rate was imposed on private companies because they were generally conceded to be those smaller <span class="highlight">family</span> organisations in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overall, aged people will pay less tax than a young couple which is bringing up children and which is earning the same amount of <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Places inflexible rules on the sale of property which take no account of reasons unconnected with profit motives such as illness and additional <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that from memory the defamation law in Queensland makes it possible to defame a person by defaming a member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who may be dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in this day and age when somebody has to wait into his second pay period for compensation payments it could well mean, in the average <span class="highlight">family</span>, that things can be pretty tight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So now, in pretending to have a policy on health insurance, they are proposing a $300m first aid job to patch up the low income <span class="highlight">family</span> and pensioner sections of their scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our belief that health is a <span class="highlight">family</span> affair and a community affair and that communities must look beyond the person who is sick in bed or who is in need of medical attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It disregards the special problems of large families on low incomes, because assistance is pegged to <span class="highlight">family</span> units of 2 persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tapered assistance to low-income beneficiaries would be discontinued and full assistance provided to all eligible persons, whose eligibility would be determined by the number of dependants in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, as recommended by the Nimmo Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bankruptcy is a case in point; so too are taxation, trade practices, <span class="highlight">family</span> law, industrial property and a wide range of matters arising out of laws made by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of all this will be the payment of an extra $80 to $125 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> man in Australia if he wishes to have the coverage which is at present available to him for private wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outcome will be that members of the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia who would like to exercise a right of choice and be able to go, if they wished for one reason or another, to a private ward will receive that service only upon the payment of virtually double the present costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The publication says that the Government’s health scheme will cost the <span class="highlight">family</span> more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resulting rates will be such that it will be cheaper for a <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving the average income and below to enter a private hospital than it is at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have recognised that to earn an annual income an individual needs bodily health, that whatever he spends on maintaining the health of his body is spent on maintaining the health of the tax producing agent, that without his health he cannot produce the income on which he has to pay taxes and that without his health he cannot rear the <span class="highlight">family</span> that will pay the future taxes of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us hope that his wife does not work; let us hope that she too is not a recipient of $8,000 a year, otherwise they will be up for about $500 before they are finished to get free medicine for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of ill health is a burden on the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and the startling advances made by medicine in the past 25 years have steeply increased the cost There is, therefore, a logical case of spreading it over the whole of the community so that those that are fortunate to remain in good health may help those who temporarily fall out of the ranks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to find that 37 per cent of all taxpayers comprise husband and wife combinations, both of whom are contributing to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 3 1 per cent in the latter group in which only one person in the <span class="highlight">family</span> contributes to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, about half will be better off and half worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the additional estimated cost for 1974-75 for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> for intermediate ward accommodation in a public hospital would be $1.25 a week; accommodation in a private ward would cost an additional $1.96 a week; and accommodation in a private hospital would cost an additional $2.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The service that the Office will provide, broadly stated, will be: first, a general problem solving service of advice and assistance short of litigation to persons with an element of financial need- this will, in my view, take care of some 90. per cent of all problems that worry the ordinary citizen; and secondly, the conduct of litigation, particularly <span class="highlight">family</span> law, environmental and other litigation in areas of special concern to the Australian Government, on behalf of persons who cannot afford the cost of representation in court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959-1966 and to replace it with an up-to-date, comprehensive set of provisions dealing not only with divorce but also other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in November 1971 I moved a motion, which was carried by this Senate, that there be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry the matter of ‘the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters, with particular regard to oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During my time as a member of that Standing Committee I heard and saw a great deal of oral and written evidence put before the Committee which persuaded me that very substantial alterations to the <span class="highlight">family</span> law of this country were necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, a thrifty wife will presumably have done more to conserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> resources than a spendthrift, and should therefore receive more than the spendthrift- when the <span class="highlight">family</span> splits up- not in maintenance, but in the division of the matrimonial property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I propose that the judges of this division of the court will be selected for their personal suitability for <span class="highlight">family</span> law work, and that the division will have attached to it appropriate supportive staff, such as marriage counsellors and welfare officers, so that it will in fact be a <span class="highlight">family</span> court as generally understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has embarked on a scheme of massive legal aid, particularly in <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will extend to <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then no one should be deprived of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law remedy merely through lack of ready funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By introducing a sane, balanced law to deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> disputes, it is hoped that where marriages do break down- as they undoubtedly will continue to do so under the stresses and strains of modern life- persons will be encouraged to adjust their transition from married life with the minimum of bitterness and animosity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is a Government Bill only to the extent of facilitating its being debated and put to a vote, but the Government supports the reform of the law and administration of divorce, custody and other <span class="highlight">family</span> matters in the light of modern standards and sociology and especially so as to remove oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Public Service Board has informed me that an officer of the First or Second Division moving with his <span class="highlight">family</span> to take up an appointment in Canberra may on occasions be provided with an unfurnished Government house for rental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-84-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by payment of a continuing allowance to cover excess costs arising from the officer and his <span class="highlight">family</span> occupying temporary accommodation until suitable unfurnished premises are available; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-84-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that he enjoys very much the companionship of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and the rural pursuits which he is following assiduously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I regret his leaving us in his retirement I wish him good health and the comfort of having his <span class="highlight">family</span> about him on his farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has left behind a large <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia, I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  in expressing condolence to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the late J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was able to attend his funeral service where I made the point to his <span class="highlight">family</span> that I was representing the whole of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would all want it to be recorded that in peace and war he gave service to his country of which his <span class="highlight">family</span> can be mighty proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to associate my Party and myself with the remarks of previous speakers and to extend our sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of the Government I ask the Senate to recognise his distinguished service and to extend its sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a fellow Queenslander, as one who campaigned with him in his first election and as one who had a very high regard for him personally and as a member of the House of Representatives, on behalf of the Liberal senators I join with the Leader of the Government in expressing very sincere sympathy to Donald Cameron’s wife and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I associate my Party with the motion of condolence and on its behalf extend sympathy to  Mrs Cameron  and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party desire to be associated with the motion of condolence, and in a particular way I personally desire to express my sympathy to  Mrs Cameron  and the members of  Dr Cameron’s  <span class="highlight">family</span> in their very great loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Democratic Labor Party, I join in this motion of condolence to  Mrs Cameron  and the members of her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: What action has the Labor Government, which allegedly champions the cause of dissenters in Australia, taken to express its disapproval of the brutal action by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to exile Alexander Solzhenitsyn and his <span class="highlight">family</span> from Russia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister consider extending to Solzhenitsyn and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, on behalf of the Australian Government, an invitation to reside in Australia and continue his literary work in a free society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately that happened  Mr Grassby,  the Minister for Immigration, said that Solzhenitsyn and his <span class="highlight">family</span> could come to Australia to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are not those the price increases that must affect the ordinary worker and his <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for the Media: Is it a fact that individuals and groups are making their voices heard in protest at the fact that some television programs seem to be spearheading the decline in moral standards which can undermine the very fabric of individual, <span class="highlight">family</span> and national life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that these provisions will encourage the States to refer to this Parliament powers such as <span class="highlight">family</span> law, defamation and shipping and navigation which, in this context, have been raised at the Constitutional Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood’s  leader made an agreement that this Address-in-Reply debate would continue tonight and that any difficulties would be overlooked because it had been expected that the Senate would rise early and some people had made <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned earlier that the Prices Justification Tribunal had been provided for in Government policy and had been stated by the Government to be responsible for some of its handling of price movements in respect of many of our essential commodities which are part of the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> income is showing signs of strain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the inadequacy of the one-<span class="highlight">family</span> income in dealing with the increase in the essential goods which every <span class="highlight">family</span> requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He contented himself by saying that his Government would concentrate on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> reunion was going on anyway, side by side with active and responsible recruitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A nation is little different from a home or <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The standard of living of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is dependent on the income that the breadwinner brings into the home, not on what else he does, whether he grows a few vegetables out the back, does his own plumbing or builds his own furniture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a strange thing it is for the Whitlam Government, with its Rabelaisian tastes, a Government which will spend millions of dollars to race around the world in chartered aircraft, taking 70, 80 or 90 people along, including <span class="highlight">family</span>, relatives, and loads of champagne, to suddenly say that we must not have elections because they cost money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been assured that there will be a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far from this being purely window dressing and far from suggesting that we merely want to make a pretence of conferring powers on the States in order that they might see fit to confer powers on the Australian Government with respect, for instance, to such matters as <span class="highlight">family</span> law and defamation, I point to this offer of the Prime Minister which I respectfully suggest to honourable senators is an earnest of our sincerity and our genuineness in wanting to make this a 2 -way traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will see that the powerful communicator, television, is used to build into the nation those qualities of character which make a democracy workintegrity, teamwork and a sense of purpose by serving- and that television is used to bring faith in God to the heart of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the program ‘Class of ‘74’ still to be shown in <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by the Board that agreement was reached that a statement should be issued stating that the station had agreed with the Board that it, the station, had produced a program which was not in accordance with the Board’s <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time standards and that the station would drastically revise the program accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does it give any encouragement to a man who is working, supporting his <span class="highlight">family</span> and paying his taxes when he knows that there are other people living on social security benefits who never do a day’s work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is then to be divided into some 6 divisions of its functions- administrative, bankruptcy and insolvency, commercial, <span class="highlight">family</span>, general, and industrial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance, for example, the subject matter of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be fairly accepted that the creation by the Commonwealth of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts in the sense that persons other than judges will have a right to exercise judgment in those courts is not possible unless the members of the tribunal are to be given judicial work and, therefore, appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> courts can be created in the State jurisdictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not be able to develop a system of matrimonial or <span class="highlight">family</span> law in which <span class="highlight">family</span> courts play their part unless we were to have a system in which the State courts and the State jurisdictions were complementary, because it is only in that way that a <span class="highlight">family</span> court structure could be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice- I do not think the matter can be clearly resolved by an examination of the terms of this Bill- that it is proposed that there should be a <span class="highlight">family</span> law division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that <span class="highlight">family</span> law division will not be consistent with what is hoped for in terms of an ultimate structure in which <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts will play their part if the superior court is to be established in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as yet, in relation to those areas there has not been a delineation by this Parliament of what will be the ultimate form of the legislation, what rights will be defined and what will be the form and content of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which is before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be completely logical that we should not establish the superior court until we comprehend an inclusive Bill on <span class="highlight">family</span> law and know what will be the new approach, if any, to matrimonial causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that everybody who supports the Labor Party and everybody who supports democracy will have a look at Federation Insurance Ltd and see that it is the type of organisation which, no doubt while it pays money to people who prate about democracy and freedom of speech, is prepared to deny a man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> their livelihood because the man belongs to a legal political organisation and wishes to exercise his democratic rights as a candidate for Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its loss is bound up with such imponderables as loss of status, lack of equipment and training, problems in housing, confusion in postings, unnecessary disruptions to normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is  Senator Withers  saying that when a man is serving his country in isolated places away from his <span class="highlight">family</span> his next of kin is not entitled to similar benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Defence and the Services had been forced to bring forward the list at a moment’s notice without proper analysis and, indeed, with less consideration being given to it than the average <span class="highlight">family</span> would give to the purchase of a new washing machine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that towards the end of the last parliamentary session I introduced the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that Bill was to repeal the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959-1966 and to replace it with an up-to-date, comprehensive set of provisions dealing not only with divorce but also other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been criticised because the Human Rights Bill I introduced last year did not repeat certain provisions relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span> to be found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that I had ignored the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Human Rights Bill contained a specific provision to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> against unlawful and arbitrary interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It explicitly recognised the right to marry and to found a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No account was taken by those who said I had ignored the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the provisions in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill for marriage counselling and the services of welfare officers, or the special obligation laid on the courts and on those who will represent parties to proceedings under the Bill to consider the possibility of reconciling the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be in support of the <span class="highlight">family</span> that there should be provisions to enable a marriage that has irretrievably broken down to be dissolved and proper provision made for any children of that <span class="highlight">family</span>, for fair adjustment of property interests, and for equitable maintenance on the basis of need, all in proceedings that are intended to avoid exacerbating relations between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is the way in which legal effect can best be given to the declarations of principle concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the International Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill does not necessarily go so far as I personally would have liked to go in reforming the present <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think there are a number of areas for reform that have yet to be explored in the field of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally the Bill makes provision for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Advisory Committee, to consist of persons appointed by the AttorneyGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is to consist of a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Division of the Superior Court of Australia and of such other judges, magistrates, public servants, representatives of marriage counselling organisations and other persons as the Attorney-General thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of the Committee will be to advise the AttorneyGeneral on the working of the Act and on other matters relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I said when introducing the previous Bill, the Government supports the reform of the law and administration of divorce, custody and other <span class="highlight">family</span> matters in the light of modern standards and sociology and especially so as to remove oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose that the Bill, without technically leaving the control of the Senate, might be considered by the Committee in accordance with its reference, which is to report on the law and administration of divorce, custody and other <span class="highlight">family</span> matters with particular regard to oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should say this: It had been the intention of the previous Government that it should await the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs after its consideration of the terms of reference dealing with divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> law before presenting any Bill relating to matrimonial causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stated publicly that I think there is a great deal in the Bill which has been introduced which is constructive and which provides the basis for consideration of an appropriate divorce and <span class="highlight">family</span> law in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patients will be perfectly free, just as at present, to choose their own <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have put together a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, and even that, I think, received some favourable comments not only throughout Australia but also inside this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the middle of last year the Minister for Defence went overseas in a VIP jet along with his <span class="highlight">family</span> and friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Minister in June went abroad on a junket flight at the taxpayers’ expense, along with his <span class="highlight">family</span> and friends, saying that he was going to get replacements for the Mirage aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, he gave them away altogether and after a 12 months period decided that he would introduce a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also stated before that I am reluctant to intervene on the speaking time of an honourable senator, but the honourable senator must concede that to introduce these other matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and trade practices is going very wide of the mark and the subject matter before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pointing out to the Senate that in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> law, the Government introduced Bills which were useless, threw them out and introduced new ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that the Commonwealth Government will pay for every pensioner, every unemployed person, every disadvantaged <span class="highlight">family</span> and every new Australian who has not heard about the scheme a contribution to the present medical benefits scheme so that they will get an equal service to everybody else, a service which the Minister admits is satisfactory and of which he says the only reason for the change is the number of people eliminated under it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as applies in most households today, his wife happens to be working and, being intelligent Australians, the <span class="highlight">family</span> claims on the husband ‘s salary for the dependants, then the wife can claim no dependants at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, I suggest that the honourable senator go to the Australian Democratic Labor program and he will find that people on that sort of income- if that were their total <span class="highlight">family</span> income with 2 children- would pay nothing at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally find quite unacceptable a system whereby the man who drives my Commonwealth car in Sydney pays twice as much for the same <span class="highlight">family</span> cover as I have, not despite the fact that my income is 4 or 5 times higher than his, but precisely because of my higher income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government proposes to deduct $121.50 a year from a <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving the average income, and with one million working wives - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time that same <span class="highlight">family</span> is insured as a whole <span class="highlight">family</span> by one payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that <span class="highlight">family</span> insures under the highest scale in the medical and hospital benefits scheme, for private hospital wards and for the highest medical scale, it will cost $120 a year, and that is tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Government scheme a <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving the average weekly wage will pay $121.50 a year, and under our scheme that <span class="highlight">family</span> pays $80 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So at the present time the Government scheme would cost infinitely more, but for a poorer service, because under our scheme for $80 a year a <span class="highlight">family</span> gets cover for private ward treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Government scheme that <span class="highlight">family</span> would get cover for standard ward treatment for $ 1 2 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, under our scheme a single person pays half the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate of $ 120 a year, which is $60 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the people of Australia all want to get in a queue in order to get, as somebody pointed out earlier tonight, a service which in some instances is too quick to be effective and where there is no service by a <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor at all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pensioner receives wonderful treatment from his own <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor through a scheme which is subsidised to a degree by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally find quite unacceptable a system whereby the man who drives my Commonwealth car in Sydney pays twice as much for the same <span class="highlight">family</span> cover as I have, not despite the fact that my income is four or five times higher than his, but precisely because of my higher income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is whether all power shall go to Canberra and whether supreme power over State rights, <span class="highlight">family</span> rights, workers rights and every other right in the community shall be dominated by Canberra and the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: This election must be fought on one issue- the issue of all power to Canberra, the issue of the defence of the rights of the States, the defence of the rights of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the defence of all the other rights which are essential in any community such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Duke was a man who disliked many of the social tasks which necessarily fall upon members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> but he manfully showed a sense of public duty worthy of his high station throughout his long life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The encouragement and example he gave in these and other public duties in which your Australian subjects share, have become part of the noble tradition of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Duke of Gloucester undoubtedly was better known by personal contact in this country than was any other member of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> before the last decade, and especially before the visits of  Her  Majesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gave this Parliament power to legislate with respect to the provision of maternity allowances, widows pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, and medical and dental services but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription, benefits to students and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 April 1974 of Nicholas Edward McKenna, a former  Senator for  the State of Tasmania from 1 944 to 1 968, a Minister of the Crown from 1946 to 1949,  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1949 to 1951 and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1951 to 1966, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not leave it until this occasion respectfully to enable him to understand the sympathy which I had for the sadnesses of his <span class="highlight">family</span> lifesympathy which we have and express today- seeing the death of his wife and his son, survived by his daughter and other relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 April 1 974 of Joseph Clement Sexton, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Adelaide from 19S8 to 1966, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As part of a <span class="highlight">family</span>, I knew unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a man tried to keep his <span class="highlight">family</span> on $10 or $15 a week, which was the miserly rate of unemployment benefit paid at that time, also did not matter at all to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that pensioners tend to move from place to place among members of their <span class="highlight">family</span>, perhaps as much as or maybe even more than other members of the community do, has any thought been given to reexamining the requirement of the payment of a mail redirection fee which has applied since last October so that pensioners in this situation can be relieved of the additional cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Leader of the Australian Country Party in the other place, or any of his supporters on the Opposition benches in this place, will question the accuracy of what I am about to say because at the time referred to this newspaper was owned by his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> to which that young woman belonged was not a member of any medical benefit organisation, but in her home city one of the many doctors who have a humane outlook on life, who treat people as patients and who remember their sacred oath, treated this young woman under the pensioner medical scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be, because a doctor has to live, he has to raise his <span class="highlight">family</span> and send his children to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of making these people fight for acceptance of certain disabilities due to war service, simply put returned ex-servicemen into the higher scale of medical benefits and let him and probably his <span class="highlight">family</span> be covered for all illnesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that doctors are entitled to some free time for <span class="highlight">family</span> life and recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today a married man can go to a medical and hospital fund and insure the whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his wife is working, he can insure himself, his wife and his children for one <span class="highlight">family</span> payment for treatment in the top private hospital, all for about $130 at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think anything that forces a working <span class="highlight">family</span> to pay more money in this inflation-ridden country which the honourable senator and his colleagues have inflicted upon the people is wrong and wicked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we have a proposition that the husband, the bread winner of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, pays one sum for all and it is tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The fund charges a single person 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate and it is tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anyone say that under the scheme all working people in a <span class="highlight">family</span> shall pay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already people have pointed out that the 1.35 per cent super tax will not be imposed on only one working member of a <span class="highlight">family</span>; it will be imposed on every working member of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I personally believe that general medical practice is a specialty in itself and I also believe that specialists would be far more effective if they had some basic knowledge of <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If not, will it mean that there will be a serious cut-back in the Government’s <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion program or a cut-back in the selection of people with any special skills which are in particular need at this time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know many purposeful people who have spent years in training and who get $6,000, $7,000 or $7,500, and are rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span> on that salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know what  Senator Hall’s  income is, but I do know that he is a member of a 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> and I also believe that he has a farming property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount of $4,100 is almost absorbed in the first place by the purchase and maintenance of his motor vehicle, or even two motor vehicles if his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> are particularly active in the ordinary course of events in the pursuit of his career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance,  Senator Carrick  referred at some length to some of the problems that are encountered by a member of the Parliament in relation to the performance of his duties and in relation to that aspect of his duties which bears very much upon what happens in his <span class="highlight">family</span> and in his general <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points which  Senator Carrick  made and which appealed to me were those which referred, for instance, to the <span class="highlight">family</span> life aspect, which I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> of a member of Parliament becomes involved not only in the general political atmosphere of the home but also physically and actively in what the member is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister ask the Treasurer whether he will give serious consideration in the Budget to enabling taxpayers to claim as a tax deductible item fees for the use of ambulances, as these fees can and in many instances do impose severe financial hardship on an injured person and/or his or her <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">family</span> law there will be the choice between establishing special procedures, with judges specially selected for their aptitude for and interest in this field of law, and leaving the administration of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> law to the vagaries of 8 different systems of courts, only some of which have begun to move towards specialised <span class="highlight">family</span> law procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this type of disadvantaged <span class="highlight">family</span> were embraced in a government program of social concern and social assistance, it would assist many fathers who are attempting to care for preschool age children and younger children who are in a financially disadvantaged position at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bills we are having to make a decision which will affect every person and every <span class="highlight">family</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, in pursuance of section 73B(c) of the National Health Act 1953-1973, the Minister has directed that you shall cause alterations to be made to your organisation’s Queensland hospital fund rules to provide for the weekly contribution rate for all members to the private table to be 63 cents (single) and 51.25 (<span class="highlight">family</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Medical Benefits Fund applied for increases to take the rates up to $1.50 a week for <span class="highlight">family</span> cover and 75c a week for single people, ‘  Mr. Hayden  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us ask the many hundreds of thousands of Australian wives who are working as part of a <span class="highlight">family</span> team how they are going to enjoy having to pay 1.35 per cent of their net income as a levy for something which can now be obtained as a benefit by the breadwinner in the <span class="highlight">family</span> at a <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the proposed scheme they will pay more than they are paying now; and, if other people in the <span class="highlight">family</span> group are earning money, they will have to pay the levy as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should remind the Senate, as has been done frequently before, that there is compelling evidence that the scheme that the Government now seeks to project will cost infinitely more for the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> and will provide a dearer and inferior service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be robbed 2 ways- by monopoly levy on the pay packet and by a raid upon taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the husband of a <span class="highlight">family</span> can insure the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> under a <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The husband can cover himself, his wife and children on the one <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having paid that <span class="highlight">family</span> rate, that rate is then tax deductible to the husband and therefore is considerably reduced, even for  Mr Whitlam  ‘s driver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should add that under the existing scheme today a single person pays one half the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate and that rate is tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they join a fund as a <span class="highlight">family</span> and insure themselves they can put the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> under cover for private hospitals at the current and future rates, put in a claim for tax deductibility and end up paying less than a net $ 100 for the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> for a year- and for private ward treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is modern and trendy to tax the working wives, to rob the working <span class="highlight">family</span>, then  Mr Minister,  you can be modern and trendy on your own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government accept the Opposition’s view that home ownership is a vitally important part of <span class="highlight">family</span> life and that, given the incentive of home ownership, the pride in the area is greater, the belonging is greater and the whole venture would be more durable and more enriched? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the report of the Prices Justification Tribunal on the price of butter-on this occasion the butter does not melt in one’s mouth- one finds the bureaucratic Tribunal in accepting the costs of dairy farms in this year 1973-74, attributing to <span class="highlight">family</span> labour $2,369 and to the operator’s allowance $3,001, making a total for <span class="highlight">family</span> labour, as assessed, $5,370- less than the salary paid to any clerk in this outfit, who gets in addition maternity or paternity allowance and 4 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959-1973 and to replace it with a greatly improved, comprehensive set of provisions dealing not only with divorce but also with other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I first introduced the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill into the Senate in December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are the main reforms introduced by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators who were present in this chamber when I introduced the earlier <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, the contribution of a <span class="highlight">family</span> for the standard public hospital benefit will increase from 82c to $1.16; for the intermediate ward benefits, the contribution will increase from $1.28 to 1.80; and for the private ward benefit the contribution will increase from $1.52 to $2.14. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us listen to what the <span class="highlight">family</span> newspaper had to say about a speech by the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  in Murwillumbah on 15 June 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Take the position of a man with a wife and 2 children in New South Wales who wishes to cover himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> for intermediate hospital and medical cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us can talk academically about health schemes, doctors and hospitals until we or one of our <span class="highlight">family</span> need one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there will be double taxation in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Estimates of private insurance over and above the tax range from $ 100 to $200 a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill says, in effect, that no Australian should be placed in a position where his health or that of his <span class="highlight">family</span> can be jeopardised by his lack of money or where his health or that of his children can be further jeopardised by worry over his ability to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Labor scheme, if it had started on 1 July of this year, a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a taxable income of $2,500- that is a man who earns only a little more than $50 a week- would have to pay a special taxation levy of 1.35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present subsidised health benefits plan- imperfect though it is- with the recent alterations, a <span class="highlight">family</span> man can earn up to $3,500 and be completely covered for hospital and medical benefits with the Government paying his contributions and he still does not have to pay any special tax levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the example of an average <span class="highlight">family</span>, comprising a husband, a wife who works, and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newspaper report states quite clearly that the health bill for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man will increase by 82 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very basis of the program submitted here by my Party is to make sure that the hard-working <span class="highlight">family</span> man is not plunged into poverty through his inability to afford health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the breadwinner falls ill and has no coverage, he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> can be plunged into poverty in trying to cope with doctors and hospital bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only one in the <span class="highlight">family</span> but every income earner, every taxpayer, in the <span class="highlight">family</span> will have to pay the compulsory levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance the case of a working <span class="highlight">family</span> which has to pay out an increasing amount for insurance cover; has to remember to go to the chemist regularly to pay for that cover; has to remember, if the contributor changes jobs and the boss has been making deductions from his pay, to make other arrangements to have the payments made or else when the wife has a baby in 3 months’ time or when Johnny has appendicitis there is no money; and which has to wait for repayments to arrive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> and similar families are all desperately wanting a scheme that looks after paying the bills in some civilised and easy way so that there is one more thing about which they do not have to worry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every calamity which they predicted as a result of the health scheme which we are debating this afternoon is already part and parcel of health care arrangements for which the Opposition is responsible and with which every ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> becomes involved in times of sickness or injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until 2 December 1972 the capital investment in bauxite, alumina and aluminium- the alumina <span class="highlight">family</span>, if you like- was $ 1,297m; the investment in coal- one commodity-was $207m; the investment in copper, lead and zinc was $603m; the investment in iron ore was $ 1,472m; and the investment in nickel was $390m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this person comes into the hands of certain people, whether it be the Russian consul or other people who are involved, and he is isolated from those to whom he originally went and sought residence in Australia- he told them he wished to stay in Australia and he gave the reasons why he wished to stay in Australia and they were not political reasons- he will then come under the pressure of the consul and because his own <span class="highlight">family</span> is in Russia he will be threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death on 31 August 1974 of the Right Honourable Norman Kirk, Prime Minister of New Zealand from December 1972, and expresses to the people of New Zealand profound regret and to his <span class="highlight">family</span> tender sympathy in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All Australians will join the people of New Zealand and his <span class="highlight">family</span> in mourning him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of the Opposition senators I extend our deepest sympathy and concern to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the main, his love was his <span class="highlight">family</span> and those people whom he represented, particularly the less fortunate people in Western Australia and in other parts of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Senate may be invited to proceed to debate the second reading of the Bill before 17 October when presumably this Committee will present its report on the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way the Senate, in debating the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, would have the advantage of the matter which has been considered by the Committee up to date on the general philosophy of matrimonial causes legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity also to inform the Senate that I have taken note of the proposal that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which under the Bill is included in the Superior Court, be taken out of that Court and that a separate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be very difficult to provide for a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court outside the structure of the Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the question will be resolved before we get to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there is the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know how the passage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, or the debate on it, is going to cure the great national problem of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat what has already been said on this side of the Senate today: There is a long arm of memory in relation to these people, and there is always the uncertainty and the question mark relating to his freedom and that of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator JAMES McCLELLANDHonourable senators will recall that yesterday in my capacity as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs I tabled an interim report on the law and administration of divorce and related matters and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at ‘the death on 26 September 1974 of the Right Honourable  Sir Eric  Harrison, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Wentworth from 1 93 1 to 1956, and during this’ time a Minister of the Crown, Acting Prime Minister,’  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and Resident Minister in London, and then from 1956 to 1964 High Commissioner for Australia in London, and that it places on record its appreciation of his long and distinguished public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Government I extend our sympathy to his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>, and I commend the motion to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expressions of sympathy that were conveyed at that State ceremony yesterday to Lady Harrison and her <span class="highlight">family</span>, and the widely representative groups that attended to convey their respects to the memory of the man who had passed away, made it a very moving occasion for us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had integrity not only in his home life and <span class="highlight">family</span> life but also in his parliamentary life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He loved his <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had a love of nature and an eagerness, right until his final illness, to serve Australia as he did as a citizen, as a <span class="highlight">family</span> man, as a parliamentarian, as an ex-serviceman and as a diplomat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable senators of the Liberal Party join in supporting the motion moved by the Leader of the Government to express our sincere sympathy to Lady Harrison and her <span class="highlight">family</span> and our profound admiration of one who served Australia so faithfully and well throughout his adult lifetime and made a tremendous contribution in this time to our history and to the progress and development of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not precisely spell out the situation but  Mr Watson  has been a consultant in connection with the drawing up of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and the various amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It stops the depriving of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the income of the breadwinner who is in gaol when he has done no more to society than enjoy himself and have too much to drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing is said about spouses, about <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts or about the methods whereby a person can set out deliberately as a member of the Parliament to hide his income but retain control as well as the ownership of his assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are places where young married people are able to mould their lives along the paths of their own choice; they are places where they can mould the lives of their young children and where the love within a <span class="highlight">family</span> can develop without the hindrance of pressures that intrude unless people have their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say unquestionably that under this concept of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> life where for various reasons women return to work after a period of years, the provision of pre-school child minding facilties is a must. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This decision, in common with many other actions of the Government, seems to have been dictated by pressures from within the trade union movement which seems not to want to appreciate, or is unable to appreciate, that the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> in rural areas is often involved 7 days a week for up to 12 hours a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last weekend  Dr Cairns,  on a trial run for Acting Prime Minister before going to see Chou En-lai with his <span class="highlight">family</span> and others in a VIP aircraft, visited Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are paid a lump sum to invest as they think will best benefit themselves and their <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities in their old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will mention just one of them: The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau is the only <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling bureau in Sydney for a large number of people from poor areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not need to remind you how dangerous and destructive inflation can be for the worker and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in relation to that review, he has given an undertaking that <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions will be given the highest priority, that applications which are presently being processed will not be affected, that generally the objectives to which the honourable senator refers will be maintained and there will be no departure from those objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is of vital importance to what is, or has been, a major <span class="highlight">family</span> organisation business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I present the report of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on the law and administration of divorce and related matters and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the result, the Committee has recommended many amendments ranging from small suggestions for more exact drafting to such major innovations as the proposal for the setting up of a totally new and separate <span class="highlight">family</span> court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal involves the assimilation of all <span class="highlight">family</span> matters into one court, with active pre-divorce and post-divorce counselling not merely to assist reconciliation but also to provide for the reduction of bitterness and distress and alleviating ongoing post-divorce problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I imagine that the report will be of considerable assistance to all honourable senators in the consideration of the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill when it comes on for debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that the report will be of some assistance to persons outside the Parliament who are interested in the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that part of the misapprehension which exists at the present time is due to what I have ascertained to be a fact, namely, that copies of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill were not easily obtainable and in some places frankly were not obtainable until some steps were taken to have increased supplies made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters with particular regard to oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it will be recalled that throughout 1972 the attitude of the previous Government was not to proceed with its own inquiry into what were the necessary reforms in the area of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> law generally but to await the report of this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a report, which I am sure will be valuable, on the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not have a report on the whole question of the philosophy and the objectives which <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation should be recognising and endeavouring to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference of the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to this Committee stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders, the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs be empowered on its reappointment to consider the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1 974 during its consideration of the matter previously referred to it, namely the Law and Administration of Divorce, Custody and <span class="highlight">Family</span> Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are denied by this report is the consideration by this Committee of all the submissions which it received prior to 1973 in terms of what should be the objectives of <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee did not ask for any general submissions from the public as to the clauses of this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen spoke on the subject of the presentation of the report by my colleague,  Senator James  McClelland, from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs relating to its consideration and its recommendations after its deliberations on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that this question is related to a misunderstanding of the nature of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, under which some resident medical officers may attend such centres as part of their training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we are very concerned about proposals to alter the law in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 would fundamentally change the institution of marriage itself; that is all existing and future marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The points system was designed to enable the stations to bring about a diversity of programming having regard to their choice and also having regard to the time slots for children’s viewing time, <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time and matters of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I went through the Bill with them and asked them whether they could make any suggestion for an alteration of the existing law, such as to the grounds for divorce, whether they wanted to retain the particular grounds of adultery, desertion and so on, or whether they wanted a change in any of the particular matters contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Petition to register objections to the introduction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill into the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We, the undersigned persons, interested in the welfare of the <span class="highlight">family</span> life in Australia and the maintenance of community standards, desire to bring to the notice of the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled, the registration of protests to the principle contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that the proposed legislation does not support the principle laid down by United Nation’s Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which states “The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State”, in that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present law provides that consideration is given to the support of wife and children; it would seem that in the proposed law it will be far more difficult for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to receive just consideration in the event of a dissolution of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 27 September 1974, at La Trobe in Tasmania, the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr Cairns,  assured people at a public meeting that the capital gains tax would not apply to a property left by a farmer to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, 1974 would fundamentally change the institution of marriage itself; that is all existing and future marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The said Bill does not protect the legal and social rights of women and children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that this Bill be tabled for 6 months and that all sections of the community be consulted on marriage, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the long term effects of such a Bill upon our Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There must be urgent reform and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill must be presented to Parliament forthwith and accepted without further delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the breach of agreement should incur legal process and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill used as a last resort, with <span class="highlight">family</span> courts for enforcement only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motivation of lawyers in <span class="highlight">family</span> matters is for profit only and their involvement has proved a disaster for the community since 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of  Senator Chaney  and myself I give contingent notice of motion of an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, contingent upon the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 being considered in Committee of the Whole, I shall move the following amendment: Page IS, clause 26, sub-clause (2), line 5, leave out ‘twelve months’, insert ‘two years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister noted that this rise means that the price of bread- a staple part of <span class="highlight">family</span> diet- has risen by 32 per cent since the Federal elections in May? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I present the transcript of the in camera evidence from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on its inquiry into the law and administration of divorce and matters related to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The rate of the allowance will be $10 a week and it will be paid where, because of the nature and severity of the handicap, the child requires constant care and attention in the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONWhile recognising that the order of business is the prerogative of the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  and without in any way reflecting upon what I may subsequently do in respect of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill in an entirely different context from the present context, I suggest to  Senator Murphy  that having regard to the tremendous concern and interest as borne out by the number of petitions to the Senate in respect of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, and also having in mind the nature of reporting of Senate proceedings, I ask him to consider bringing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill on tomorrow instead of today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excise)- It was arranged last week that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill would be brought on today and I do not see that those arrangements ought to be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was agreed between us that debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, as a result of constant representations brought to me by  Senator Murphy,  would take place today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been arranged that, subject to  Senator Wheeldon  being here at 8 o’clock, the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will be interrupted so that  Senator Wheeldon  can have the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1974 and the Social Services Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 is a Bill of the greatest importance to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on this Bill we must bear in mind that there is also in existence the Marriage Act which covers many areas that are complementary to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may be very necessary to complement the changes which will be made in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law as provided in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it must be said early in the debate that the <span class="highlight">family</span> as we know it in Australia is not broken, as some people seem to think; it is in fact a greater institution than it has ever been in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of divorce legislation indicates that harsh laws have frequently been introduced and retained not because they were considered meritorious in themselves but because they were considered a safeguard to the stability of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A high divorce rate will weaken the structure of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since society is based on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, society itself will therefore be threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Divorce can thus be seen as actually contributing to marriage stability, by rechannelling conflicting partners and their children into more viable <span class="highlight">family</span> settings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed, as the AttorneyGeneral has said, to alleviate the high costs, delays and indignities of divorce and other aspects of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that State a successful <span class="highlight">family</span> court is operating and that may be the reason why it is not found necessary to use the power of imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these proposals, which I consider the most important, is to recommend the establishment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judges who will go around the countryside sitting in one provincial city after another and doing most of the hard work of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court should not be old judges or ‘geriatric judges’ as they have been described by one of our Senate colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereby we can have younger judges who are particularly suited to the work which a <span class="highlight">family</span> court requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occasionally he might do a little <span class="highlight">family</span> court work, very often disliking that sort of work because it is not the matter on which he has spent most of his legal career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a very detailed study which he made of the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts of America and Canada he came to the conclusion that such a court was a very suitable facility for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have reached the conclusion that <span class="highlight">family</span> courts would be a desirable improvement to Australia’s legal system, provided they have this ancillary function of counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also feel that the gathering together in the one court (or in 2 courts along the lines suggested by the Sydney University Law Graduates Association) of all the <span class="highlight">family</span> matters mentioned in paragraph 4 above would be attractive to the legal profession and public alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recommended that a <span class="highlight">family</span> court be adopted and that there be co-operation with the States so that it will work with success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition let me refer to a report from certain Canadian specialists who were asked to consider the question of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that these problems of conflicting and fragmented jurisdictions, and the advantages of consistency in philosophy and approach, expertise in dealing with the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship, and practical use of social services, can best be dealt with by the creation of one Court with exclusive jurisdiction in the field of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a blue print for the future, this kind of scheme is being given very serious consideration in Canada, and indeed a pilot <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court Conciliation scheme has recently been set up by the Canadian Federal Government in Edmonton, where its success is exceeding all expectations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia the one <span class="highlight">family</span> court which has been set up in South Australia, which unfortunately is dealing only with those jurisdictions below the Supreme Court level, has been an outstanding success in the last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee considered many other aspects of the Bill apart from the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Synod urgently commends to the Australian Parliament that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 be amended in the interests of the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic unit of our society to provide that no application may be made for divorce under the Bill until the parties have lived separately and apart for at least 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Committee see that we are dealing with a completely new ‘ball game’ in the sense that a <span class="highlight">family</span> court will make a tremendous difference to all areas covered by the legislation and that proper operation of that <span class="highlight">family</span> court will mean that throughout the year of separation there will be a helping, on-going court to which people can appeal and which can actually be involved in the problems surrounding the question of whether a reconciliation is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a different situation if there is an active, operating <span class="highlight">family</span> court operating during the period of the separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We bear in mind again the effect which a <span class="highlight">family</span> court would have in filling out and giving substance to these provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the provision of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court will make them matters of reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be such special circumstances where a wife is not by law entitled to any <span class="highlight">family</span> property which she owns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One major recommendation of the Committee is the upgrading of the advisory body recommended in the Bill into a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that any <span class="highlight">family</span> law must be strong, useful and constructive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter which, in my view, will make this divorce law an enlightened, humane and dignified proceeding is found in the suggestion that has come from our Committee for the institution of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that the Attorney-General has been persuaded that the suggestion that has come from the Committee for the institution of an entirely separate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is a good one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The notion of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is well established in some parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the benefit of some evidence from a judge of the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that a court should be set up which deals with nothing but <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assimilation of all <span class="highlight">family</span> matters into one court, with active pre-divorce and post-divorce counselling not merely to assist reconciliation but also to provide for the reduction of bitterness and distress and in alleviating on-going postdivorce problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present circumstances it is unreasonable that she should have to wait until a circuit <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court visited Bourke or some neighbouring large town, or that she should have to go to Sydney or even to Dubbo or some place like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what we have in mind as a development of this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We imagine this Court being a court which goes to the people, which travels around the country and, indeed, which travels to places like Bourke and not at long intervals, so that the atmosphere of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court which we regard as so important will be available not only to dwellers in the big metropolitan centres but also to people in far-flung, small towns and isolated localities throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in a combination of this humanitarian ground of irretrievable breakdown provable by 12 months separation and a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- an exclusive, specialist <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courtstaffed by carefully selected judges and assisted by experts such as welfare officers, counsellors, psychologists, accountants and other people such as accountants who might advise those whose marriage is in difficulty primarily because they cannot handle their finances on how to get their affairs in order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in reply to  Senator Baume  ‘s question, there must be grave doubt at this time whether this sort of thing could be taken within the purview of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report to the Swedish Government one of its Ministers, in talking about the overhaul of legislation on <span class="highlight">family</span> matters in 1969, put it in this way: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span>’s options are also frequently limited by a lack of child day-care centres and nursery schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I would like to say just this, that the illusion that tightening up divorce laws is the best way to counter the disintegration of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is something that we have to face squarely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are discussing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again the members and the public are staggered that the Senate appointed a Committee of Lawyers to provide amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall limit my contribution to some of the social areas; to discussing what we mean by marriage, what we mean by divorce and what we should mean by <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who have been looking at the Bill and who have been lobbying us have a valid point if they say that it is only in the past 2 weeks- it is less than that actually, because this document has not been on sale for the past 2 weeks- or during the period that the report has been on sale in the bookshops that they have been able to analyse the new, new, new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, depending upon which model we look at, to analyse the amendments and to work out what they might want to say in reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wrong if we saw the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill solely in terms of the legal framework of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what new ideas come, we must try now to protect the stable bonding of man and woman and provide a stable situation in which children can be brought up and protected and in which <span class="highlight">family</span> life can be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more stress on people as individuals; less of our needs are met from within the <span class="highlight">family</span>; more things are done in schools; more of our needs are met from outside; people turn less to the <span class="highlight">family</span> for their recreational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> structure itself has altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is less supported and less extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made a large number of comments relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> life, <span class="highlight">family</span> structure and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are thinking about <span class="highlight">family</span> law and <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bills we are thinking about a situation in which one-fifth or one-quarter of the marriages in our society will break down and end in the divorce court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough for us to start talking about buttressing the <span class="highlight">family</span> at the point of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very keen to ensure that under this Bill we do not create the situation where a whole generation of women who have contributed to <span class="highlight">family</span> life and to the bringing up of children are now left with nothing but the chance to go back and work for subsistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation where conduct comes back into the field of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and no one society should think of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law situation where conduct is not relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill- not necessarily this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill but an ideal Bill- we should be seeking a way of creating better marriages and in some way of maintaining those marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be better if the counselling services were provided separately from the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view is that the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts will use these facilities well- there is no question about thatand they will be extremely valuable to their functioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at what the Americans have done, I remind the Senate that they set up an ad hoc committee on a Standard <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the National Council of Crime and Delinquency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not really a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill in the sense that it takes in the measures which I would like to have seen to support and strengthen marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only secondarily a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill of the kind I would like to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to the extent that the Bill does not work to hold families together or to strengthen the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in our society, the Bill fails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to see some consideration given to whether counselling services might better exist outside the <span class="highlight">family</span> court, though still working closely with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also hope it will be followed by the other measures which are so necessary to strengthen marriage and to buttress <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that the attention of many thousands of people throughout Australia is focused on the Senate as it debates the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and that that attention will continue to be given to this debate until the Committee stage has been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore to me pleasing to observe, if I may do so, that the debate on this Bill, which by now has extended over some hours, has been of an extremely high standard, free from the acrimony which is often associated with debates in this chamber and, I believe, indicative of the fact that it is the wish of all honourable senators to ensure that the best <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation can be enacted without undue delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposals of reform have ranged from the suggestion that marriage should be a 5 -year renewable contract, recently put forward by an American social worker,  Mrs Virginia  Satir, to more sophisticated proposals for including breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce and the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and courts of domestic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without hesitation that a vast amount of the money that has been paid to lawyers over the years under the present system would have been far better spent in being applied to the proper purposes of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, including the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as the present system remains and so long as present procedure remains, the payment of sums that ought to be kept within the <span class="highlight">family</span> or within one or more members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> will go on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would, of course, be true to say very simply that the 2 principal amendments that are proposed to the existing law are, firstly, with regard to the ground for dissolution of marriage and, secondly, with regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span> court, and I propose to deal with each of those in turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During its sessions a Resolution was carried in relation to the current <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, August 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resolution: ‘That this National Marriage Guidance Council of Australia, in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, August 1974, welcomes the removal of” fault”, and the introduction of “irretrievable breakdown” as the sole ground for dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second basic feature of the Committee’s report which one understands will be accepted by the Government is the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court and the making of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court the kernel of the administrative processes of the system established by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not pause to delay the Senate on that other than to say 2 things: Firstly, at the time of the Committee’s deliberations the South Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> court system was beginning to be regarded as the model on which the States could well base their systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Act no application need be made if the Committee’s recommendation is adopted before the counselling procedures of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court can be set in train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee certainly did not envisage, so far as I am aware, that the only source of counselling should be through the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not a case, if this was what  Senator Baume  had in his mind, where the <span class="highlight">family</span> court counselling procedures would be in any way exclusive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of cases in which thousands of dollars has been expended on legal procedures which, as I said earlier, could much more properly have been put at the disposal of members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining matter I want to mention relates to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council which is dealt with on page 35 of the report of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if this Bill is passed, I doubt whether we have seen the last of the efforts of the Australian Parliament to pass a completely proper <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council has to be brought into the on-going consideration of the propriety of our legislation in a very vital and very concerned way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see this Bill, if it is passed in substantially the form recommended by the Committee, as introducing for the first dme a benign, nationalistic approach to a matter which either affects or potentially can affect any <span class="highlight">family</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing this account of my life has given me no pleasure at all and it goes without saying that if I had my time all over again I would have gone about things very differently, lt is to be hoped that the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will go a long way to eliminating this humiliating and degrading exercise and make settlements fairer and less traumatic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak very briefly in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- perhaps,  Mr Deputy President,  I should warn you of that fact in view of the state of the Senate- because much of the ground which one might cover has already been covered so competently by  Senator Missen, Senator James  McClellend and  Senator Everett  among other honourable senators who have already spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does that undermine for all time the relationship between the 2 parties to the marriage but it seriously undermines, in my view, the possibility of a proper relationship being arrived at after divorce by the parents with each other and with their children so that some degree of <span class="highlight">family</span> fabric and a proper relationship may be maintained for the benefit of those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involved not only the parties to a particular marriage but also a whole network of relationships with relatives of various kinds in what might properly be called an extended <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the 1970s the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships which existed and which, I believe, may have been a very strong bolster to the institution of marriage, no longer exist to the same extent in urbanised societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its people are alienated from each other, and its <span class="highlight">family</span> units are no longer of an extended nature in that they are alienated by distance and by the complexities of travel in large cities and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today engagements tend to be of shorter duration and are part of a much more anonymous society than the one which existed when marriage was a truly viable institution of the extended <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that this legislation in fact constitutes an attack on the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, the <span class="highlight">family</span> as an institution is under attack, and it is under attack because of the pressures of urban life, the alienation of citizens one from the other, and an inability to cope with the pressures and complexities of life generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In their concern to preserve the institution of marriage, for reasons which are expressed in that document, they set out a number of considerations which they regard as important in the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is proper to say that the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> must be seen in its historical context and as subject to change under contemporary pressures which cannot be relieved or even improved upon by legislation of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, one claim made by a body known as the Foundation for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> in relation to the fault ground is as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be a shallow analogy because divorce may be said to affect in some way the fabric of our society if one accepts the view, which I think we must subject to critical analysis, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is not itself a changing institution and that the tendency in our society is for relationships to develop outside the marriage extra-marital relationships- in a way to which we might not have been used some 20 years or 25 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation does direct itself in a positive way to trying to grapple, insofar as man-made institutions can do, with the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships and of human relationships in a much more meaningful way than I believe the existing legislation does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those relates to the provision of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation proposes a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish that all honourable senators had had the opportunity to hear the views of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and particularly the evidence of Judge Burnett of the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard the views and experience of a very distinguished South Australian legal practitioner, now a judge, who after years of almost despair and synicism, as he put it, over the operations of divorce law and its effects in Australia, is now a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We gained the impression from him- and I hope that some honourable senators will have an opportunity to visit the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to observe it- of a court which deals with problems which come before it with great dignity, humanity and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the <span class="highlight">family</span> court proposals to the Senate, without dealing with them in any detail, as a new and desirable social concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s report recommends a substantial improvement in this situation so that future <span class="highlight">family</span> problems will not be determined in part by the availability of finance to the parties involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 9 1 of the Bill provides for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Advisory Committee in respect of which a new draft section has been suggested in the report of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion to establish a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Advisory Committee to see <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation as a continually evolving and growing thing is a very important recommendation of the Committee and a very important provision in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I must say that I am deeply concerned at the implications which go with and are part of <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation generally and, in particular, that legislation which is before us now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is just what this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does; it provides for a separation of a couple for 12 months as absolute grounds for a divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law has become the object of increasing concern to the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a thorough contemplation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is very necessary, but to look at the proposed Bill solely from the viewpoint of divorce is, I think, irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to the other group which looks at the Bill in the light of what the Australian community understands by marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 23(1), with which we have declared ourselves to be in agreement, says that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we accept these 2 definitions, I cannot but have serious doubt about the consequences of enacting the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 as it has been presented to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who take the marriage contract seriously and those who verify the importance of a stable <span class="highlight">family</span> life within society point to these facts: The Bill is not related merely to divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the centre of our way of living, and I can see more and more that this will be broken down unless some amendments are introduced to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could well call for an amendment to clause 26 of the Bill which would increase the period of separation to 3 years in the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which there are children under the age of 18 but retain the period of 1 year where the children have been brought up and are over the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It changes fundamentally existing marriages, continuing marriages and the <span class="highlight">family</span> which develops about those marriages and, as I have said, our whole society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does attempt to improve reconciliation and counselling procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if one weighs the arguments for and against the proposed <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill; if one takes into account the fact that the majority of people have not been in a position to study the Bill and do not have a clear picture of the implications of the Bill; and if one has serious doubts whether the Bill promotes marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> as stable institutions guaranteeing the healthy nurture of children, one cannot but have feelings of grave doubt with respect to the enactment of this Bill in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">family</span> law should at all times be beyond any reasonable doubt of benefit to the members of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill certainly will benefit those who wish to break the marriage relationship in a speedy and convenient manner but it does not benefit those who seek the legal protection of their marriage relationship and their <span class="highlight">family</span> and who are prepared to do their part by living up to individual and communal responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there is no doubt that the Committee, in the course of its work in relation to this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, was a very great credit to the Senate indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a deep, involved and complex matter concerning the most intimate human relationship- that is the relationship which exists between a man and his wife in the intimacy of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the inclusion in this year’s Budget of $ 10 a week as a payment to parents or guardians of physically or mentally  / handicapped children under the age of 16 who are cared for in a <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I am sure that those who work within the social welfare field acknowledge that there is deprivation in the emotional sense in a one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> and that there is deprivation in those families who reach the poverty level because of the problems of single parenthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of the overall scheme of the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>, in terms of the overall total population, both adult and child in Australia, that is not a large number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I would think, and I would imagine that everybody would agree with me, that the stable <span class="highlight">family</span> life is the one we wish to see all Australian children enjoy, and I think putting the emphasis on the effect of this type of situation on this admittedly comparatively small number of children is what we should be concentrating on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it has done the women of Australia any good to have this special privilege in the area of widows pensions because it makes it look as though it is a problem germane only to women in Australia instead of what it truly is, namely a <span class="highlight">family</span> problem in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a strong plea to the Government that, in these inquiries and considerations that it appears to be undertaking, it look at just the simple facts, and that is that we have a <span class="highlight">family</span> situation in which there is only one parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was of the understanding- I thought it was a fairly clear understanding- that no pensions were available for Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> men in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made particularly to the absence of the mother’s care because the mother was in hospital or she was temporarily absent from the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suppose there would be one of us in this chamber who has not at some stage come face to face with the reality of the problems of marital relationships in some part of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept unreservedly the tremendous value of what has been put to us up to the present time, but it is necessary for those of us who have had experience in <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships, as many of us have, to relate to this chamber our own experience and to bring a fullness to the debate which will enable us to make a quiet, dispassionate judgment on the merit of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the great attraction that this Bill has for me is the provision of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and also the understanding which I have that proper procedures will be laid down and proper attention will be given to the economic circumstances of families or parts of families who are so seriously disadvantaged as a consequence of the dissolution of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were not the provision for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in this legislation, my attitude to it would take a different course altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anybody asked me to support a situation which took people into open court, where they took their place in the line among the felons, the thieves and the villains of the community, to get a resolution of this deep, emotional and complex <span class="highlight">family</span> problem, I say here and now that I would never do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in my experience of adopting the role of a quasi-counsellor in relation to those deep, perplexing, distressing and troubling sorts of problems, I found that where there was a sincere desire on the part of both partners to get away from those influences in the community which seemed to want to perpetuate the difficulties between them- often times <span class="highlight">family</span>, friends, acquaintances and associates in the community- by getting them to talk like sensible, reasonable, fully developed and intellectually developed human beings one could get some sense into the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have very sincere reasons for saying that when people are compelled to present a facade of a relationship together, my goodness, it can have a damaging effect upon members of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of one situation- I will not go deeply into the circumstances of it- in which a husband and wife were compelled by all sorts of social conventions, <span class="highlight">family</span> urgings and that sort of thing to stay together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually they wrecked the mental health of the 3 children of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see the removal from the ordinary courts of the land of any process for the resolution of <span class="highlight">family</span> problems, whether it is divorce, maintenance or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that emphasis will be placed upon that aspect of human behaviour as a consequence of this Billfamily courts, counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in those circumstances we must do all we can to assuage the grief of people who are caught up in these matters and apportion a reasonable degree of responsibility to people who have accepted an economic responsibility of raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such an important area as marriage and matrimonial law or, as it is called in this Bill, <span class="highlight">family</span> law, we certainly find a great deal of interest shown by members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to apply that comment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, as  Senator Murphy  has named it, one could readily recall what has happened since the introduction of the first <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy has progressively introduced several <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bills- I think that this is the third. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The title of the Bill, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, is an innovation in terms of its objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree that the Bill is correctly cited as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it can well be argued that some of the provisions of the Bill make it possible for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to be broken up earlier than would be the case under the existing matrimonial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the nature and structure of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, one can certainly refer to ouselves as being a signatory to the United Nations International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is a natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and by the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are a signatory to the Convention, we must uphold with law the <span class="highlight">family</span> group in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it is from the point of view of the development of the economy, whether it is from the point of view of the development of the citizen himself or whether it is from the point of view of the upbringing of children and their gradual enrolment in our society, one sees that the basis of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is something which we in this Senate must uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The California <span class="highlight">Family</span> Act of 1969 contains only 2 grounds: irreconcilable differences which have caused the irredeemable breakdown of marriage, and incurable insanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is quoted as saying that the California <span class="highlight">Family</span> Act of 1969 is obviously an attractive precedent There was an English Law Commission which suggested that an explicit agreement that the 2 criteria adopted by the English Law Commission should be the grounds for good divorce law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my reading of this Bill, this legislation is creating the situation in which one partner, should he or she so desire, can leave the <span class="highlight">family</span> bed for a period of more than 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to Part III which states that reconciliation is to be a vital part of the proposed new <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Attorney-General is here I think I should say that he has attempted in many ways during his term to place among the statutes of this country acceptable matrimonial law, irrespective of whether it is called <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it is not authenticated I believe that the Minister is likely to agree with the proposal for <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After 30 years of marriage during which she faithfully served her husband and <span class="highlight">family</span> she may find that her husband wishes to dissolve the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is resumed from last evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I paid a compliment to  Senator Murphy  last evening for his persistence in pursuing the introduction of a new matrimonial law, which he has called a <span class="highlight">family</span> law, to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submissions have been made to me which suggest that this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill must not be delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that was the position in 1972 and early 1973 when the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  first laid down those regulations which were supposed to be essentially to revise <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I understand that the Attorney-General himself is taking advantage of the opportunity to alter the Bill which he presented originally as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could readily argue for some time about that clause which is the basis upon which this new <span class="highlight">family</span> law wishes to upgrade existing matrimonial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In past times the woman was really the servant of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having got over the first flush of marriage and finding herself tied down to the management of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and faced with many of the problems which go with the haste of life today, such as her partner finding the work in which he is involved a great strain- and there are many parts of marriage which are the cause of frustration- she realises that all this can be avoided under different marital circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relationship between man and woman and the development of a home and <span class="highlight">family</span> still bind us to the best institution there can be for people in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the law that is proposed there is the idea of marriage counselling for parties that come before the <span class="highlight">family</span> law court, but that counselling may be applied only to those who are seeking at the court door some change in their marriage status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is marriage guidance on the general problems of living together, the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship and sexuality in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let no one say that this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill should be passed through this Senate quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has my support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it was unfair of the many people who have sent letters to honourable senators saying that they must not oppose the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, but I feel that in many areas it needs amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the many recommendations which have come forward as a result of the excellent work done by those associated with the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs suggest that a great deal of variation is required to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which is before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of that our hope is this concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It generally involves the creation of a special court (or division of a larger court), the assimilation of all <span class="highlight">family</span> matters into one court, with active pre-divorce and post-divorce counselling not merely to assist reconciliation, but also to provide for the reduction of bitterness and distress and in alleviating on-going post-divorce problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see that- should be chosen for their experience and understanding of <span class="highlight">family</span> problems and should be drawn from existing Judges, members of the bar and solicitors, according to their particular suitability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They contribute to the <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare and still have 2 jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For people to write that, one can imagine the sort of bitterness there is in this area and the very real job that a <span class="highlight">family</span> court, a <span class="highlight">family</span> law commission and those who give post and pre-divorce advice will have to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Young women are abandoned when the pressure of supporting a <span class="highlight">family</span> forces husbands to desert them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very much in favour of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law court and a <span class="highlight">family</span> law commission which will work to the greatest advantage of all concerned and do away with the spite and bitterness as much as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a number of honourable senators have pointed out that this Bill, although it is styled the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, does in fact fundamentally alter, in their opinion, the nature of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I must emphasise again that I reject any concept of marriage other than the one man, one woman, one <span class="highlight">family</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has rationalised the bases on which the scheme rests and it will be for the Senate Committee to do in this case what it did in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, that is, to consider all the material, to take evidence from such persons or groups as it considers appropriate and to submit to the Senate a report on the clauses of the Bill in, I imagine, very much the same way as it did in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular the submissions which weighed heavily with me were the one from the National Council of Women and the one from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Life Movement of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to move on from the question of grounds for divorce to another major provision of the Bill, and that is the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill itself does not provide for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, and that is, I think, perhaps its major deficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Senate Committee has recommended the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, and I am pleased to find now that the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  has accepted that recommendation and has already submitted to us a detailed amendment which is designed to set up the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in the way in which he envisages it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can argue whether it ought to be a Federal court, a State court and so on, and I do not want to get into that argument now, and I think it would be unfortunate if that argument took over one’s consideration in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one absolutely fatal deficiency in the proposal to set up a purely Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is the requirement in the Constitution that all judges appointed by the Federal Government under the Constitution have to be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just cannot conceive that we ought to have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court system where the judges could be in their 80s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be ridiculous to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> court composed of people of this age who will have to deal with these very sensitive personal issues, changes in social attitudes and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which that can be done is the way which was suggested in the Senate Committee’s report, namely, that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be set up under a co-operative arrangement between the Federal Government and the State governments so that a majority of the judges of the court will be appointed by the State governments and will be subject, as State judges can be, to retirement at a suitable age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should start talking immediately with the State governments to set up by a process of co-operation the type of <span class="highlight">family</span> court which we all envisage as desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> court according to the amendment prepared by the Attorney-General is envisaged as a court which will be well serviced by experts in behavioural science and counselling activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I wish to speak briefly on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most distressing side effect to me has been the bitterness and personal hatred, which has split <span class="highlight">family</span> and friends, arising out of the legal and psychological warfare which seems to have been associated with prolonged divorce proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change from the extended biological <span class="highlight">family</span> we had in the past to the more fragile nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>, the increase in the breadth of education for women in our society and the changing role of opportunities for women have all made marriage a more stressful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting up of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court, which  Senator Durack  mentioned, will, one hopes, remove the sort of stigma of criminality which was associated with divorce proceedings in some people’s minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON (New South Wales) (9.35)-The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 is a Bill in relation to which any honourable senator will, as we say in parliamentary language, have a completely free vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the heart of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is weak, even dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to draw attention to certain basic changes which will be made to the nature of the marriage contract if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 becomes law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, by sections 26, 27 and 28, effects a fundamental alteration in the nature of the marriage contract by making it voluntarily terminable by either party to the marriage, even when one party abandons the other against his or her will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these as well as other reasons, we are opposed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which has been introduced to the Senate by the Attorney-General and hope that it will be rejected by both Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would support strongly suggestion to defer consideration of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill for 6 months to enable interested people to examine report of Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presented 2 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However we must, in good conscience, speak out against the radical changes proposed in the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974, and ask for six months’ delay in any further debate on it, so that the clauses of the Bill and the extensive amendments proposed by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, can be properly and responsibly assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter continues: the evidence taken by the Standing Committee with regard to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, 1974, appears to have been taken in camera, thus putting it out of the reach of Parliament and the public, and therefore being inconsistent with the concept of Open Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the full implications of the setting up of the Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are not yet realized. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Selby, Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division of the N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit- the combination of husband and wife- is responsible for both the procreation and the rearing of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the pattern of our community, the social attitudes of the individuals comprising the Australian community are the product of <span class="highlight">family</span> influences- both good influences and bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is in the light of those facts that this Bill has to be consideredfirstly, the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to the community and, secondly, the fact that marriages do break down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ensure that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill when it is passed- if it is passed by us- meets those criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I take the time of the Senate to remind honourable senators of the proposals for a <span class="highlight">family</span> court; the proposal that proceedings for dissolution should not be commenced until the ground for dissolution has arisen and the proposal that counselling should be brought in before dissolution proceedings, if possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these are positive suggestions which go to the <span class="highlight">family</span> strengthening aspects of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that honourable senators have to take account of the fact that provided reasonable protection is given to any party to a marriage which has broken down, we have to acknowledge the fact that social mores are changing and that more and more women in fact are undertaking lives which are independent of the home, of their <span class="highlight">family</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer those people who believe that the Bill is inadequate because it does not deal with the whole range of <span class="highlight">family</span> law to page 35 of the report of the Senate Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the proposals for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is in this area that we get the final rounding off of the legislative provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> law at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council be strengthened and given extensive powers to advise the Parliament on the improvements which are required in the law in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first proposal of the Committee is that the body which is established in the Bill, as it stands at present, should not be merely an advisory agency but should have a broad and continuing role in reviewing the operation of the Act and directing attention, in a formal way, to all matters which are relevant to a sound <span class="highlight">family</span> law system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘to all matters which are relevant to a sound <span class="highlight">family</span> law system’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that in any case there is any disrespect or lack of feeling for the <span class="highlight">family</span> or for marriage- quite the reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that it will be the first of further measures which will look to the strengthening of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It assisted me, a senator encountering the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill for the first time, enormously in my appreciation of the problems, of the need for change, and of the potential of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will agree that in some ways it cannot truly be called a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Sydney City Mission, the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span> and agencies of this kind that at the present time are quite unhappy about the setup of the Australian Assistance Plan and about the possibilities of their participating in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of grave concern and of some distress to me that this great <span class="highlight">family</span> of Australian people which is spread right across the country is placed in the hands of a Minister who could not care less about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some time now I have been making a series of representations to the Minister on behalf of a <span class="highlight">family</span> in the United Kingdom who wanted a second assisted passage to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that arrangements would be made for his Department to get in touch with the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the United Kingdom, and that in due course arrangements would be made for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to travel to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was so pleased with the result of my representations that I arranged with my office in Adelaide to send an urgent telegram to the relatives of this <span class="highlight">family</span> in Adelaide acquainting them of the good news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Within an hour my secretary received a telephone call in which she was advised that the <span class="highlight">family</span> from the United Kingdom had been in Australia for a month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  came to Adelaide to speak at the 25th anniversary of the Good Neighbour Council in South Australia he laid great emphasis on the fact that <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion was to be the great cornerstone of Australia’s immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For 3 years I have been working on a case concerning a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, but nobody knows now where the papers are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are opposed to such action on the grounds that there has been ample time to discuss the bill with the community, and we are informed and believe that many submissions have been considered by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee and the report of that committee is substantially in accord with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to the low placement on the Senate notice paper of the further consideration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and the higher priority to be given to some other Bills of lesser urgency recently received from the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, the Australian Legal Aid Office -  will provide, broadly stated, will be: first, a general problem solving service of advice and assistance short of litigation to persons with an element of financial need- this will, in my view, take care of some 90 per cent of all problems that worry the ordinary citizen; and secondly, the conduct of litigation, particularly <span class="highlight">family</span> law, environmental and other litigation in areas of special concern to the Australian Government, on behalf of persons who cannot afford the cost  of representation  in court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Office took over responsibility for matters arising under Federal law, also <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law matters, or Matrimonial Causes Act matters, as the title now stands, and matters in relation to persons for whom the Australian Governmet concedes it has a special responsibility, and if Victoria got a fair share of the cake so far as the $1.3m is concerned, where would there be any continuing basis for obscurity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involves an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> in my own district which moved into a house some 4 to 41/2 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> had hoped, in fact they were told at the time, that when they wanted to purchase the house they would be able to purchase it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition, this <span class="highlight">family</span> had to find some $2,000 for a deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it is doubly hard for Aborigines who almost invariably come within the lowest income group and frequently have to provide for a <span class="highlight">family</span> larger than average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an Aboriginal living in the Townsville area- I am prepared to make his name available if anybody wishes to know it, although I do not wish to mention it publicly because it might embarrass him or his <span class="highlight">family</span>- who for a long period of time under the Act was able to put money away in a bank account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can do nothing more than create further emotional and <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption and probably destroy the painstaking work of years on the part of the families, the Presbyterian Church and my Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, who have done all possible to assist in the transitional stage of urban living which the people voluntarily undertook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, such a concept of marriage will destroy the contractual nature of marriage, undermine the total commitment of two persons to each other and threaten the integrity of <span class="highlight">family</span> life which is the basis of our society; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should vote against the Bill in its present form, allow public consideration of amendments and then vote to so amend the Bill as to strengthen and support marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> in a manner acceptable to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we have read the petitions concerning the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and support the bill as sufficiently protecting the legal and social rights of women and children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed to such action on the grounds that there has been ample time to discuss the bill with the community, and we are informed and believe that many submissions have been considered by Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee and the report of that Committee is substantially in accord with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there is such urgent need for reform that there must be no delay in presenting the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 to Parliament for debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That dissolution of marriage must come out of the legal system with people resolving their <span class="highlight">family</span> matters between themselves according to guidelines and with assistance of a mediator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-We are all, I think, most anxious to spend the balance of our life on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, but I wanted briefly to thank the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  for giving me some additional information on the financing of the Australian National Airlines Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Senate that for all that many honourable senators have said, women in Australia today are not equal and it is not the province of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, this Bill being basically a divorce BUI, to determine the status of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said a minute ago that in fact the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI can only reflect the situation of women and children in society today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so long as governments have not taken all the necessary measures to make that possible then we must not, via the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, abandon those individuals who have been brought up to be dependent, who have been expected to be dependent, who have been conditioned to be dependent and who are capable of being nothing but dependent because of all those pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our society officially rates the economic contribution to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the wife and mother at home at $7 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The woman who stays at home and who contributes to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and to the economy of the <span class="highlight">family</span> through what we call home duties occupies an economic role far greater than that which is given official recognition through the laws of our land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has some effect on the taxation situation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> but a relatively minor one when we are talking about a deduction that is worth only $7 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, all families find that the price to the <span class="highlight">family</span> in money terms of the mother or the wife going out to work is much higher than it is to keep her at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of feeding the <span class="highlight">family</span> where the wife and mother goes out to work inevitably rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of clothing that <span class="highlight">family</span> inevitably rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the woman working outside the home is very high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that she has made enormous economic sacrifice during the years she has been out of the work force for the sake of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and she will continue to make an economic sacrifice, whether she wishes to or not, by virtue of having been out of the work force through those years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the facts of working life in Australia and, in justice, they must be considered by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court or whichever court considers this Bill or any future Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was considered quite normal in those days for girls to work in the home and assist their mothers to bring up the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span> until such time as they married- the assumption being that all girls married wisely and well, an assumption which has never been borne out by the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, although there has been some provision for the protection of the weaker members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, before the courts or the police would act a man would virtually have to break his wife’s leg and all but kill her before anybody would move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt at all that a broken home, a home in which divorce has taken place, in which there is only one parent, leads to problems for the children of that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all else, because it is the key to anybody’s concern with a Bill relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span> or divorce, we have to give the means for justice and a decent life to the really innocent parties- the children of those broken down marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is debating the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill  1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every society throughout this world the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and the fundamental unit of that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, every society seeks to maintain and to strengthen the <span class="highlight">family</span> by a wide range of laws laying down the duties and responsibilities of the spouses of that marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions as to what shall constitute marriage, what shall constitute the <span class="highlight">family</span> and what shall constitute the dissolution of marriage and as to the other clauses are decisions that should be made in a sociological sense and not primarily, or totally in this case, in a legal sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I give notice that at an appropriate time I will move that a Senate select committee should be set up to inquire into all methods of maintaining and strengthening the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill purports to strengthen the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators on both sides of the chamber are really sincere about wanting an opportunity to look at marriage, even before it is contracted, and to look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> in all its affairs in life they will support the setting up of such a select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That select committee would be enabled to call upon the whole community- the whole community; not just lawyers- and invite the whole community to come forward with sociological, religious and other ideas to buttress the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because in my judgment this Bill does not do that- it is in itself a dissolution Bill and not a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill- I propose in due course to move for the setting up of such a select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> law in its great bulk is not a Commonwealth matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> law in its great bulk is to be found in the great body of State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect, it is humbug and hypocrisy to give the title ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUT to a Bill which does not seek to mention more than a fraction of the ingredients of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and which is in itself a marriage dissolution Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, let us call it by its proper name; let us call it a divorce law BUI and not a <span class="highlight">family</span> law BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> law, as I have said, is basically a matter for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In West Germany the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law which was published in 1971, provides for a divorce on the application of one or both parties if the marriage has broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is just a run round of the kind of society which in our view and thinking might look to our valuesthe Roman law, the Judeo-Christian ethic; the kind of values of home and <span class="highlight">family</span> which we have grown used to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that in every society the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the key institution, that every society recognises marriage, that every society makes laws to strengthen marriage, and that the test of our marriage laws or our divorce laws should be how it operates in that context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, when time permits I will move for the setting up of a Senate select committee to inquire into all means of maintaining and strengthening the <span class="highlight">family</span> so that we can really have an honest look at buttressing the <span class="highlight">family</span> rather than fragmenting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe and accept the fact that if a marriage can be proved conclusively to have broken down irretrievably, it should be dissolved as quickly as is possible, with the minimum of bitterness and with the maximum of equity to the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to do some very heavy thinking in terms of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court has about it the same enticing sound and seductive ring that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has in title, but to give something a title does not give it an effective function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to fumble along, clause by clause, considering this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court without being able to make a thorough test of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think, of course, that it is a good and trendy thing to talk about <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore if we are, to use a quaint Australianism, fair dinkum about wanting good <span class="highlight">family</span> law, wanting conciliation, wanting to restore marriages, wanting to help families, we will clearly have to make a new and vigorous study of all phases of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and we will have to look to see how we can help the <span class="highlight">family</span> from its very earliest stages, even from premarriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have to look so that fewer people come to the court, whether a <span class="highlight">family</span> law court or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That yardstick must be the evaluation of the legislation in terms of its contribution to the dignity and the security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no matter how important and how true those phrases may be, and no matter how impressive they may be, in the consideration of this Bill we must not let them override the matter of ultimate importance which relates to the contribution of the legislation to the strength of the marriage contract and to the strength of the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be the province and objective of legislation which we ultimately approve to firm the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, to preserve the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as basic to our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law that we must view the real importance of the legislation before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not tend to drive the thin edge of a wedge into a situation that may destroy the concept, perhaps unwittingly, of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as being a supreme unit in the Australian society, as indeed it is in many societies around the world, and as it has been for some thousands of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill concerns itself with what it describes as <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no query about the suggestion that there should be <span class="highlight">family</span> law in our community- I believe there is- and that it is a most important area of law in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The yardstick in this circumstance must be the promotion of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic facets of a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Whitlam  referred to children of that time as being brought up in a kibbutz style situation, as children of the community rather than as members of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make, I believe, a fundamental alteration to the very nature of the marriage contract and in doing so it must change the entire pattern of <span class="highlight">family</span> life in the Australian society and such major issues ought to receive the careful assessment of all the members of our community in the light of the best possible research and evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate is debating a very important measure described as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill sharply challenges us all boldly to examine all the circumstances relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> life and to recognise that as problems arise they should be examined and, what is more, they should be examined frankly and properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should under no circumstances be disguised or overlooked and there should be no pretense that the problems that arise in <span class="highlight">family</span> life and in <span class="highlight">family</span> law do not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure is described as a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> law, as I understand it, is the law which governs the relationships between men and women and parents and children and particularly when that relationship is governed by the institution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be true to say that <span class="highlight">family</span> law should be more concerned with relationships and their retention than, say, with individual issues which might happen to be in conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suppose the areas covered by <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation could be said to include the establishment of marriage and the dissolution of marriage, the wellbeing and the protection of children and the maintenance of affected persons in this relationship, the arrangements connected with property and all of the legal consequences that are similarly connected with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone making any study of this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and its related areas turns naturally to what any one or any group of Christian churches might say on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there are children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, their welfare in all its aspects becomes the prime consideration in any decision regarding the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of civil authorities to provide an ordered procedure for the dissolution in law of a broken marriage and to ensure that such a dissolution will be effected only after all possibility of reconciliation has been exhausted and after satisfactory arrangements have been made for the welfare of any children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This document is being revised at present, but I set out this selection, which is only a selection, because I believe that in looking at this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill we should promote the qualities of judgment, pardon, direction and promise, as well as encouraging the spirit of repentance and the virtue of forgiveness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Bill before us demands the very closest scrutiny because nothing affects the nation’s life and happiness so much as laws governing marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern has been expressed that the attitude of society to marriage may change if divorce is made too easy and that the stability of marriage and thus of the <span class="highlight">family</span> may be seriously undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reconciliation provisions should be an integral part of a good <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am greatly attracted by the  reference  in the Standing Committee’s report in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to the evidence given by  Mr Justice  Burnett of Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his submission he referred to the establishment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke about the first 12 months of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken the opportunity of visiting the <span class="highlight">family</span> court in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest that the <span class="highlight">family</span> court as it exists in South Australia is the kind of court envisaged in the reference of the Standing Committee but on the other hand, in the first 12 months of its operation it has provided a very good pattern of how <span class="highlight">family</span> courts may proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The surroundings of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court in Adelaide are particularly attractive and they provide for informality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is one of very great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a day when we are entering strongly into discussions upon economics, social welfare, foreign affairs and things of this kind, time spent on discussion of marriage, divorce and <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare may seem a little out of context for this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The home may refer to a <span class="highlight">family</span>, large or small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the matter of the Bill the stability of the home unit, represented either by a couple or by a <span class="highlight">family</span>, is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are many aspects of home stability, and one of these may be laid at the door of personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships are sound and known to be sound, the influence they extend will also be sound and beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sound <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship certainly starts with love and affection but, as the years develop, the situation can change and alter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there must be an accelerated and intensified program of education in studies of marriage, studies of successful home and <span class="highlight">family</span> life and studies of human relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we have then to find a way of communicating to people before marriage that in addition to being husband and wife they also must be friends for, as the years mature and success or disappointment occur or the interests of the <span class="highlight">family</span> extend, changes in relationship can occur and, as adulthood influences behaviour, this characteristic of friendship between one person and another, in addition to their being husband and wife, will undoubtedly preserve the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come finally in my contribution to this discussion on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of those indicate a variety of views on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI is to go onto the statute book it should go on with as wide an acceptance as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI has been one of the most important exercises undertaken by this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the motion for the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI not because I happen to be a member of a political party or a representative of a political party in this place but because of how in my lifetime I have come to understand human relationships and the need for marriage and divorce to be dealt with in such a way as to remove the areas of unhappiness, frustration and indignity which have been a characteristic of such human relationships in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI is a humane and important piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in 1971  Senator Murphy  was able to persuade the Senate to refer to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs the following matter: The law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters with particular regard to oppressive delays, costs, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it was not until the first session after the double dissolution that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was presented to this Parliament for its consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy has throughout insisted that our work upon the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and other reforms reflect the well known criteria set down in England in 1966 which I slightly paraphrase to state- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good <span class="highlight">family</span> law should buttress, rather than undermine, the stability of marriage; where a marriage has irretrievably broken down, the legal shell should be destroyed with the maximum fairness, and the minimum bitterness, distress and humiliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is about <span class="highlight">family</span> conflicts- not divorce; it therefore deals with the welfare of children, maintenance, property, protection of the marriage and the people involved therein (by injunction if necessary), marriage counselling, on going help in custody and access problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence its true title, a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message that is being told from the pulpit and amongst groups of Christians, particularly in the Sydney region, is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will basically alter the whole concept of marriage in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That indicates the politicisation that took place at a meeting that we called for the purpose of discussing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does no good to the community or to those who have a reasonable and logical position to express in respect of the far-reaching consequences of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are being led to believe by the campaign that has been waged that we are making divorce easier and that in fact we are about to destroy the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and the sanctity of the marriage contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak in support of the amendment to defer the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 until the autumn sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until recently our way of life has been support for the free enterprise system, the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and individual freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is being attacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is now gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer can a father afford to clothe, house and feed a <span class="highlight">family</span> out of his earnings, so the wife has to help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to tell the Senate about <span class="highlight">family</span> life under the socialist system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a little bit of background information that honourable senators should know in order to understand <span class="highlight">family</span> life in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is allowed to visit the child on Sunday, which is not our idea of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The father may be sent to one part of the country to work and the mother to another part, so <span class="highlight">family</span> life is disrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the occasions when a child is allowed home, the child comes home not only for perhaps the joys of whatever <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion there is but also to criticise the parents to ascertain whether they are backsliding against the Party line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about <span class="highlight">family</span> life in a socialist state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Young people want instruction in such knotty matters as insurance whether it be health, personal or property, budgeting, taxation banking, existing welfare services, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do agree that it will alter our whole outlook on the institution of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life but I think we must have the courage to face up to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the provisions of the Bill have been extended by the 3 lots of amendments on the 3 occasions it has been submitted and debated and now covers a lot more ground, it still can hardly be called a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill is without doubt one of the most important pieces of legislation that have come before this Parliament because it deals with the basic structure of our society, that is, the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have discussed this aspect with many clerics and people associated with <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling in my State of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps there could be an amendment to provide for greater opportunity for <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling by experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could well be brought within the concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee emphasises that provisions must be drawn in such a way as to encourage parties whose marriages or <span class="highlight">family</span> lives are in difficulty to come and take advantage of the marriage counselling facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court at any time - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately these children can be badly hurt and embarrassed by the exposure of the traumas and the tragedies of their <span class="highlight">family</span> life over which they have no control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I desire to say a few words about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basis of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to call the Bill a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill, but its commencement and completion is in relation to divorce- the breaking down of marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill, even with many of the suggested amendments, becomes law- <span class="highlight">family</span> law as it is calledfamily life, the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, will be greatly altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament will be culpable or praised for the results on <span class="highlight">family</span> life in Australia in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is our strongest link with happiness, prosperity and development of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secular interests of a variety of types will be affected by, and are interested in, the results of the decision ultimately of this Parliament in respect of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because I am not a conservative in social legislation I do admit that every 15 to 20 years legislation such as this- we called it ‘matrimonial causes’ earlier, now we call it ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> law’needs to be amended to change with the mores of the people, and the mores of the people change as the years roll on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mercurial mind got busy and we now have the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rarely in my 20 years of parliamentary life have I had more unemotional and considered representations from a greater variety of people and from a greater variety of interests than I have had in respect of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, and I presume this would apply to all other honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another important reason why the Senate’s attention should be taken away from considering the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because I think it is relevant in a debate such as this to indicate what the policy of the Liberal Party, as expressed in its platform, states with regard to matrimonial law, <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Liberal Party, in the platform which has recently been canvassed by all sections of what is a grass roots organisation throughout Australia, states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is a cohesive force in society and the Liberal Party recognises the necessity for strengthening its influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberals acknowledge the vital contribution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the development of the individual and, if the <span class="highlight">family</span> is having difficulty fulfilling that task, the community must come to its aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising the effect of adverse or changing economic  circumstances on the performance of this role, the Liberal Party advocates by consultation and co-operation between the Commonwealth and States the following means of assisting the <span class="highlight">family</span> to meet the stresses and challenges of modern society- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are set out 8 items which represent the ways in which the Liberal Party would seek to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education for marriage; guidance on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and the responsibilities of <span class="highlight">family</span> life to give effective support for the harmony and continuity of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encouragement to the <span class="highlight">family</span> to ensure the full development of each child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision of a suitable environment, the development of community amenities, education and health services, and the opportunity to obtain suitable housing as essential prerequisites of a sound <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child care and other suitable facilities to supplement <span class="highlight">family</span> care when necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fostering community spirit and activities to enable the <span class="highlight">family</span> to be part of a living community rather than finding itself isolated in populous urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the question of matrimonial law and <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, this is what the Liberal Party platform states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party recognises the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the value of the personal relationships involved in marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such laws must be just and effective and give due consideration to the needs of all members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foster community organisations which assist people to prepare for and understand the complexities of married life, and to resolve marital difficulties with a view to maintaining <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establishing, in co-operation with State Governments, uniform <span class="highlight">family</span> law throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establish and develop well staffed <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to deal with marital disharmony, divorce and all ancillary matters, with primary emphasis on reconciliation and the welfare of children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove disabilities imposed on children born outside marriage and establish just entitlements for parties to longstanding <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships outside marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the fundamental group unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stated starkly in those terms I think the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is scarcely recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span>, throughout mankind’s history, has been the focal point and the stimulus for the development of succeeding generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> of today, styled in the modern day language as the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>, is not the <span class="highlight">family</span> of yesteryear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, with a complex interdependent society, evolved the concept of a smaller <span class="highlight">family</span> essentially consisting of a mother and father and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is not the <span class="highlight">family</span> which comprised the living antecedents and the living decendants of an essential <span class="highlight">family</span> core whether it be matriarchal or patriarchal <span class="highlight">family</span> of yesteryear We have today a <span class="highlight">family</span> which, I believe, is the absolutely essential core of our JudeoChristian tradition and I believe that that <span class="highlight">family</span> ought to be preserved and that as far as legislation is able to sustain the <span class="highlight">family</span>, legislation should enable that <span class="highlight">family</span> to provide for those who are part of it all that our society can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having accepted that view of the <span class="highlight">family</span> I believe that marriage in our society is fundamental to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the cornerstone of the modern day <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weaken respect for marriage, regard it as easily and opportunistically dissolvable, remove the lawful backing for the mutuality of obligations and promote the independence or separateness of the parties to the marriage and their children and I believe that we are threatening the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and its stabilising influence in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say for my part is that we will have a totally different society if we undermine the institution of marriage and if we challenge the fabric of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and put in its place not a concept which has been developed or which is understood by those who I believe are breaking down what we have at present but simply a society in which there are no stabilising elements and in which there are none of those fundamental characteristics which I have always believed to characterise our present society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children are the persons who derive most benefit from the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They suffer most in the breakdown of a marriage and a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, there have been in support of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill some 99 petitions representing approximately 11,000 signatures, and against the Bill, or seeking a delay of the Bill, there have been 133 petitions with almost 20,000 signatures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Divorce and <span class="highlight">family</span> law are a matter upon which everybody has some experience and an issue upon which everybody feels more or less capable of expressing a view which ought to be listened to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever Parliament ought to give time for consideration of measures it is on a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill or a divorce Bill such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, of course, the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill introduced on 1 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have with that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill a useful explanatory memorandum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then have at some later stage- I think it was the end of October or the beginning of Novermber- a document entitled <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974, Consolidation of Amendments and New Clauses (To be moved by the Attorney-General).’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As other speakers have said, it is a document which contains 92 amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974, Statement by the Attorney-General,  Senator the  Honourable Lionel Murphy, Q.C., on amendments to be moved by him ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we had a tremendously useful document headed ‘Showing differences between the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1 974 as introduced in the Senate on 1 August 1974 and that Bill as it would appear if the amendments to be moved by the AttorneyGeneral were incorporated in it. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then finally we have a useful document headed ‘Revised memorandum showing the differences between the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1 974 as introduced in the Senate on 1 August 1974 and that Bill as it would appear if the amendments to be moved by the Attorney-General were incorporated in it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment relates to the incorporation in the Bill of provisions to establish a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which, freed of the rigidity and formality of conventional courts, would be able to exercise jurisdiction over the whole range of ‘<span class="highlight">family</span>’ matters with dignity, informality, expedition and comparative lack of expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is of the opinion that the establishment of such a Court is an essential supplement to the change from a concept of ‘fault’ in divorce grounds to one of irretrievable breakdown evidenced by separation and that the ultimate well-being of all involved in ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> ‘ differences, including children, will be fostered by such a judicial institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because I would welcome the concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts- not a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in the Commonwealth sense but <span class="highlight">family</span> courts in the State sense in which to the one body one could go with problems and questions prior to marriage, problems which arose during a marriage and any one of the many problems which arise in regard to the dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept was elaborated in the final report of the Committee when at pages 16 and following reference was made to a <span class="highlight">family</span> court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is firmly of the opinion that this Part requires substantial redrafting to incorporate the creation under the Bill of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, a <span class="highlight">family</span> court of record, being invested with the full jurisdiction of the Commonwealth under section 51 of the Constitution (viz. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marriage, divorce and matrimonial causes) and dealing exclusively with <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that the new Court exercise not only the remedies in relation to matrimonial causes now exercised in State Supreme Courts and Territory Courts but maintenance, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> property jurisdictions presently exercised in a variety of State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in some way this issue as to whether there is constitutional power can be raised for consideration before it is acted upon- supposing that the clauses go through- I think that a lot of the problems in the future can be resolved, because it would be absolutely disastrous to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> court established as a Commonwealth court of record in which the decisions made by that court were not sustained by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who relied upon the decision they had received in that <span class="highlight">family</span> court would find that they could not rely upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that if <span class="highlight">family</span> courts were created by the States that problem would not arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought from a host of considerations that the concept of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts is a much better concept than that of a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court is derived from American experience we ought to look at what America has done and in particular, because I see him as an adviser in this chamber at the moment, at that admirable report made some years ago by an officer of the Attorney-General’s Department,  Mr Yuill,  in which the various <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and the differences in concept from State to State in the United States were elaborated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have the same constitutional framework as America has but we ought to recognise that there are different types of <span class="highlight">family</span> court structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of a ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> court’ is well established in the United States of America, Canada and Japan though there are variations in the proceedings and powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It generally involves the creation of a special court (or division of a larger court), the assimilation of all <span class="highlight">family</span> matters into one court, with active pre-divorce and post-divorce counselling not merely to assist reconciliation, but also to provide for the reduction of bitterness and distress and in alleviating ongoing post-divorce problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is concerned with the effect on the creation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court and the appointment of judges of Section 72 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which in general requires judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court created by Parliament to be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I read elsewhere in this report, the <span class="highlight">family</span> court is to be a superior court of record, there is no question of in general judges being appointed for life; it is a matter of law and constitutional requirement that every judge of a Federal Court should be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we would then be faced with would be a <span class="highlight">family</span> court with I do not know how many extra judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have adverted to this aspect of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court structure because the Attorney-General has by and large, as I read his amendments, accepted the recommendations of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In place of his own initial views he now believes that there should be a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had it assessed to me that approximately one-quarter or more of the existing work of the supreme courts of the States would have to be vested in this <span class="highlight">family</span> court under the provisions which are contemplated by  Senator Murphy,  which would mean that there would be an excess of judges in the State courts with not sufficient work to occupy them full time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That we have examined the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and substantially support the provisions therein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should vote against the Bill in its present form, allow public consideration of amendments and then vote to so amend the Bill as to strengthen and support marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> in a manner acceptable to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the Bill was introduced on Tuesday no urgency was given to the matter and the day was taken up by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill despite my request on behalf of the Opposition that urgency be given to the Local Government Grants Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today the Bill has been listed to follow the Committee stage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is willing to adjourn the Committee consideration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill at 6 p.m. and will give the Opposition from 8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. the Opposition undertakes to pass the Local Government Grants Bill tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-One of the things that is curious is that the honourable senator asks that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill be postponed until after consideration of these other measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill should be dealt with and if the endeavours of some members of the Opposition to try to frustrate the progress of this measure are persevered with, at least the country will be told just what they are about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask those opposite not to persevere with some kind of endeavour to filibuster on other matters or protract the business of the Senate to prevent the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill being dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition was put not to deal with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My proposal is that it is understood that at 9 p.m. we would adjourn the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and deal with the Local Government Grants Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act may be cited as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Clause 1, Leave out ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1974’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that to use the name ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act’ is humbug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a Bill to preserve and aid the <span class="highlight">family</span> within the framework of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act’ seems to me to be a singularly inappropriate name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense to have a Bill which enables the quick and easy dissolution of marriage tied to the <span class="highlight">family</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To link <span class="highlight">family</span> life in the concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill with divorce seems to me to defame all that is good in marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence marriage is tied to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> life is the greatest gift that God has given to mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> life, of necessity, has a whole wide perimeter and the very least of it seems to me to be the easy and quick, almost by the press of a button, concept of the dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill only touches the fringe of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not right for the innocent to be able to look at the BUI and think that it deals with the whole concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick,  when speaking at the second reading stage of the Bill, said that all the various laws concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span> are to be found almost entirely in State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beyond doubt that the description of this Bill as a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill is completely confusing to all because the great bulk of <span class="highlight">family</span> law lies within the individual States, and will remain so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Bill was called the ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Life Bill’ they might have a point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill certainly does not cover all aspects of <span class="highlight">family</span> life; it deals with the aspects of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable senators will find that it is what is known as ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> law’ when studied in universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in no way is that the complete essence of this Bill or is it a fact that it is incorrect to call the Bill the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> law covers the areas where the law has to intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-About making the facilities of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court available to people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said during the second reading debate, <span class="highlight">family</span> law is the law which governs the relationships between men and women and parents and children, and particularly when those relationships are instituted by marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that, as we embark upon the Bill and the many amendments to be debated, it should always be kept in mind that the ultimate aim of the Bill is the protection and preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> according to law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think that the title ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’ meets the needs of the situation and I oppose the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were concerned with <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been discussed in public and it is known as the ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People know what they are talking about when they refer to it as the ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I find myself in a difficult position because I do not think the Bill is aptly described by the title ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why I object to the expression <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act’ is probably the reason that it was considered in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances I imagine the description ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’ has been chosen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the other hand I think it has at the present time features which I regard as not exactly destructive of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> but certainly conducive to weakening the impact in society and the acceptance in our society of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no power to make laws with respect to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might have to make separate applications under the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act- a de novo type of application- for maintenance or custody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’ includes Norfolk Island; court’, in relation to any proceedings, means the court exercising jurisdiction in those proceedings by virtue of this Act; court of summary jurisdiction’ includes a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of a State or Territory, not being a court that may be constituted by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; decree’ means decree, judgment or order, and includes a decree nisi and an order dismissing an application or refusing to make a decree or order; financial matters’, in relation to the parties to a marriage, means matters with respect to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause ( 1 ) insert the following new definition: <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court’ means the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were objection to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court we could come back to this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Committee took the view that it did not want a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court we could come back and delete the definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard the definition of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, as contemplated by  Senator Murphy’s  amendment, as, in my judgment, probably the most significant provision of all the provisions in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I indicated in the course of my contribution to the second reading debate that I am totally opposed not to the concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> court but to the concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court established under Commonwealth law, with judges appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to the title of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, I think that my Tasmanian colleague,  Senator Everett,  read out the long title which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with all sorts of <span class="highlight">family</span> situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just a contradiction in terms to say that marriage according to law in Australia is a union for life when, in fact, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill into which we now propose to insert this definition provides for dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we could have, for example, what is called a testator’s <span class="highlight">family</span> maintenance application- the question of whether or not a proper will has been made under which the surviving spouse or a child has an appropriate order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is cautious legislation in a federation such as ours not to assume- particularly in the matter of <span class="highlight">family</span> relationshipstoo much power where there is doubt as to whether that power exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would remove what is desirable, namely the power for persons to be able to approach the court- let us hope that it is a <span class="highlight">family</span> courtwithout having to start matrimonial proceedings for divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attempt to take maintenance out of that jurisdiction and to put it into, I hope, a <span class="highlight">family</span> court- I hope that there will be both Federal and State involvement- would be lost if this amendment were carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there is very little reason for thinking that these powers will be denied by application to the High Court, and we should not fear to tread in the directions in which this Bill is pointed and in which common <span class="highlight">family</span> law should prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very valuable work on this precise subject- the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to regulate <span class="highlight">family</span> relations- by Professor Sackville, who is known to all honourable senators, and by Professor Howard, who is the General Counsel to the Attorney-General, is reported in the 1974 Federal Law Review at page 30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is referred to in the text of ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law in Australia’ by Finlay, Bishop and Johnson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad and bold concept of this legislation is that at the appropriate time all such proceedings would come under the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or any variant of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court as it is at present conceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is felt that under a <span class="highlight">family</span> court set-up there can be greater benefit for the party for whom the solicitor or counsel is appearing, undoubtedly these provisions will be availed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as State courts are concerned, it has still to be decided how a <span class="highlight">family</span> court set up by the Commonwealth can live with State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Missen  has an amendment to the effect that there shall be State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are to be State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, surely they would be able to handle matters which arise out of the marital relationship, whether they are matrimonial causes or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the advantage of having State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts instead of a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this wide definition which covers maintenance cases now heard by State courts is not included there is no guarantee that the States will put such powers into the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest that all these powers should be put within the ambit of matrimonial cause and should be transferred, in my opinion and the opinion of some members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in many cases to the State courts, which are to be known as <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a passage from the text which I mentioned earlier, ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law in Australia’ by Finley, Bissert and Johnson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is <span class="highlight">family</span> law-  on the ground that laws on marriage and divorce and allied matters are of national rather than merely regional importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be a cause of complaint that someone may raise the issue of whether matters are to be dealt with in a <span class="highlight">family</span> court or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are taking the bold step of moving <span class="highlight">family</span> matters- matrimonial causes- into the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone says: ‘I contend that this is a <span class="highlight">family</span> court matter, ‘ I suppose it is the same as in any other area, such as in relation to industrial matters which would be taken in the industrial court and not elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will be the court in which proceedings are to be taken for such a matrimonial cause if, for example, the parties reside in a country centre where there is no available supreme court, where there is not likely to be a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court and where a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court may not be constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the argument on the last provision that there will be a court, be it a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court or a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court, which will contain within its scope the means of dealing with all these matrimonial causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As time goes on one hopes that the <span class="highlight">family</span> court, or whatever it may be, will be the one which will have jurisdiction in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the relevance or justification of a case which has been urged by so many people today- that to have the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court structure and to have the ability to go to these <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts is going to open up something new in this area if what people have to do is to go to the ordinary courts as they always have done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator would let me have a few moments to speak I could point out to him that there he will find that the Committee, whilst expressing the wish that all matters involving matrimonial causes should be heard in a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, faced the fact that for reasons of geography and manpower this desirable state will not emerge overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope, when this scheme gets off the ground, that magistrates will be excluded from matters concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span>, that we will have a two-tiered judicial system and that the court will be a circuit court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is that those courts be replaced by a <span class="highlight">family</span> court which will be phased in even to isolated spots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause (3) leave out ‘Superior’ insert ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the fact, for instance, that the Catholic <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau would like to start a training course in marriage counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness, and not in any way to stir up controversy but because I think I ought to tell the Senate, one of the complaints made to me by those who were associated with churches is that despite the expressed concern of a number of churches about the necessity to preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> it has been very difficult for their marriage guidance organisations to get any real financial assistance from the churches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the debate can help to make those who have funds pay out a little of those funds in accordance with what they see as the necessity of preserving the <span class="highlight">family</span> it may be of benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will notice that I have suggested- perhaps it is in line with  Senator Carrick  ‘s proposal, if I may be permitted to refer to it, and with other suggestionsan institute of <span class="highlight">family</span> studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that through such an institute some attention can be given to these topics, in addition to <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I am aware that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau went out of business in Sydney recently and many of its assets were taken over by the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span> has many diverse activities, only one of which is counselling, and I am sure that it is deserving of support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am well aware of the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span> case and the difficulties there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The collapse of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau, which was mentioned by the honourable senator, is an illustration of what I referred to a little earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot has been said in the community over the last 12 months or so about the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau, which was a well respected institution, gave plenty of notice that it was in grave financial difficulties and was allowed to collapse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just what are they doing in some of these areas, apart from talking about their fondness and concern for the <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things we also had in mind, in addition to the point raised by  Senator Button  on this matter, was that this <span class="highlight">family</span> court should be set up as an institution which will be different from traditional courts in which matters of this kind are heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be particularly valuable if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court is established with a different method of operating in a more informal way because in the existing Act 3 things can happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in fact if the parties are litigating some matter in the court whether it is the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or the existing court and they want that decision then to force them unwillingly to enter into a discussion with the judge is hardly a likely way to effect a reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee did hear evidence from Judge Burnett of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that although the judge will be steeped in the <span class="highlight">family</span> atmosphere he is really there as a judge to decide the things that cannot be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sensible judges who are steeped in the <span class="highlight">family</span> atmosphere will suggest that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts are there to help with good sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommends the insertion into Part III of the Bill of a provision to the effect that where an application for principal relief discloses that the parties to the marriage have been married for less than 2 years, the Registrar or other proper officer of the court must refer the application to a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I 4a (1) A party to a marriage may file in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court a notice stating that the marriage has broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where such a notice is filed, the Director of Counselling and Welfare of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court may arrange for the parties to the marriage to be interviewed by a marriage counsellor for the purpose of assisting the parties with a view to a reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director of Counselling and Welfare of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court may arrange for the parties to the marriage to be interviewed by a marriage counsellor for the purpose of assisting the parties with a view to a reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other or to the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) a party to a marriage may file in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court a notice stating that he or she intends to seek the assistance of the counselling facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, as the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  has said, the amendment is in accordance with the general view of the Standing Committee that the counselling services of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be available at as early a stage as possible and- this is most important- without necessarily invoking the jurisdiction of the court in respect of any particular proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that a party to a marriage may file in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court a notice stating that he or she intends to seek the assistance of the counselling facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I make is that the Committee considered that amendment was desirable in order to increase the constitutional strength of the power contained in the proposed new clause 14a- in other words, that the availability of the counselling facilities should be pursuant to a formal filing of a document invoking those facilities in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person wants to use the facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or of the Marriage Guidance Bureau he can do so under a subsequent proposed new clause which suggests that the Director of Counselling and Welfare is to advise where facilities may be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the view of the Senate Standing Committee, one of the incidental benefits of having proposed new clause 14a ( 1) in the Bill is that there will be taken a legal step which will bring matters before the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to spell out what the purposes of counselling are, should we include a few extra words to take in the meaning, say, ‘or for purposes of offering personal counselling which may be necessary to cope with the problems resulting from a disturbed <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I believe that it must be a long time in actual development because we are told that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court may be some time in actually being established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there will be people in remoter areas, removed from a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, who will not have the facilities which are offered by this clause readily available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Court may advertise the existence and availability of the counselling and welfare facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and of other courts having jurisdiction under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A party to a marriage may seek the assistance of the counselling facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and when such assistance is sought the Director of Counselling and Welfare shall, as far as practicable, make those facilities available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b) the counselling and welfare facilities available within the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed new heading ‘Part IIIa- The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to indicate at the outset that I am opposed to the concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will oppose any insertion in the Bill relating to a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and that would mean I object to this heading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, if the concept is accepted by the Committee the issue becomes whether or not the provisions to give effect to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are provisions which are appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the appropriate place to speak on this issue of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is when we are dealing with this particular question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended that there should be a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia which was to be a superior court of record, and that the jurisdiction ought to be vested in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then notice that 3 members of that Committee who have subscribed to the concept of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court also are putting up amendments which will facilitate the creation by the States, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the situation, there also is provision under their amendments whereby the jurisdiction may be vested in those State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that their view is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will exist alongside the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking up  Senator Everett’s  point, if agreements are not reached between the Commonwealth and the States, obviously there will not be State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts but there will be a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My fear is that there will not be State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts under this concept because this Commonwealth Government would not be interested in establishing State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that was a retrograde step and not as efficacious as State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts would be, constitutionally and practically, in giving effect to the purposes of the Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred yesterday to some aspects of the Committee’s report which I felt indicated that there was, if not a misconception, a view which I did not think was constitutionally sound and that was the view that in some way you may have judges of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court constituted by the Commonwealth who were not appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said then, and I think it is indisputable, that judges of a Commonwealth court, be it a Superior Court, be it the High Court, be it the Industrial Court or be it a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, are appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea of geriatric judges being judges of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court I think is totally inconsistent with the objectives which are sought in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Committee discussing the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or is it widening that discussion much further than I would have anticipated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are discussing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court but part of the problems which one can get involved in when one discusses this concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is the ability of the equipment of the judges who comprise the court, because there is a fear to which expression is given in the report about the age of judges and how desirable it is to avoid that situation developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I think that to establish a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is to create that situation and whilst various other means by other legislation may provide inducements by which judges might be persuaded not to continue their judicial role beyond a certain age, there is no guarantee whatever that judges will accept such inducements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a number of judges who, I think with general acceptance, perform their duties even though they are in their late seventies and some are in their eighties, but this is a concept which in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court area is not desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second aspect which I think is important is that a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court would in essence be another name for a Commonwealth Superior Court with all the arguments against a Superior Court being able to be argued against a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would require a separate type of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court circuit which would provide services as readily available to people in country areas as would be provided by existing Supreme Court circuits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the Government is willing to spend day after day on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill but will graciously allow about 90 minutes on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister for the Media inform the Senate whether the ViceChairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board,  Mr J.  E. Neary, holds shares in any companies having an interest or involvement in the broadcasting and entertainment media or whether any members of his immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> hold shares in such companies as a result of recent transfers by  Mr Neary  or prior issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, which took up 1 or 2 days, had not intruded into the debate last week I believe that when we went home at 10.30 p.m. last Thursday the notice paper would have been almost cleaned up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the notice paper at present, apart from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- which I understand will take some time to deal with- the rest of the Bills would not necessarily occupy much of the time of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to say a few words on this matter because undoubtedly the creation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, whether it be Federal entirely or State and Federal, is of great interest to the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, lt was, of course, a major part of the recommendations that that Committee put forward- that there certainly should be a <span class="highlight">family</span> court taking up all the jurisdictions which were otherwise spread in a great mass of courts, in different ways, and which were a constant cause of jumping from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the cause likewise of cost and of frustration for litigants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second aspect which I think is important is that a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court would in essence be another name for a Commonwealth Superior Court with all the arguments against a Superior Court being able to be argued against a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court means in any way the same thing as a Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from anything else the proposal for a Superior Court, which I strongly oppose, is a suggestion that we would merely put a certain part of the jurisdiction into one section of the Superior Court which would be called the ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be given certain powers and certain facilitiesthe sort that we would like to see given to all parts of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from anything else one of the proposals of the Superior Court Bill was that judges could be interchangeable between divisions of the Court and that they could move from one division- <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law- into another division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is completely contrary to the concept which the Committee had of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court because what is designed is that the people who will be appointed to a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be those who have a special touch for that sort of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known to the Senate that I and other members of the Committee propose to seek the creation of not only a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court but also of State courts that will operate along with the Commonwealth courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That requires us to have the uniformity which a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will bring because it will bring together on appeal and in other ways the concepts which are desired to be found in <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say that I certainly support the concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court being created as proposed in this Part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> court is not set up as a new concept, as a new court moving into a new field, it will be complete defeat for this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in the Senate on 1 7 September 1 974 I proposed to put before the Senate certain clauses for the setting up of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fully endorse paragraphs 33, 34 and 35 of the Standing Committee’s report and, in particular, the concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court as a ‘helping court’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the quality of justice in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters should be even-handed across Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not go further into the matter except to say that a separate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court away from the ordinary court buildings will provide a better atmosphere for the resolution of <span class="highlight">family</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will need to be men and women of compassion who have a deep understanding of the subtleties of human conduct and marital relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, along with  Senator Missen,  that the concept of an Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe such a Court will provide justice, compassion and help and put Australia in the forefront of <span class="highlight">family</span> law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot help feeling that some of those cases have been dealt with in almost the worst possible way, and certainly not in the manner in which these <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs ought to be handled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Committee will endorse the heading of this part and therefore the concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  asked why we wanted a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court instead of having merely State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reply to that question by saying that if the Committee accepts the idea that it is desirable that there should be a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to administer this area of law, the fact is that the only court that this Parliament can definitely establish is a Commonwealth court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States choose not to accept that invitation the Parliament is left with the proposition- this is if we went along with what  Senator Greenwood  said- that we are going to allow matrimonial causes to be administered by courts other than <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I would say, in answer to  Senator Greenwood,  that the situation is that we need to set up a Commonwealth court if we are to be certain that we are going to be able to have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the second reading debate I. made a comment about the place of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and  Senator James  McClelland indicated by way of interjection that some of the things I was hoping <span class="highlight">family</span> courts could achieve probably had no constitutional head of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were concerning me at that time were matters relating to juvenile delinquency and cases of that kind which ideally should be within the ambit of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the structure of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts throughout the world, the best of them seem to take in not just matrimonial causes but many other matters affecting children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a constitutional limit to what can be done by the Commonwealth I think we have a pretty strong argument for inviting the States to be involved in the setting up and operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other matters which should be dealt with in <span class="highlight">family</span> courts but this can only be done if the States are involved on a partnership basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I visualise the development within Australia of what I choose to call <span class="highlight">family</span> courts but they would have a wide range and adjudicate not only on matters arising out of the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship; they also would have the function of providing advice and counselling in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a <span class="highlight">family</span> court is really a useful centre pin upon which a lot of advice facilities for the community at large will develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real problem arises as to whether the Commonwealth has the power constitutionally to set up such a <span class="highlight">family</span> court with or without those additional facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress what I have said before, that there is no consolation in being able to say some years hence that these points were adverted to in the course of the Senate debate1 on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and those who were cautious find that they were right, if that should happen to be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read and re-read what the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs said about this matter of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find, with all respect to members of that Committee, that the argument and the logic are confused because it seems to me that the concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court is well expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it appears to me that there is the development of a concept of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accepts only the concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is good enough for  Senator Missen  to say that he is quite certain that a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts will work together and to assert that proposition without explaining how they will work together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But certainly, as far as court structures and functions are concerned, it is obligatory upon Parliament to lay down the functions of a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the functions of a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that journal there is an article by Professor Finlay on the <span class="highlight">family</span> court concept in the light of the absence in the original provisions of the legislation of such a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that the tenor of Professor Finlay ‘s article was one of criticism of the omission of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court from the original legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tentative picture of a new ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Court’ which emerges, however, is somewhat confused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is talking here about the <span class="highlight">family</span> law division of the Superior Court which was the original concept proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Superior Court whose work at first instance is to be the routine task of granting decrees of dissolution in undefended divorce proceedings will have attached to it the sophisticated apparatus that a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I interpolate that from my recollection that is what the Attorney-General said was a fair substitute for a <span class="highlight">family</span> court and that was why he did not, in his first Bill, establish a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the courts dealing with the really contentious aspects of <span class="highlight">family</span> conflict seem likely to remain the state courts of summary jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the Commonwealth could encourage the setting up of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts on a co-ordinated basis at State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone looking for a ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Court’ will therefore be disappointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the probable division of labour between the Superior Court and courts of summary jurisdiction be in inverse relationship to the intricacy of the respective subject matters with which they will be dealing, but important areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law will, for constitutional reasons remain outside the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drawing support from what Professor Finlay has said I emphasise that he recognised this constitutional limitation upon this concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> law which the Bill is not prepared to recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Bill asserts a jurisdiction for this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in matters of adoption and the guardianship, custody or maintenance of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talks about the problems relating to testator <span class="highlight">family</span> maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He uses the same example which  Senator Baume  used of juvenile courts and the fact that they cannot be within the area of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all of these factors are indications of some limitation upon the efficacy of a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court on a constitutional basis and in the area of jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To set up a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to visualise that as the court in which all these problems will be resolved must surely mean that people in country areas will be given the same facilities as people in city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court with lesser jurisdiction than the Superior <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the concept is to provide that access to the courts whether for <span class="highlight">family</span> matters or for other matters is reasonable and easy for the citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to this excellent article titled ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law, <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts and Federalism’,  Senator Greenwood  has read many excellent parts of that article but he neglected the conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such courts could be established as state <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and invested with all matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law within both federal and state power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Superior Court of Australia could be entrusted with appellate jurisdiction in <span class="highlight">family</span> matters within federal power, leaving only appeals in state <span class="highlight">family</span> matters to be dealt with by State Supreme Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a system of state <span class="highlight">family</span> courts administering predominantly federal law would have a twofold effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court proposed under this new Part and State courts proposed along the lines that Professor Finlay has advocated for some considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country tend to neglect it in the civil sphere, in the criminal sphere especially, and most of all in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone should be concerned about the almost trivial price one would have to pay if this proposed legislation can achieve a useful result in these <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those who have been expressing great concern for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> ought to be in support of the proposal to establish a <span class="highlight">family</span> court to deal with those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listening to what was put by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Greenwood)  I gathered that substantially he was saying: ‘Let us leave things as they are and deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters in much the same atmosphere as you deal with other matters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that one of the things a <span class="highlight">family</span> court would want to do would be to get right away from the area of the other courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could imagine a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in a building which was away from the criminal and civil courts and away altogether from that atmosphere without us having even to build new premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked about matters which were not capable of being dealt with by the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event this is a large step forward and that is enough without having to tackle the question, which has not proved easy of solution elsewhere, whether we should combine juvenile delinquency with other <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other matters such as the testator’s <span class="highlight">family</span> maintenance matters, are traditionally, even in the States which have made some progress in dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters, not dealt with in a <span class="highlight">family</span> atmosphere but in equity courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly that is so in New South Wales and these cases may be regarded only marginally as <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave aside the question raised by  Senator Missen  and invite him to reconsider the passage he read from Professor Finlay ‘s article because clearly what Professor Finlay is there saying, and also says in the final paragraph of the article, is that he looks for a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court as part of the co-operative federalism which he believes is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refers to ‘a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court administering Federal law’, which is the argument which I feel ought to prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed new clause of the Bill establishing a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court is not what Professor Finlay is there looking to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that he never visualised that there would be a <span class="highlight">family</span> court set up by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Committee stated in a passage I read during the second reading debate that it was concerned with the effect on the creation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court and the appointment of judges and of section 72 of the Commonwealth Constitution which, in general, requires judges of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court created by Parliament to be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that much of the work which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, as set up by the Commonwealth, is proposing to do will not be within the concept of an exercise of judicial power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this concept of a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court develops so matters will go into that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand also that this concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, coming as it does as an amendment at a late stage- it is only within the last fortnight to 3 weeks that the amendment for this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has been circulated- has not been worked out in co-operation with State or Territory judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, from what I have been told, that this will envisage some 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the work which is currently exercised by the State supreme courts moving into the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite him again, if he would, to address himself to the point which  Senator Baume  raised and which I raise and which I think is an important matter- the matters which ought to be the concern of any <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will not be able to be the concern of any <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(1) A court, to be known as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, is created by this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(1) A court, to be known as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, is created by this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that a proper basis on which to decide what the size of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see a situation in which it may be necessary to appoint an additional judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court at fairly short notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that 6 judges- it is only one per State- would be a completely bare minimum, so far as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is concerned if it is to achieve the purposes that the Attorney-General has conceived for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that for other reasons I was not in the chamber when the Committee discussed the previous amendment, the result of which now is that the AttorneyGeneral can proceed to establish the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court with a chief judge and 6 other judges, but he must prescribe by regulation what other judges will be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of how many judges will be necessary is linked also with the question of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, if they are created, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by reason of training, experience and personality, he is a suitable person to deal with the matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person may hold office at the one time as a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and as a judge of another court, or of two or more other courts, created by the Parliament but, if a judge of another court or courts created by the Parliament is appointed as a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, he is not, while he receives salary or annual allowance as a judge of that other court or courts, entitled to salary or annual allowance, as the case may be, under this Act except to the extent that the salary or annual allowance that would be payable to him under this Act apart from this sub-section exceeds the salary or annual allowance payable to him as a judge of that other court or courts, but his salary and annual allowance under this Act shall not be diminished during his continuance in office under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed sub- clause (4) states that a person who is a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court may be a judge of another court or other courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to be totally inconsistent with the concept which has been argued for by those who urged the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, it is said, is the vice of the present system and what is wanted are judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court who will concern themselves totally and exclusively with <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was urged very strongly as a reason why we should have a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, against arguments which I raised that the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts system ought to be preferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we find in this proposed sub-section a provision that a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court may hold office as a judge of another court or of two or more other courts created by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only judges suitable to be <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges would be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, but if such a judge were in some isolated area, or in the case of some kind of emergency, he might be able to deal with a bankruptcy notice or something like that and thereby save the community money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not intended that regular judges from these other jurisdictions would be judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court but it may be that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court could deal with some of the other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Greenwood  wants to tie the Government to the words ‘totally and exclusively deal with <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court matters’  1  will not press for the inclusion of sub-clause  (4)  of proposed new clause  17C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Greenwood  is now so agreeable to the concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court that he does not want the slightest blemish on the concept, I am pleased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that a sort of dilution of functions which is against the spirit of an exclusive, separate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court could occur in the future no matter what was the intention of the draftsman in framing this sub-section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel strongly that the judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be exclusively judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, with no other functions at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I support the deletion of the words which would confer functions on judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court other than those of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A judge shall, before proceeding to discharge the duties of his office, take, before the Chief Justice or a Justice of the High Court of Australia or a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or of another court created by the Parliament, an oath or affirmation in the following form: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>, do swear thatI will well and truly serve in the office of the (Chief Judge, Senior Judge or Judge, as the case may be) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and that I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand there are 2 significant changes in regard to the oath or affirmation which a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I, , do swear that I will well and truly serve in the office of the (Chief Judge, Senior Judge or Judge, as the case may be) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and that I will do right to ail manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, So help me God.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement is clear enough, lt is relevant to modern times when taking an oath or affirmation for the person to use the words well and truly serve in the office of the Chief Judge, Senior Judge or Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, So help me God’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we put the remainder of the clause that deals with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court I wonder if the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  or the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs would inform me whether the proposed amendments with regard to the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have embraced some of the comments that were made in the Senate Committee’s report with regard to the functions and activities which we would hope would be envisaged in the service that this Court would give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A request may not be made under section  17  of the Marriage Act  1961-1973  for a rehearing of an application that has been dealt with by a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to this and any other Act, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another novel step inconsistent with the practice of courts and, 1 would have thought, inconsistent with the proper functioning of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point is that to create a <span class="highlight">family</span> court which is to have the character of flexibility about it, to give to the judges a competence to deal with matters as they arise and to require that there be regulations is, I think, to limit the judges’ operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can alter the rules so much more speedily and consistently with the type of flexible operation which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court necessarily requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge upon the Attorney-General that to require regulations in this area is to put a proscription upon the operation of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which is inconsistent with all the virtues which are claimed for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest also that if we carry the amendment to be moved much later for the creation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law council, and I am confident that we will, that will be a council which will have judges and a lot of organisations represented on it and it would be inappropriate to consider such important things as changes of regulations that will come up being taken to the judges from that council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause (1), paragraph (a), leave out ‘Superior’, insert ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leave out ‘Superior’, insert ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in such <span class="highlight">family</span> Courts as may be created in the States which the Governor-General by proclamation declares to be <span class="highlight">family</span> courts for the purposes of this Section. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt as to the outcome of this amendment, but I desire to place it before the Senate because it seems to me the only sensible way in which one can really raise the issue of whether there are to be State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The jurisdiction at present is to be in the <span class="highlight">family</span> court of the Commonwealth or in the Supreme Court of a State, and there is no provision under which State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts could even be given jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a necessary further amendment which I will move, if by some chance this amendment were carried, vesting the Supreme Court and the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts with Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision in the Bill or in the contemplated amendments which would enable State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to be created and this is why I propose this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This formal amendment enables the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to deal with interstate enforcement of affiliation orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may say that if we are to have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court ultimately that must be the result, but it seems to me to have a curious ring about it that people may go to one court and be met not with an answer on the merits but simply with the rejoinder that they are in the wrong court and have to go to another court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand why the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  cannot leave the option open so that people who want to utilise the provision of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court can do so and people who want to go to the summary court, the court of petty sessions, may likewise do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is a provision which will enable people in the metropolitan areas to have all the advantages of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, supposing the court develops as is proposed and people in the rural areas will be denied those facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee was quite aware of the fact that particularly in distant parts of some States it will take some time for <span class="highlight">family</span> judges to be involved entirely in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause ( I ) leave out “Superior” and insert “<span class="highlight">Family</span>”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause (2) leave out “Superior” and insert “<span class="highlight">Family</span>”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause (6) leave out “Superior” (wherever occurring) and insert “ <span class="highlight">Family</span> “. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, this deals with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Australian Government shall take steps with a view to the making of agreements with the governments of the Stales providing for the creation of State courts to be known as <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, being agreements under which the Australian Government will provide the necessary funds for the establishment and administration of those courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a State has created a court known as a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the Governor-General may, by Proclamation, declare thai, on and after a date specified in the Proclamation, this section applies to that court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Judges appointed to that court are by reason of training, experience and personality, suitable persons to deal with matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and cannot hold office beyond the age of 65 years; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrangements have been made under which full use will be made by that court of the counselling and welfare facilities that are available to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment inserts the provision forecast in debate today and before, of the opportunity for State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to be created to operate and to have Federal jurisdiction conferred on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Australian Government shall take steps with a view to the making of agreements with the governments of the States providing for the creation of State courts to be known as <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, being agreements under which the Australian Government will provide the necessary funds for the establishment and administration of those courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also suggested that one of the conditions should be that judges who are appointed should by reason of training, experience and personality be suitable persons to deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is something that is already to be laid down in the Bill itself with respect to the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>made of counselling and welfare facilities, so that it is not just the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia; the State courts should have equal access to those facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also put to the Committee that it would involve a constant interest by the State in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area and that this is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must face the fact that social welfare matters will continue to be an extremely important State function and that therefore their interest should be maintained in the State courts which are dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that there are some doubts about the powers of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be agreed that if the States, by creating the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, confer the right to deal with these matters on the State courts, this will remove a great deal of the fear, and I think that it would be preferable to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so that it can be fully understood it is necessary, I believe, to analyse what the Committee has already determined that the law should be, because of votes earlier this afternoon the Committee has established the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme of the Bill, as expressed in some of its provisions, is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will gradually absorb the jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts and of courts of summary jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in the light of that there is the proposal from  Senator Missen  to set up alongside the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- not in lieu of it- a number of State courts with, in effect, concurrent jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the word ‘concurrent’ because nowhere does  Senator Missen  ‘s amendment seek to oust the jurisdiction of the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which this Committee has agreed ought to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet because of constitutional limitations and other limitations which flow from the very provisions of this Bill, the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts must be inferior, they must be second class compared with the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, judges of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts could never be members of the Full Bench of the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, their salaries and allowances would not necessarily be the same as those of judges of the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be part of the arrangments but a moment’s glance at the various differences in the structure of judicial salaries throughout Australia would prove, I suggest to  Senator Durack,  that if State <span class="highlight">family</span> court judges, other than the chief judge and the senior judge, were put on the same basis as Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges it would throw the financial structure as far as salaries were concerned out of kilter in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One just could not do it because one would reach a situation in which a judge of a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court in some cases would be getting more than a Supreme Court judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third illustration that the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts would be second class can be seen in the fact that under  Senator Missen  ‘s proposal there would be 2 concurrent streams of appellate jurisdiction from courts of summary jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fourth point is that judges of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts could not, because of constitutional limitations, exercise the jurisdiction which would be conferred on the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court under proposed sections 17m(1), 17m(2), 17ma and 17n because those proposed sections deal with a jurisdiction which flows from the Marriage Act and that could not, except by the leave of this Parliament, be conferred on State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, I suggest that it is not likely that legal aid would be available in State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, as it is under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 6 <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judgesthat is what we are limited to at the moment; there is no licence for any more by virtue by the vote of the Committee- will try to get this enlightened legislation off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, most States have shown very little interest in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, I would submit that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court needs single direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under  Senator Missen  ‘s proposal State judges would not be answerable to the chief judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, nor would they form part of the directorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court would be a second class court also for the reason that the best judges would not be attracted to State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would naturally seek Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it was purely conceived, but it is being mutilated in the course of its gestation and it will produce not a robust child but a very second rate child, in the shape of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts that will be only a shadow of the national court which the Senate has already agreed should be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, it seems to me that this section departs from the whole notion of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court as that Committee saw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about that passage is simply this: In approaching this whole question of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill the Committee was seeking to bring a new concept into the resolution of matrimonial problems in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to avoid confusion over jurisdictional matters- the sort of practical confusion which would arise, using  Senator Missen  ‘s own example, in entering a building in which the finger post points in one direction to the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and in the other direction to the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is dressed up in the guise of providing a limitation on the age of judges who will deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> court problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 thought that the Committee was unanimous in the view that judges as geriatrics should not deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> law problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing that concerns me particularly about this proposal is that it involves the whole concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, for which people in this community have been waiting anxiously, with a whole hassle of delays and a whole hassle of different situations which would arise from State to State, as my colleague  Senator Everett  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we would have would be a situation in which the money for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court was provided by the national Government, the whole concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court was provided by the national Government- indeed, by the Senateeverything was provided by the national Government except the sop to this motion of cooperative federalism- misguided as it is in this context- that we should say that there should still be State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that unfortunately State parliaments and governments have, as I think  Senator Everett  has said, been rather slow in introducing reforms in this field of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and <span class="highlight">family</span> law administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are 2 examples, of which I know, of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and <span class="highlight">family</span> law administration which are already in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be others but the prime example is the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs will recollect that it was a judge of that court- Judge Burnettwho I think probably persuaded the Committee more than any other witness, of the value and importance of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court exercising jurisdiction under this type of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems clear that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of South Australia is a well conceived, well staffed and well run institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia moves were made many years ago- not to the same extent as in South Australia- to establish a court at magistrates’ level which deals in the metropolitan area of Perth exclusively with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters under a State law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Perth there is specialised jurisdiction and although the courts are not as well staffed and assisted as is proposed in this Bill there have been the rudiments of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that if in the States <span class="highlight">family</span> courts existed as they do in South Australia then we in this Parliament would be investing those courts with jurisdiction under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the proposals would then be contained in this Bill- proposals which are so strongly supported by  Senator Everett  and  Senator Button-  to set up a purely Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I believe that a move has been made to include in this Bill the provision for a purely Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is that there are not existing courts in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the only proper <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court exists in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are trying to achieve is an exercise in co-operation between the Federal Government and the State governments whereby the model of the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court can be adopted- with perhaps some modifications, if necessary- by negotiation and agreement in all the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By such process of negotiation we would achieve an ideal arrangement and, as I have said, if such an arrangement existed at the moment we would not be speaking about setting up a purely federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not had <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts in Australia as yet, apart from those in South Australia and the smaller model in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 8 of the Bill, which we have already supported, states that a person may institute a matrimonial cause under this Bill in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or in the Supreme Court of a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to accept the notion that any appointment can be made to a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the judge may be there until he is in his eighties, lt is all very well to say that we can overcome that matter easily, that all we have to do is amend the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a fundamental objection to the establishment of a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, indeed, of many Federal courts, that the judges have to be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I have been a party, as a member of this Committee, and now in support of  Senator Missen  ‘s amendment, to the idea of establishing these <span class="highlight">family</span> courts primarily at State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support entirely the idea of having a few Federal judges because I believe there ought to be a Federal court of appeal to keep the administration of <span class="highlight">family</span> law throughout the States on the same basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the High Court is suitable in any way to do this and I do not think that these matters should be dealt with by Full Courts comprised only within each State of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges within that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Everett  made an assumption that a proclamation had been made, and upon that assumption there were problems which would exist in having State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts as envisaged co-existing alongside a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that there will not be any State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to what I think is the fundamental problem here, that is, that unless there is a proclamation there will be only a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court I think that what  Senator Durack  has said is probably pertinent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is a fundamental objection to a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court so constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that members of the Committee who have supported the concept of a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court know it is a flaw in the idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not have the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts because I cannot see any proclamation being agreed upon, either because a State government will not accept the terms or because a Commonwealth Government is not interested in creating the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that particular situation we will be left with a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and I suspect that the argument we have passed between ourselves about potentially geriatric judges is the least important of the arguments I have raised against such a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would like to think that if this amendment is not disposed of before the sitting is suspended,  Senator Missen  will give some consideration to amending some of the clauses to endeavour to make the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts a true alternative, by not making it a matter which depends upon proclamation but making it a court to which persons have a right of access alternatively with the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He might endeavour to ensure in that way that a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court can be meaningful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sense that once the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is established the arguments which  Senator Everett  has raised will be persuasive to those who have clients to advise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-AU I say is that there is no provision for the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to be availed of under the provisions of this proposed Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely no provision in this Bill which will enable people to continue to go to the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to utilise the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Attorney-General can obtain an agreement between South Australia and the Commonwealth Government under which South Australia will concede to the Federal AttorneyGeneral a veto power over the judges appointed by South Australia then maybe the Commonwealth Government will get some access under the terms of this amendment, if it is carried, to the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The States have nothing to do with the situation which is established by a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court I suspect that they would want to have the power of appointment even if that power of appointment were in some way to be constrained by a requirement of consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there to be a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case it seems to me there is no place for State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or are there to be State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hold strongly, even though the numbers are against me, to the concept of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This offers some prospect that in some way under a subsequent government the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts might get a leg in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court needs a single direction, a concept of helping out and a developed team work between judges and ancillary staff, including counsellors and welfare officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court itself is to consist of judges appointed in the normal way through the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment would have the effect only of carrying on that unfortunate tradition by having the judicial administration split in this way, so although there is a welcome step towards the <span class="highlight">family</span> court there would be added to it this kind of State court machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is common ground in this debate to the extent that it is generally agreed we ought to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> court which will administer the law in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also common ground that if that <span class="highlight">family</span> court is to succeed it will wind up exercising not only Commonwealth jurisdiction but also some areas of State jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States and the Commonwealth can come together on this concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court I think in the future it will be far easier for the States to ensure that this one <span class="highlight">family</span> court in the States is given all the appropriate jurisdiction, both State and Federal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that the appointees will be exercising jurisdiction in fields which will be the concern of both the State and Commonwealth, so why should not the 2 jurisdictions get together and agree on appointees being people who are appropriate, assuming that they can agree on the common concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness to those supporting this amendment I point out to the Attorney-General that he is in the situation where if a State will not co-operate with him and go along with the idea of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court within these guidelines, he will be free to go ahead and develop his Commonwealth court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of establishing a <span class="highlight">family</span> court-  which is however a matter of essential importance to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not yet approved a vast <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia which will sit as some big brother up against little State courts which will have some lower status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact we would then have a system of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts around Australia which would be State courts and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which we have approved under clause 17 of the Bill would simply be required as an appellate court, as a court perhaps to fill gaps where the States were not able to provide facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Missen  ‘s amendment is accepted we can have within the States the creation of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts which fit the pattern the Committee seems to be agreed is required but which exercise virtually the whole of the jurisdiction within each of the States subject only to the appellate jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court “of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all members of the Committee would agree that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of South Australia is an example of the sort of court that we are anxious to see established around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, in an area where we do want the States ‘ cooperation to get the remaining areas of jurisdiction vested in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the sort of proposal which is put forward by  Senator Missen  deserves support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not compromise the basic concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that clause appeals from the Supreme Court go to the full <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the provisions of sub-clause 3 of my amendment make it clear that references in the various clauses, including clause 7 1, to the Supreme Court of the State are to be taken as references to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently appeals will go from the new State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to the new full <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He put the proposition that there is no provision to allow parties to go to the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to utilise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no legislation creating that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendment 65 is consequential upon the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and merely replaces a reference to the Superior Court with a reference to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Missen  went on to say:  ls not the real problem, which you do not advert to here, (hai under the present Bill you may not be able to prove separation in any real sense, you have a small <span class="highlight">family</span>, in a small house, living obviously, apparently together, and even what has been written into the Bill at the present time which says that you can have separation under the one roof, but you have no real separation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that if this is not so the members of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Committee which is to investigate this matter will be the people who should put up a proposal if it changes thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more, if people read the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill they will not find the grounds within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">FAMILY</span> LAW BILL 1974 [No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is not the only place in which that should be done because the Marriage Act is also a greatly responsible aspect in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill as sound, imaginative legislation which fills a long-felt need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are arguments in favour of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court now envisaged in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be fair to him, what he really said was that in this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill we have some proposals which in one context he described as revolutionary and in another as far reaching, and I agree with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Missen  when he says that the relevant period must be looked at in the light of other proposals made in the Bill- for example, the almost instant availability of counselling facilities and the whole structure of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it could well be that after a 12 months period has elapsed and an application for dissolution is filed, the counselling procedures of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court would ensure that a reconciliation did take place, and if it did take place in some cases that would be all to the good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It permits sufficient time for there to be retained within the marriage contract, within marriage itself and the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, a real measure of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From time to time the wife had taken meals with the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, especially when common acquaintances were present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the sitting of the Senate was suspended I was saying that the definition of what constitutes a separation for the purpose of this one ground which will now apply in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation is a matter of great consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The attitude ofthe Government Party senators is that they must get this Bill through, because it is common talk in the lobbies of this Parliament that there has been a constant wrangle day by day as to whether or not the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is to be the subject for debate in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have on the list at the moment some 40 Bills which have been introduced into the Senate during the past fortnight and which have been held up because of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the volume Toose, Benjafield and Watson on <span class="highlight">family</span> law, which 1 concede was written in 1968, but on my researches the position has not significantly altered in the intervening years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leave out sub-clause (2) and insert the following sub-clause: (2) The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the registration in a State or Territory in a court having jurisdiction under this Act (including the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court) of custody orders made by a court in another State or Territory. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite absurd to use the <span class="highlight">family</span> law in this regard, particularly that aspect of it directed to maintenance of children, to deal with the position of an adult who happens to need maintenance while undergoing education or some kind of training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope that the wise judges who will staff the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and even the young judges who may, if the wishes of some people come true, staff the State courts will not have a bar of this nonsense which allows a person who has been divorced and gone on to marry someone else to turn back to the former partner and seek maintenance from the former partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clause would require the judge to take an oath of allegiance as set out in the Constitution and would also require him to say: ‘I do swear that I will well and truly serve in the office of Chief Judge, Senior Judge or Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and that I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, So help me God.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is right and proper that judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should swear allegiance to a person because that is the form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that most credit for this Bill must go to the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  for his doggedness and his persistence in bringing this Bill forward, for his willingness to accept amendments and suggestions for change, and for his flexibility and his general sincerity in attempting to get a better <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Bill which will have a significant effect upon <span class="highlight">family</span> law in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances, there was no opportunity for persons who were interested in the concept of whether we should have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to give consideration to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I make in conclusion is simply that when the Bill was introduced I said that it was a basis for the constructive development of good <span class="highlight">family</span> law in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Bill there are provisions for an on-going examination by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and also a provision for an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies to study the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a serious matter affecting morale and <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships, and the Committee regards a substantial number of these houses as being of unsatisfactory standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I see him going around the world preaching brotherly love, I wish that he would apply some of that feeling towards the running of Australia in a better sense of the full <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibility of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assistance my Party had in mind was aimed at members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> who care for their elderly relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one honourable senator in this chamber I presented a number of petitions in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill with which we have just dealt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Board has a responsibility to determine what it regards as <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing programs, as prime time viewing programs or a program which features violence, and I believe that someone other than those who provide the programs should determine those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that the Australian people want to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has the power to determine what type of advertising should be allowed, for instance, during children’s viewing time and during <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time and so on, and that they believe there is a responsibility on the Board to determine how much programming should be of Australian origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Henceforth when I get letters of complaint about the time slotting of particular programs on children’s viewing time or in <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time, complaints about excessive advertising on television or the type of advertising on television during children’s viewing hours I will be able to say that because of the Opposition in this Senate the Control Board has no power to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only within the last week attention was drawn to the fact that the oath that was to be taken by judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court was not an oath which affirmed the allegience of the judges to the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are grateful that the Attorney-General after representations saw fit to reinstitute that oath of allegiance as one of the oaths which judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court would take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of an applicant with a large <span class="highlight">family</span> on a low or moderate income where the Director or his delegate is satisfied that it would cause hardship to the applicant if he were required to pay in full the amount of the instalments based on a repayment term of 32 years; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-66-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to assist eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and women and, in one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> situations, their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even when we debated last week the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, it had to be done through the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been debate on estate duty in this Senate and therefore I will not speak at length on the subject other than to say that once again we have the example of a tax which is striking at the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-We have had various Bills such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and the Trade Practices Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to violence in children’s programs, the number of advertisements that are shown in children’s viewing time, what programs should be shown in children’s viewing time, <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time, or adult viewing time and the Board’s powers generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many properties left by a deceased person to his <span class="highlight">family</span> will have to be disposed of to meet all these heavy imposts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The house that was purchased for around $9,000 he now wants to sell to an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> for $ 1 7,000 odd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rent which they paid for over 4 years was to have been taken as the deposit, but in addition to that rent he now wants another $2,000 odd in cash before that Aboriginal working class <span class="highlight">family</span> can obtain possession of that house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>( I ) Subject to sub-section (2) of this section, a district officer who is maintaining the management of the property of any person, having regard to the best interests of that person and of any member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who should be supported by him, may -  with that person’s consent do certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland law in force on 1 November 1974 contained provisions which authorised, firstly, the continued management under the present legislation of property managed without the consent of Aborigines and Islanders under earlier Queensland legislation and, secondly, prevented an Aboriginal or Islander from terminating the management of his property if a magistrate were satisfied that termination of management would be detrimental to the best interests of the Aboriginal or Islander or any member of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen  will recall that he was one of those who, during the proceedings of this sessional period, was anxious to see the Senate spend a fair amount of its time on debating and discussing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Manager of Government Business in the Senate I think I estimated that some 3 weeks of debate in this Senate in this sessional period were taken up discussing and debating the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the House of Representatives chose to deal with matters of the nature of this legislation and not debate, in the sessional period which has concluded on its part, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was a matter for its decision and not a matter for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Government’s requirements, and indeed in accordance with a Senate decision, that there should be discussion and debate of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the development of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning initiatives there has been a reluctance, to date, to include <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning facilities in the Australian Government funded State Health facilities in Western Australia and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-71-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the Administrative Division, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Division, the Commercial Division, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Divisionthis new distorted term that is being used to try to bemuse people into thinking that current legislation is for the promotion of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, whereas of course it is a camouflage for its destructionthe General Division and the Industrial Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 20 deals with matrimonial causes jurisdiction which has been the subject of debate in this chamber in connection with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators of the debate we have already had in this chamber in connection with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill where the view was expressed by many honourable senators that it was desirable that the full power of the Commonwealth in relation to matrimonial causes and marriages should be exercised by the same court and that the full jurisdiction of that court should relate to those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> law area is an excellent example of the failure of Supreme Courts to deal with matters arising from Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will give a similar reference to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Division, which is likewise in a most curious situation, further on in my speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You know why this Bill becomes even more inappropriate at this time when we have passed through this Senate a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which creates a Court and takes a completely different course from what was contemplated in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is in regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area which is one of the divisions of the Court as now proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to set up in the Bill a separate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division which would deal with a certain amount of the matrimonial jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in complete contrast and contradiction to the terms of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which was passed by the Senate and which is yet to be dealt with by the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that if we were to pass this Bill, we would be passing something in complete contradistinction to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not be saying as we did say in regard to that Bill that we did not want a judge who would move from one jurisdiction to another to preside over that court but that we wanted judges who were experienced primarily in the <span class="highlight">family</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand  Senator Missen’s  interest in the <span class="highlight">family</span> court aspect of this problem and I will deal with it before I finish my speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asks why it is being debated now, especially as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which cuts across some of the terms of the Superior Court Bill is being debated at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I constantly urged him not to have the Superior Court Bill debated while the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was still in abeyance, and for much the same reasons as those advanced by  Senator Missen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court which the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs came up with I believed should be decided upon before we proceed with the Superior Court Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am still hopeful that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will be passed but I am by no means certain that it will be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing with the philosophical grounds, suddenly the Opposition has found that it cares about some of the people of Australia- the pensioner patients, the migrant groups, the lower income groups and the <span class="highlight">family</span> groups; the people that this Opposition forgot for 23 years when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made a mistake and now I find that the best way to go back is to go with all my <span class="highlight">family</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the growth of financial institutions catering largely for the middle income earners, there never has been a Government policy directed at the housing needs of that energetic and deserving section of the Australian people- those above the level of direct need, but who yet require a marshalling of the resources of the community if they are to attain the high quality home which should be the heritage of every <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have some idea how to do this, but we also make an appeal to private enterprise to come forward with plans in this field which can be the subject of joint enterprise, where government money is allied with moderate profit-seeking in the provision of high quality <span class="highlight">family</span> homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We already have the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> of banks, of whose work in housing we are justifiably proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, so far as it can within its resources, the Corporation will make housing loans available to families, using the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance provisions in the Australian Consitution, and it will also make loans to those other specific categories of home-seekers for whom the Australian Government has a constitutional responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, if it was a throwaway newspaper, and this is not an opinion I have formed because of this afternoon s episode, I would not buy it, firstly, because it is 40c a copy and until recent times I would not have been able to afford that- I have not got that increase anyway but I hope it will come in due course- and, secondly, even if it were a throwaway newspaper I would not allow my <span class="highlight">family</span> to look at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said that it was governments of Liberal faith in Australia, and specifically in my own State, which gave the great start and impetus to the building society movement in this country and gave to the ordinary working <span class="highlight">family</span> the means of financing a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that under the Homes Savings Grant Act the grant could not be paid to a person who intended to marry because the power of the Commonwealth was limited to the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; so the grant could be made only after the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The monthly desertion rate, which rose to a record 24 000 in the month preceding the offensive, speaks volumes on the state of morale which had been slowly undermined by warweariness, prolonged separation from the <span class="highlight">family</span> and, in particlar, the galloping inflation that heightened the misery of poorly-paid soldiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were to talk of other Senate committee work and have regard to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which was processed through a Senate committee, we would surely expect - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, I refer to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which, although not nearly of the size or complexity of this Bill, was a Bill dealing with very fundamental questions that needed virtually word by word scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the honourable senator would not expect any of the unfortunate members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, who are already busily traversing the length and breadth of this great continent to inquire into the National Compensation Bill, having recently completed their Herculean labours on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, should be required now to set their minds to repeating the exercise at which so many of us laboured for so long and for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subject to a means and needs test the Offices also provide assistance, including assistance in litigation, in matters arising under Federal law, including <span class="highlight">family</span> law, to all persons and under State or Federal law to persons for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibility, such as those in receipt of social services, Aborigines, ex-servicemen, students and newcomers to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Government, as a result of its tariff policy, has introduced income maintenance schemes for workers displaced because of the influx of cheap goods into Australia and has, I believe, made substantial grants of money to some big industries hit by this policy, will he inform the Senate whether small <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses that can show that they have had to close down because of this policy can claim any compensation or financial assistance from the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare system is corrupt we pay child endowment, deserted wives pensions, widow pensions and invalid pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is rather interesting to note that in this regard the HBA is proposing that to get these benefits people who subscribe at present to the HBA continue to pay the present <span class="highlight">family</span> rate of $ 1 .82 a week even after Medibank commences, despite the fact that the Minister for Social Security has said quite clearly that the Government would refuse to register any private health insurance fund which provided this socalled medical gap insurance of more than 1 5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it also a fact that  Mr Lam  ‘s wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> are resident in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had in recent times a long and extensive and detailed debate devoted to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which Bill is on the Senate notice paper and this is an area in which society is reviewing the relationships that exist within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister for the Media seen a report which I understand appeared in the ‘Daily News’ in Perth yesterday, and possibly in other newspapers throughout Australia, regarding advertisements on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning soon to appear on radio and television in Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-These advertisements were developed by my Department for the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association as a result of the Association being funded in this regard by the Australian Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has been in touch with me about the matter and has advised me that advertising copy for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Canberra has been examined by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In every walk of life- be it medicine, science or day-to-day <span class="highlight">family</span> problems- the second opinion is sought and valued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example somebody has a bright idea and says that to cure the problem we need <span class="highlight">family</span> day care, but to see that as the cure is inappropriate to the pre-existing structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be a clear objective that pre-school education should be complementary to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already mentioned <span class="highlight">family</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a low capital investment component, but against this there is a need to have a developed system of supervision, as <span class="highlight">family</span> day care implies, in the decentralisation of care into small units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again we say that whilst we believe that all of these avenues are avenues to be explored and developed there is, in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> day care, a need, in consultation with State governments, with local governments and with any of the groups involved, to ensure that adequate standards are maintained and that there is a sufficient degree of assistance and supervision to those who are providing the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, believing that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is of fundamental importance to our society and that steps should be taken to encourage mothers to be able freely to exercise a choice and to stay home to look after their children, we believe that steps must be taken by this Government to facilitate that choice and that so far as the child care program of the Children’s Commission is concerned adequate emphasis must be given to that aspect which, if one reads the Bill, one gets the feeling is not intended to be part of the function of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to stress the importance of continuing research, as I mentioned earlier, into the best method of providing child care, the expansion of <span class="highlight">family</span> day care programs, subject to suitable supervision and regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy-making and the administration of child care and <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trend should be to integrate and not fragment <span class="highlight">family</span> and child care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> is just like a little company, with the mother as the managing director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption is one of the effects of socialism, and obviously it is the purpose of this Government to disrupt families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government intends to move into the fields of full day care, <span class="highlight">family</span> day care, preschool education, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and any other child care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-schools could also be used as a base from which to operate a <span class="highlight">family</span> day care program which eligible children could attend on a sessional basis and where care givers could come together for discussions, seminars and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Brown, Senator Poyser  and others will agree with me when I say that it makes inroads into one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> life when one has to attend small sub-branch meetings and so on to get the feel of what the membership is thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know the judges have been straining to facilitate divorce and certain groups of judges have been eagerly awaiting judicial appointment to this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill we have provided the same general provision that conversations which take place at conferences in the presence of welfare officers should not be used in subsequent legal proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment is similar to the provisions of clause 1 17 (4) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill that was passed by the Senate and clause 58(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Bill that has been passed by the House of Representatives and will soon be considered by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have argued during the debate on this matter that if there was a desire expressed by the councils of the Aboriginal communities that they should have the right to determine who can enter and who can remain on their reserves in their communities then that they ought to have that right just as every Australian has the right to determine who shall come into his home, who shall come into the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, as we understand it, in the average urban community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That exclusion could be a very severe punishment to the person or the <span class="highlight">family</span> of that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister, having accepted this amendment which leaves a very substantial area of possible discrimination, can convince me that there is some means of appeal against a decision by a council which could exclude or separate a <span class="highlight">family</span> or a group of friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that we ought to let this occasion go by without paying some tribute to a previous member of this Senate on this historical day when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill finally passed through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office already exists in legislation passed by this Senate, namely, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, and I cannot help thinking the objection to the specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office in this Bill, as with the Racial Discrimination Bill which was before us a few days ago, is based on  Senator Greenwood’s  recently aroused antipathy to the Australian Legal Aid Office and is not soundly based in any particular principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I made reference to that aspect as being an essential quality of adjudications when we were dealing last week with the so-called <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, which is to operate in camera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Superannuation Bill surely must have one claim to fame in that a total of 95 amendments are proposed, which almost equals the number of amendments moved to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had it not been for those requirements, some changes would have been made now to the Bill, to take account of the creation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">family</span> law there will be the choice between establishing special procedures, with judges specially selected for their aptitude for and interest in this field of law, or of leaving the administration of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> law to the vagaries of 8 different systems of courts, only some of which have begun to move towards specialised <span class="highlight">family</span> law procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Parliament has already recognised this by agreeing to the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He says that there are to be <span class="highlight">family</span> courts following upon the passing of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought therefore that the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts are not truly to be regarded as part of any Superior Court structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, as I understand it, leaves open the possibility of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts existing alongside or in substitution for a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> court, and that is a matter still to be finally determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had in it a division of the Superior Court, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then this legislature has passed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How it could do so, I do not know, but it has passed it and has created what the Government calls the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The garbage can that is kicked into the Senate has in it the Superior Court which still has as one of its divisions the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the second reason was that there are large areas of Federal jurisdiction that the Government felt had to be handled by federal courts, areas such as bankruptcy, taxation, <span class="highlight">family</span> law, trade practices, industrial property and matters arising out of parliamentary law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The divisions are administrative, bankruptcy and insolvency, commercial, <span class="highlight">family</span>, general and industrial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright and I find ourselves in a happy alliance tonight on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill because here we have a Bill which is admittedly out of date, which tries to create a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division in this Superior Court, well knowing that this Parliament and every member of the chamber on the opposite side has voted for a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which creates a completely separated court, a court in which the whole idea of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division of the Superior Court was anathema because we did not want judges jumping from one jurisdiction to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all agreed that what we needed was a separated court- a <span class="highlight">family</span> court which would deal separately with this- and yet before us on this occasion is a Bill which repeats the nonsense, which in clause 20 once more refers to the Matrimonial Causes Act, shortly to be put to its last resting place, and wants to resurrect it and create a Division in this court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that because the Government wants to have a double dissolution issue- that is all there is in this Bill- it wants to inflict upon this Parliament and upon the people of this country a Bill which none of us wants, which in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> law is not the desire of any members of this Parliament,  Senator Georges  wants to interject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">family</span> law there will be the choice between establishing special procedures, with judges specially selected for their aptitude for and interest in this field of law, or of leaving the administration of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> law to the vagaries of 8 different systems of courts, only some of which have begun to move towards specialised <span class="highlight">family</span> law  prodecures <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There, with the greatest nerve- he has some excellent nerve, I must admit-  Senator James  McClelland tells us how we are going to have these separated courts yet he is asking us at the same time and in this document to vote for a Superior Court Bill which goes in the opposite direction and which would destroy the provisions we made for the <span class="highlight">family</span> court in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 30 June 197S of Bertie Richard Milliner,  Senator for  the State of Queensland, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and her <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recent statement by the AttorneyGeneral concerning the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to his statement that all State governments, apart from Western Australia, have agreed that the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should have full jurisdiction in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the intention of the Government, in establishing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, that the Court will exercise full jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, or initially will the new Court be confined to administering the traditional matrimonial causes areas of that jurisdiction and not be extended to the areas of maintenance and custody which have been exercised traditionally by Courts of Petty Sessions in the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had only recently received a reply from all the State Attorneys-General to whom he had written concerning their intention about whether the States should set up <span class="highlight">family</span> courts or whether that should be left to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was a far better Bill - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We got far more effective legislation because of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims that the new taxation system will benefit the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shifting the taxation burden away from the married couple with young school-age <span class="highlight">family</span> to young single taxpayers and affluent mature taxpayers who are exploiting tax avoidance techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember years ago listening to Dame Enid Lyons- she came from a great Labor <span class="highlight">family</span> as do many honourable senators- when she said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The young fellow suddenly finds himself in control of an organisation which has been built up over a long period of <span class="highlight">family</span> endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can appreciate that it will provide a temporary benefit to a few people, particularly where there is no multiple <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly the Treasurer’s most noteworthy achievement in this Budget is the introduction of a radical new tax system which will give the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man $5 a week extra in his pay packet and will allow him to keep much more ofthe wage increases that he will receive in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country over the years have fought an economy which requires two pay packets in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and because people are willing to go out and work to try to create a financial base for the upbringing of their families the Government is hitting them with a heavy tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like other aristocracies, Australia’s top families and landed gentry are dynastic; some like the Baillieus have their own <span class="highlight">family</span> Coat of Arms, the power and status of these families have been nurtured over generations and reinforced by an intricate web of relationships forged by business links, and marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without going into a mass of details, what the taxation reforms really mean is that for the typical <span class="highlight">family</span>- the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a man with a spouse and 2 dependants- there will be a reduction in tax paid of the order of $8 a week plus, it should be noted, the saving of contributions to medical insurance funds of an additional $3 to $4 a week, these contributions of course having been rendered unnecessary and obsolete by the introduction of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget should be considered in conjunction with Medibank in respect of its impact on the typical <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it provides effective assistance of around $ 10 to $ 1 1 a week for the typical <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget is a wideranging document, and tonight I intend to make just a few general observations and perhaps refer more particularly to the rural and export sector of the economy, for it is in that sector that we find the greatest number of small business operativesthe <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer, the corner storekeeper, the garage proprietor, the electrician and the plumber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever we needed to provide incentive to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, to the individual, to private enterprise, we need to do it now, and this is one simple area in which we could make a start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions, because of the budgetary situation we have been reluctantly forced to cut down on the amount which will be available in the current year for assisted passages, but persons in Asia who wish to be reunited with relatives living in Australia will strike no more impediments than will people from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is another pamphlet entitled ‘A guide to storing food’ and another entitled ‘Don’t poison your <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has said, in effect, that Australians have to get out of their heads the idea that the average person or the average <span class="highlight">family</span> can in future own their own home and they have to get out of their heads this idea that they can live in a home of 1  11/2  squares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I talk of the small producer I talk of the battling farmer with a <span class="highlight">family</span> who has always had it tough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators examine the Henderson report which came into the Senate last week, if they examine who are the people who make up the groups in poverty in Australia, they will find that the aged and the single parent <span class="highlight">family</span>- in other words, people on pensions- are those who make up the largest groups in poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against the background of  Senator Cavanagh  ‘s answer regarding the publication of the names of any organisations or persons who receive money from the Government, I ask: Does this mean that it is Government policy for political purposes to state publicly the names of persons who receive Government social service pensions, widows pensions, <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment payments, repatriation and unemployment payments and means tested student allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not forget the consumer protection legislation, the Trade Practices Act, which the Opposition would abolish, the Racial Discrimination Bill and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, which although not a Labor Government Bill was passed during the term of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What of the fate of those businesses which are run as <span class="highlight">family</span> concerns or partnerships and are not registered as companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a question which I asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General on 26 August concerning the establishment of the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked me a question on 26 August concerning the extent to which the Government intends jurisdiction to be exercised by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act provides for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, State supreme courts and State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to exercise jurisdiction in all matrimonial causes under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is not to be exercised except in accordance with proclamations which may extend that jurisdiction either by area or by class of proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia can be phased in and the jurisdiction of the supreme courts and courts of summary jurisdiction can be phased out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorneys-General of all States except Western Australia have now informed my colleague, the Attorney-General, that their respective governments do not propose to establish State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts pursuant to section 41 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this the AttorneyGeneral hopes that it will be possible for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia to be established in those 5 States by the date the Act comes into operation, which has now been fixed by proclamation under section 2 of the Act as 5 January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which jurisdiction will be given initially to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and taken away from existing courts has not been finally decided because it depends on progress in the build-up of staff, equipment and premises for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since much work has already been done at this stage I can say that it seems probable that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be ready to exercise jurisdiction in all matrimonial causes in the metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Hobart and Launceston at the commencement of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which the courts of summary jurisdiction in these metropolitan areas will exercise jurisdiction in maintenance and custody concurrently with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court also has not yet been finally decided and is still under discussion with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they should be upright enough to indicate the benefits that have flowed out of the public purse into their own <span class="highlight">family</span> pockets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They claim to the public at large that they wish to see a more even society and that they wish to see the poor in the community uplifted but at the same time they see that very great financial benefit is brought to their own <span class="highlight">family</span>’s pockets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I did not know how far back the honourable senator was tracing my <span class="highlight">family</span> tree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time it was very rare to hear of a mother leaving her children to the support of the husband, but today it is becoming common and the father of a young <span class="highlight">family</span> has only 2 alternatives: He can either give up the children and let them go into the custody of the state, or he can give up his employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that inflation has been self-induced by this Government’s almost maniacal encouragement of industrial wage claims and inflation now is such that it is absolutely driving the workman to destruction because of the fire that it is burning through interest payments, rates, income tax, travelling expenses and every item of food, drink and clothing that the workman has to provide for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am able to inform the Senate that after 10, 20 and 25 years of service TAA employees are entitled to 2 free travel tickets for return flights of 800 kilometres, or to the nearest capital city from which they are based, and there are also related <span class="highlight">family</span> concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the effective increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which aid the large <span class="highlight">family</span> are very important, because it has been demonstrated by every inquiry in this country that in this area lies the greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They still will have a considerable advantage over the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> at the same level of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would remind honourable senators on both sides of this House that until 4’/2 years ago I was a bridge carpenter- and proudly one- bringing home a pay packet from which I provided the then accepted every day necessities of life, admittedly with a few luxuries for a <span class="highlight">family</span> that I had to rear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But under a coalition government and the stable economy which it engendered I provided- and, I submit, provided adequately- for my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This economic evil which forces both parents to work to make ends meet is one of the main causes of the breakdown of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as we once knew it and it throws open the doors to those numerous social evils which beset our present day society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where are the increases in child endowment which are long overdue- those benefits which would ensure that the woman who wishes to stay at home and raise her <span class="highlight">family</span> in the age old tradition is not disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose I am a little more conscious of this than most because one member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> was a geologist working on that field but he has been sent to America because the company said to him: ‘We have no use for you here, boy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only two of the Islands are inhabited: Home Island by the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span> and 500 Cocos Malays; and West Island by the Australian Administration employees and their families- about 130 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cocos Islands were settled in 1 827 by the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span>, which imported labour, mainly from North Borneo, to improve the coconut trees already growing there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1857, following a number of representations from the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Islands were formally declared part of the British Dominions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His departure from the Islands scene would remove some of the islanders’ reluctance to accept changes- a reluctance, he said, caused by loyalty to himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s long involvement in Island affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Clunies-Ross  informed the Committee that, as a result of economic and governmental pressures, he had decided to sever the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s connections with the Islands and to negotiate the transfer of his assets to a Cocos Island Community Co-operative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I speak with a bit of knowledge on this subject, being a member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> organisation which for many years has persistently and necessarily ploughed all moneys back into the company for the promotion of that company, the betterment of our whole set-up in the industry in which we are engaged and the betterment of our employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator’s attention is drawn to the press statement made by the Prime Minister on 24 July 1 973, in which he said that the introduction of flexible working hours in the Australian Public Service would have both social and efficiency advantages and was a further step in the formulation of an employment policy which would help people to reconcile domestic and <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities with a career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Office has the statutory responsibility under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act for providing legal aid in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is to achieve a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation borne by individual taxpayers, especially the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who will pay more tax under the new system will, for the most part, be persons without <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities or members of multiincome households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restructuring the scale in this way has also made possible an increase in the value of concessional allowances for dependants thus achieving a highly desirable redistribution of the burden of taxation in favour of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The petitions refer simply to the Bill, and as other honourable senators have said, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was for months the subject of petitions, the majority of them, I imagine, emanating from the Opposition side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That seems a suggestion that private funds from the Saudi royal <span class="highlight">family</span>, which also dominates the Saudi government, might have been involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean particularly that the <span class="highlight">family</span> man would benefit considerably from the tax concessions proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- a monument to the former Attorney-General, now  Mr Justice  Murphy- has completely refurbished the marriage and divorce laws of Australia and done away with the medieval concepts of guilt and fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which also was referred, to a Senate committee and in respect of which the then Attorney-General,  Senator Murphy,  acknowledged the good work done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why, his own uncle was reported in the Brisbane  Sunday Mail  as having said on his birthday a few months ago: ‘We have never had a Labor man in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those who will pay more tax under the new system will, for the most part, be persons without <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities or members of multiincome households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a dependant wife and 2 children is able to earn more than $100 a week free of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The examples relate to a <span class="highlight">family</span> man claiming for a dependent spouse and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one can see that for a <span class="highlight">family</span> man claiming for a dependent spouse and 2 children the benefits flow up to a weekly income of $200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that there would be people in all of those categories who could show justification for the reduction of tax on the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> and the reduction of tax for those with low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that taxable income level is the one in which we would want to see relief in the tax payable because that person on a single income with those <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities is the person who is feeling the real effect of the inflated costs of those essential <span class="highlight">family</span> items that need to be purchased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the tax burdens that have been shifted from the <span class="highlight">family</span> to the single income earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, thirdly, that the emphasis of these proposals and the proposed re-scheduling favours the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I refer briefly to some figures indicating the situation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a dependent wife and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the benefits are there for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a wife and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those benefits are substantial- less substantial, I suppose, if he is a drinking or smoking <span class="highlight">family</span> man, but nonetheless they are there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had a part in encouraging the women of the community to go into the work force so that there are 2 wage earners in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now the Government is proudly saying that when there are 2 income earners in the one <span class="highlight">family</span> they are the ones who must pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of some <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs of the Premier, the papers got mixed up and the announcement was garbled or delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third matter that I thought should have been omitted from  Senator Wright’s  speech was his slighting reference to the <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs of the Premier causing some apparent error. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, pharmaceutical benefits, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts, consumer affairs and legal aid were all affected by the $360m expenditure cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He feels that the pleasure of the nearness of his <span class="highlight">family</span> is not sufficient reason for the burden he and his wife are placing on their two immediate generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of your representations I will arrange for a reexamination of  Mr Alberto’s  case to see if the financial and <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances have changed to such an extent as to permit restoration of special benefit payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A scathing attack was launched on our policy of reducing the Budget deficit, but I submit that no <span class="highlight">family</span> can operate if it draws up a budget, overspends and then just prints the rest of the money it needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they all decided to come back into the work force tomorrow and, by continued effort, were successful in finding jobs, because we cannot use our total work force their efforts would result in the displacement of men who at present are in comfortable positions and are providing for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter I want to mention in relation to the Governor-General’s Speech is the statement made in it concerning the implementation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which I regard as one of the major pieces of legislation of the former Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GovernorGeneral ‘s Speech states that the Government will continue to implement the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the Government was returned to office on December 13, it would give top priority to setting up the <span class="highlight">Family</span>  Court  of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had the opportunity in the last couple of months to observe very closely the development of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court and also the very concerned interest which the new Attorney-General,  Mr Ellicott,  and  Senator Greenwood  before him have taken in the development of this new Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some difficulties at the moment because some cases are dealt with in the various State supreme courts and some are dealt with in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that there will be no legislation such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would be aware that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association in Western Australia has been funded by both State and Federal government grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister advise whether it is the intention of this Government to continue funding the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations in each State and, if so, to what extent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we moved to the Senate gardens to take some cool drinks and general refreshments a measure of the protest and insult had suddenly dissipated, because out there where the drinks were on and the sandwiches were around we found the former Prime Minister, most of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and indeed many of his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These facets relate to the dignity and security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit which is basic to our Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He worries about such things as making sure that his <span class="highlight">family</span> is fed and housed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association which operates in Western Australia and which I mentioned at question time this morning, knows that it has funds until only June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations throughout Australia are doing a tremendous job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People have to rely on the facilities that are available to them through such organisations as <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has also confirmed that the previous Government’s policy of providing 75 per cent of the cost of salaries of agreed staff in pre-schools will continue on the provision- I emphasise this pointthat they integrate their activities to cover other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> need such as occasional and day care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marymead <span class="highlight">family</span> day care scheme, for the Woden Community Association <span class="highlight">family</span> day care scheme and for assistance to the Young Men’s Christian Association ‘children in need’ program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the short time left at my disposal I wish to refer to a couple of social matters, the first being the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a basic unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been my belief that the maintenance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a basic unit of society is essential to our way of life in our Australian democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge, of course, the need for the Government to provide the economic support to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit by way of child endowment, child minding centres and various other aspects of social welfare programs to buttress the economic welfare of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the farmers who had employed labour for many years could no longer do so and were returned to the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the trade union movement- nobody else, but the trade union movement- won the true equal pay case in 1973, a situation developed where, because minimum wages had not been raised to acceptable levels many of those women remained in the workforce simply to maintain <span class="highlight">family</span> economic standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time it is estimated that the extra cost to contributors of these organisations will be small- in the region of 10c to 12c per week <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that became the surname of a whole <span class="highlight">family</span> tree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This became the surname of an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> and the <span class="highlight">family</span> name down through the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to regulations introduced last year permitting the Government to appoint, I think, up to 30 judges to the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: How many judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is the Government intending to appoint in the present financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is provision under the regulations for up to 30 judges to be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure how many <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges have been appointed but in recent times they have been proliferating at a great rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example which comes to mind most is the <span class="highlight">family</span> with asthmatic children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of this legislation may well present a considerable economic strain to such a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a <span class="highlight">family</span> which is on the subsidised health benefit the increase will be very considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost and the inconvenience of gelling patients lo such a clinic create an impossible situation for the parents or the mother of such a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again, in the case of a large <span class="highlight">family</span> or in the case of a low income earner, may be a considerable burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, there will be a minimal increase, estimated to be about 10c or 12c a week, in the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this area there are people who cannot help the position in which they find themselves; there are people who have a child or a <span class="highlight">family</span> of children with chronic complaints; and there are grown-ups who have chronic complaints and who, through no fault of their own, do not have the income to deal with the costs involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time it is estimated that the extra cost to contributors of these organisations will be small- in the region of 10c to 12c per week <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase from $1.50 to $2 for prescription fees will disadvantage the person who is on a low income, the person who has a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, the person who is chronically ill or the person who has chronically ill people in his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them were women who were on their own and who were going to have the responsibility of raising their <span class="highlight">family</span> and some of them were women who knew that, because of the type of man to whom they were married, they would always have to accept part of the responsibility of looking after their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative action a rising from committee reports is hard to identify, except in the case of Bills such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, on which there was considerable debate in the Parliament last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those reports related to death duties, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, a national compensation Bill, television and broadcasting, teacher education, Japan, Indonesia and a whole host of other subject matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened to a lot of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which, as we know, was a matter of substantial report and agreement by a committee of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention has already been made of the reference to the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill when it was introduced into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he will agree that the work carried out by that Committee in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI provided the foundation for the passage of that highly controversial piece of legislation through both Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, I think that  Senator Missen  and  Senator Durack  would agree that the finest hour of Senate committees could be related to the work that was done on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We extend our sincere sympathy to his wife and other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also undeniable that the continuance of a stable society means stable citizens- and stable citizens come from a stable <span class="highlight">family</span> background where the love of a mother for her child is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they choose to stay at home and rear a <span class="highlight">family</span> they can do so without detriment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position at present with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics, since the introduction of Medibank those clinics are able to provide their services free of charge to patients because of the health benefit grants which are made available to the organisations which provide this service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children would receive child endowment of $5.75 a week and yet if, due to divorce, the <span class="highlight">family</span> were divided into 2 groups with each parent looking after 2 children, each group would receive only $1.50 a week- a total of $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been stated is largely accurate, although it should be stated also that if there were a separation of a temporary nature with a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 4 children an amount representing endowment on the children who remained with the parties would be paid to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Attorney-General’s Department legal aid is to be scaled down by $2m and $1.5m is to be taken from the budget of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their theory was to arrange the economy so that it would be just about impossible for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to subsist on one wage and, by doing so, men and women would be discouraged from having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This idea was based, of course, on the fact that if a woman has to take a full time job and has to take the full <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities that she might have if she did not hold a job she would be discouraged from having children because children would be a burden to her and would be a burden to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was, of course, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill providedand we have put into law- that the contribution of the woman in the home ought to be considered a contribution to the <span class="highlight">family</span> economy and ought to be considered as some sort of contribution to the assets of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and, in the case of marital breakdown, a woman should have a claim as of right to have the assets assessed on the basis of the job that she has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government proposed that there should be no duties on the <span class="highlight">family</span> home, up to a certain value, as it passed from spouse to spouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It completely overlooked that basis of claim to property on the grounds of a contribution to the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s economy which we recognised in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make it possible for an individual, man or woman, but specifically in this instance a woman, to get some sort of just economic recognition for his or her contribution to the <span class="highlight">family</span> at the point where a couple recognises that their marriage has broken down and at the point where they have decided not to continue with their marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It obviously costs more for 2 parents of a <span class="highlight">family</span> to go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It costs more because there are certain contributions that the woman is unlikely to be able to continue to make to the <span class="highlight">family</span> economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is giving other forms of economic support to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tremendous risk to the low income <span class="highlight">family</span> in a very high level of child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that position, a woman in the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>, particularly if it is low income related to a general low level of education of both parents, is put severely at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that such a woman is put in a position where quite unbearable pressure can be brought to bear on her to procreate as a means of bringing in <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think governments must find some way of making an equitable recognition of the contribution that women do make to their <span class="highlight">family</span> economy and thereby to the economy of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that at present many Australian women are not truly free to choose; they need to go out to full time employment in order to keep their <span class="highlight">family</span> decently and to educate them to the point which is so necessary in this modern society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that, if the Government truly regarded the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the important unit of society, as everybody keeps on claiming it is, it would do something a little more positive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, the suggestion which appeals to me is the one of income splitting for the purpose of taxation, a recognition that the income earned by one partner in a <span class="highlight">family</span> and his potential for earning income is substantially contributed to by the other partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise this in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious example that comes to mind here is the man trying to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> on his own with the enormous difficulties he meets trying to do that, the enormous limitations which that role places on his earning potential and the consequent difficulties which families in that situation fall into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The supportive role of the second parent- in most cases it is the woman- is important for the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s economy and we ought to recognise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we split <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes ibr the purpose of taxation governments will end up collecting less taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas before the one parent <span class="highlight">family</span> was disadvantaged, now provisions are made which make it easier for such families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time other things are happening in our society which are making it more and more difficult for the 2 parent <span class="highlight">family</span> where one parent is caring for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the attached application for admission to Australia of  Mr Fernando  Savtana Marques, who is sponsored by his <span class="highlight">family</span> in Marrickville, N.S.W., vide Immigration file No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that context that I strongly advocate that a review of this case he made,mindful of the role that the applicant would play in the Australian workforce, quite aside from the current political turbulence, and the fact that the entire <span class="highlight">family</span>, outside the applicant, have permanent residence in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have I been in that position but also another member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> has been unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the 2 instances of unemployment in my <span class="highlight">family</span> with which I have had experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time my <span class="highlight">family</span> suffered because my father had to receive unemployment benefitsbenefits which barely kept us living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my <span class="highlight">family</span>’s welfarefor the welfare of my wife and my young son- it was necessary for me to take the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, because of the expenses I had incurred as a candidate and because I had been off work for a long period before the election I was forced, because of <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, to take unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that this surplus of $5,820 is quite inadequate to meet the normal living expenses of the farm operator, his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> without taking into consideration other factors such as the interest on borrowed money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hardly expect a man with a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> to survive on such an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over some years it had started <span class="highlight">family</span> planning which was having some degree of success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister accept that there are many women who are not receiving supporting mother’s benefit but whose domestic circumstances are such that they also need qualifications to enable them to earn a living that will cover the responsibilities, which they have taken on, of raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been suggested with regard to training programs for supporting mothers or for other women who have <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities is also consistent with our attitude towards the personal development of the individual with the opportunity to take part in the mainstream of activity in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was from many tragic experiences where women involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of <span class="highlight">family</span> and child rearing and child bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the view of those women, women who were intimately involved in what is happening to their sisters in the Third World countries, that if population control is to be successful, it must bc something that the women themselves want and understand and which does not destroy their whole fabric of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government can still take the eggs off the kids in the Central Australian settlements; it can still cut out the breakfast programs in other settlements; and generally, by dismissing people who probably will not receive social security payments, it can take the money away from a man and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People talk a lot about suburban neurosis, about the problems of the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>, about the problems of women from other countries who do not speak English and who are isolated in outlying areas of our major cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, women who because of their domestic difficulties, because of overworkthere will be more of them- have broken down and have found that they cannot stand the pressure of working, keeping a <span class="highlight">family</span> and looking after a house, need some place where they can go after the first violent reaction so that they can find their way back into the community, talk to their fellows or their peers, talk about ways to manage their lives and ways to manage the seemingly endless problems that come up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once upon a time it was the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These days there is not the large <span class="highlight">family</span> unit where there were grandmothers, mothers and aunts to whom a woman could talk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not give a damn what happened to them after that period of producing a <span class="highlight">family</span> had passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When some of them stagger out of bed at 6 o’clock in the morning, get children off to school, do the chores, go to work, come home, look after the <span class="highlight">family</span> and then fall into bed, it is time unions, employers and governments looked at what amounts to not much more than slave labour for a great percentage of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the life of me, I cannot understand why a system should exist where husband and wife are supposedly a team, contribute equally to the wellbeing and finances of home and <span class="highlight">family</span> and life and out of their joint income the husband pays superannuation and then if the husband dies the wife gets only a percentage of the superannuation entitlement for which they have paid for so long, whereas if the wife dies first the husband receives his full superannuation entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least in this area people pay lip service to the fact that a woman who does not go out to work may still contribute much to the <span class="highlight">family</span> home, the <span class="highlight">family</span> property and even the <span class="highlight">family</span> business and are seeing that she is a partner in or a part of that circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decline in the number of births recorded in Australia in each year since 1971 is now generally accepted as the continuation of a long-standing decline in <span class="highlight">family</span> size, not so clearly evident before 1971 because of the intervention of such factors as soaring rates of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this argument overlooks is the long-standing decline in completed <span class="highlight">family</span> size in Australia from an average of over 6 children in the 1 880s to about three in the 1 940s and to below three more recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, and perhaps most remarkably of all,  Mr Fraser  stated that consumers must overcome their unfounded reservations about the future and that when a <span class="highlight">family</span> buys a washing machine or a new car it is providing jobs- a statement which is true in itself, I suppose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is doubling up of housing with sometimes 4 or 5 families occupying a place which has been built for one <span class="highlight">family</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to say that because of my parliamentary and community duties it is necessary for me to employ a housekeeper for the welfare of my son and my <span class="highlight">family</span> but that the Commissioner of Taxation has seen fit not to allow me a $364 deduction in respect of that housekeeper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could find that if the unpaid housekeeper of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is incapacitated for any length of time necessitating the employment of a replacement it may be necessary to employ a person with one or more children who would be solely dependent on the taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a number of occasions it is the female who is going out to support the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the change in life style it will be most interesting to see what the Commissioner of Taxation will determine in regard to the woman who decides to go out to work and become the bread winner, and the male who remains at home and looks after the house and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this day and age, we all know that the existing legislation has a discriminatory effect on widows, owing to most <span class="highlight">family</span> assets being in the husband ‘s name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas a widow usually has to pay death duties on most of the <span class="highlight">family</span> assets, which means that she would have to live at a reduced standard of living once she becomes a widow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, a divorced spouse does not have to pay a divorce tax on the portion of the <span class="highlight">family</span> asset passing to her or him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Can the Minister say whether this proposal might be considered, particularly as it would expand the degree of choice for womenand in some cases for men- as to whether they work in employment outside the <span class="highlight">family</span> and home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the suggestion from  Dr Hughes  was that child endowment for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children should be increased to $30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a report appearing on the front page of today’s Melbourne  Age  alleging that the Federal Government has scrapped plans to finance a centre in Melbourne to give young people contraceptive advice and sex counselling and that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Victoria which was to run the centre has been so informed by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it relate to the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning ‘action centres’ which the previous Government proposed to establish in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> structure has to some extent broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was from many tragic experiences where women involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of <span class="highlight">family</span> and child rearing and child bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole fabric of <span class="highlight">family</span> life in Indonesia is based on the system that perhaps we would do well to look at in part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the answer to the question that I asked some weeks ago relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning centres and specifically those in Western Australia will in actual fact be that they are not to be continued or that they are not to continue receiving funding from the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society in Indonesia is based on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as a whole, which is a slightly different concept from that which we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is rather urgent, not only because the <span class="highlight">family</span> can’t find work in the present situation in Chile but because the son is due to be called into the army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware also that this widow, now living in Adelaide and having no <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia, as she was a citizen of Singapore prior to her marriage to the Australian seaman, has been living on unemployment benefit as her only means of financial support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I believe the centre in Melbourne has been the subject of some comment in particular by the Government of Victoria because of its interest in a centre of this nature and because of its program in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and contraceptive advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an article appearing in the  Australian Financial Review  of 6 April which claims that the Department of Social Security is seeking to remove the maintenance provisions in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that require the court to take into account the entitlement of an applicant to a pension from the Department of Social Security in making maintenance orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is the Department aware of the salient arguments, based on principle and reduction of expense to the Government, which were advanced in favour of this provision by members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and other speakers in debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and which are written into the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inescapable fact is that I am not so much interested in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act as I am in the Social Services Act, for which I am responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the honourable senator will recognise that those 2 maintenance provisions of the Social Services Act are in conflict with section 75 (2) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter which was the substance of the honourable senator’s question with regard to my seeking to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is not a matter on which I shall comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do take the opportunity to point out those 2 provisions of the Social Services Act and to point to the inconsistency that does arise between them and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as having given consideration to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is concerned, I sat in the Senate throughout the debate on that Bill and I am very well aware of the matters that were raised during that debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That particular petition was concerned with a senator from Chile and members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who had been arrested and who had not been brought to trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But priced as they are on the domestic market at this time, it is impossible for a person in receipt of an average weekly wage of, say, $70 with a <span class="highlight">family</span> of perhaps 4 children to be able to afford to provide the children with one egg a day, plus the eggs that are used in cooking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been said at some stage of the debate in one of the chambers that the 1968 benefit which enabled payments to be continued for 12 weeks, for a surviving member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> was in some way an answer to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the already dramatic problems of a person who is genuinely unemployed are now added the psychological and social problems of discrimination from neighbours, <span class="highlight">family</span> and acquaintances, based on the dole-bludger campaign waged so successfully by some elements of the media in conjunction with some members of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rightly or wrongly, I am told that the pill is compulsory for all young girls upon reaching the age of puberty and that there is a system of education- this matter was mentioned by  Senator Jessop  by way of question the other day- which provides education for only 2 children in each <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General: Is it a fact that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court is now the only statutory authority dealing with maintenance proceedings insofar as persons who have been married are concerned and that it is the duty of the officers of the Court to take proceedings for the enforcement of maintenance orders when necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The questions asked by the honourable senator, particularly with regard to the operation of the existing State maintenance Acts in the light of the passage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, concern one of the more intricate, complex and difficult sections of the whole field of matrimonial causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to the other questions raised by the honourable senator as to the effect of the maintenance regulations which have been made recently under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and to which the Attorney-General has recently adverted, I suggest that if precise questions were put on the notice paper that would be the best way of obtaining answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and similar organisations throughout Australia contribute to the welfare and well-being of a great proportion of the Australian people both in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and in an advisory capacity on the prevention and control of social diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that urgent consideration be given to a favourable decision on the continuation of Federal Government finance to enable the activities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and like organisations to proceed unimpaired throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to the Government’s announced intention to make financial assistance available by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances on a scale of generosity not previously seen in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the statements that have been made by the honourable senator are accurate and that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system which has been announced will be a major source of income to families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, the tax indexation which the Government has set about, together with its very enlightened <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, should bring about a situation of resisting the upward spiral of wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The four options available mean that a person will be paying a maximum of $150 in the case of a single person or $300 a year for <span class="highlight">family</span> coverage if he decides to remain in Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person chooses to take out approved private hospital and medical insurance with a private health insurance fund the amount payable, which is yet to be determined by agreement with the private health funds, is expected to be approximately $350 a year for <span class="highlight">family</span> coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is much benefit in that, particularly to the large <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will never cease to be a matter of amazement to me that the Whitlam Government did not take any notice of the Henderson report as it dealt with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why it chose to overlook the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances it never chose to explain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting that it has taken a couple of days for some political commentators to realise one of the most important effects of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be receiving the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for their children free of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous tax deduction system was of no benefit to the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes far better sense to introduce non-taxed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances of a substantial nature, as recommended by Professor Henderson, to make sure that the poor families really do get some benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect which took the political commentators a little while to recognise- it was recognised after a couple of days- is that the Government has given some measure of recognition to the role of the woman in the one-income <span class="highlight">family</span> where there are 2 parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that situation it averages out; the loss of tax deduction is about equal to what is paid in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are paid to the woman, it is income for her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly important in the case of the many families in Australia where young children are being reared and where the wife and mother decides that the best role she can play, in relation to the welfare of her <span class="highlight">family</span>, is to remain at home and not go out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the Government did not just chose to increase the dependant’s allowance but to give some recognition to the meaningful role played by the woman in this situation by introducing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I was proposing to deal with them anyway, ibr  Senator O  ‘Byrne’s benefit I turn to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Government for recognising the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government stands for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances the Government has dealt generously with all people in Australia on low incomes, including Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances his wife- I agree that she is the person to whom it ought to go- will receive in respect of her 4 children $20.50 a week instead of $5.75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the husband is on the breadline which, I suppose, today we would call $100 a week, the rebate is no good to him; so in terms of hard cash that <span class="highlight">family</span> will be $15 a week better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families with 6 children will be $23 a week better off, which means that the <span class="highlight">family</span> with $100 a week coming into the household will have a further $23 or 23 per cent more money coming in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basic medical cover plus intermediate ward care in a public hospital will cost 2.5 per cent of taxable income plus about $2.80 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span>, payable to a private health fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and their effect on underprivileged families, I feel, are one of the most important steps that this Government or any government has taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 800 000 children will benefit by the increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, that means that 200 000 children of migrants will be among them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the significance of that statement is increased unemployment and increased hardship of one kind or another for every <span class="highlight">family</span> and for every resident of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, and I say that genuinely, the higher expenses for every <span class="highlight">family</span> as a result of these measures will undermine to a great extent the benefit of increased endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man, the working man, has found that his wage cannot buy the goods that it used to buy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has this meant to the <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has meant that the more money it has earned the more tax the Government has taken and less money has gone into the <span class="highlight">family</span> pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases it was found that one income in the <span class="highlight">family</span> was insufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the wife went to work and there has been this continuing chasing of sufficient money to keep the <span class="highlight">family</span> going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many thousands of cases this has meant tensions and pressures within the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will it be assessing the changes on <span class="highlight">family</span> income structure following the recent announcement by the Government, and the disabilities suffered by those families whose incomes have been diminished as a result of the Medibank levy and health fund payments, the removal of tax deductions on mortgage loans, probable cost increases arising from the slashing of Government programs and foreshadowed indirect taxation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister please instruct her Department to arrange for an immediate payment of the benefits to allay the sad situation of this <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is the Mialo <span class="highlight">family</span> in receipt of all proper benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the tragic situation of the Mialo <span class="highlight">family</span> as mentioned in one of the Sydney newspapers today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made inquiries about the <span class="highlight">family</span> to determine how we would be able to assist it and found that  Mrs Mialo  was granted an invalid pension from 1 April this year at the rate of $67.90 per fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>May to offer any assistance he could to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that as from 20 May the Mialo <span class="highlight">family</span> will be eligible to receive $182 per fortnight from the Department of Social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not like having to make personal details of any <span class="highlight">family</span> as public as this but I believe that the treatment of the article in the newspaper suggested that benefits were being withheld or not being granted to the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all share the concern of those who printed such a matter because of the difficulties which this <span class="highlight">family</span> is experiencing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assure the senator that my Department is aware of the situation and is giving whatever support it can to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are not taxable nor are they taken into account for the purposes which have been mentioned by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday, in response to questions asked of a Minister in another place about the suggestion by organisations that Medibank could well cost a <span class="highlight">family</span> man another $10 a day and, in addition, that many officers of the health benefit societies would be dismissed, the Minister stated that the position was still obscure and that he could not tell people about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great increase in child endowment but more important than that is the fact that it will be a non-taxable <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It took a Liberal federal government to embark upon significant redistribution of income from the male spouse to the female spouse, that is, redistribution of income to the mother to help her with her responsibilities for supporting the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Labor Party opposed to the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me ask again: Are honourable senators opposite opposed to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have introduced a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that, amongst the great reforms together with tax indexation, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and education growth, was the introduction of an entirely new deal for local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is tax indexation which the Labor Party says it supports and another is <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which the Labor Party also says it supports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in favour of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of doing that, this Government has recognised that there are people who wish to make their own choices, represented in the spending that they undertake, and that through tax indexation and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances personal spending will be considerably enhanced in the next few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with this philosophy, the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will give great assistance to the families in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on giving large non-taxable increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to all families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme will cost $ 1,020m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance of $785m, which is the amount that was represented broadly by the tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations of Professor Henderson have been very significant in the way in which we have developed our system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future they will be treated on the same basis as other children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas at present endowment for a student child is $ 1 .50 a week, in future it will range from $3.50 to $7 a week depending on the position of the child in the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the number of children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows the basic pension, the non-pension income, the taxable income, the non-taxable allowances and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances under the new program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very shortly, charts are to be produced and will be available to everybody so that people can easily see what options are available to them and so that they can pick out which form of cover suits them and their <span class="highlight">family</span> best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, we want to protect and as far as possible to increase the major areas of government activity, including spending on pensions, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, education and defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and similar organisations throughout Australia contribute to the welfare and well being of a great proportion of the Australian people, both in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and in an advisory capacity on the prevention and control of social diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator takes me back into my own <span class="highlight">family</span> history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing my question to the Minister representing the AttorneyGeneral I refer to the growing delays in the hearing of applications under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the removal of some doubts by the High Court and the establishment of the basic validity of the Act, can the Attorney-General give an assurance that there will be additional appointments of judges to the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts at an early date to meet the present critical situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They deal with aspects of the better and fairer system of <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance, and reductions in Government expenditure, that are elements of this package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although, as I shall refer to later, the Government’s new proposals for better and fairer <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances entails the withdrawal of tax rebates for children, this will not exclude them from the basis for calculation of the zone allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  have spoken elsewhere of the Government’s proposals for an improved scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and pointed out the reasons for the consequential removal of the rebates for maintenance of children from the income tax law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of $20.55 a day is some $143 a week and is what the average lawabiding tradesman gets to take home to make the same provision for himself and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Re: Application for admission to Australia for Pietro La Rossa (single) and Salvatore La Rossa and <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am writing in reply to your representations concerning the nominations for the admission to Australia of  Mr and Mrs Salvatore  La Rossa and <span class="highlight">family</span> and  Mr Pietro  La Rossa from West Germany, submitted by  Mr Donato  La Rossa of 5 Rowley Road, Five Dock, and which had not been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should explain that the existing <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policies cover spouses, minor dependant children and aged or dependant parents of persons already living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been associated with the eradication program since the very early 1930s when my own <span class="highlight">family</span> was dairying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My <span class="highlight">family</span> farmed one of the first 3 farms in Tasmania, I believe, to go into voluntary test and slaughter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will do this by substantially increasing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another significant change proposed is that students will be brought into account in the assessment of the total amount of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payable, as if they were children under 16 years of age, and the rate payable for them will be determined according to their position in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$1.50 a week flat, will be increased to a minimum of $3.50 for the eldest or only child in the <span class="highlight">family</span>; if there are two student children in the <span class="highlight">family</span> the rate payable for the second student will be $5.00 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the age limit beyond which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances cease to be payable for students is to be increased from 2 1 to 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new rates of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will apply from 1 5 June and will be available for payment in respect of instalments due on 13 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who are receiving <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances when the new rates come into operation will not need to apply to receive the higher payments, but claims will need to be lodged by those who will become eligible to receive payments under the new eligibility conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For such families they will more than offset any reduction in assistance for children arising from the substitution of increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of tax allowances for children and large increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were recommended by Professor Henderson in the First Main Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will take effect at virtually the same time as the payasyouearn schedules of tax instalments are adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Payment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution will provide exemption for each member of a 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister saw the front page news headlined in the  Sydney Morning Herald  last Friday reporting that 2 persons had been committed to prison by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court operating in secret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would say to the honourable senator that the matter of whether <span class="highlight">family</span> courts could meet in closed session, if one could put it that way, was specifically decided in a recent High Court judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether that decision went only to matters dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings as such and did not necessarily deal with contempt proceedings I could not answer, but I will bring this matter to the notice of the Attorney-General and ask him whether he can put an advising down in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, relates to the AttorneyGeneral’s statement of 20 May indicating that the commencement date for the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies would be deferred until the end of the 1976-77 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall the concern that a number of people within the community expressed that the philosophy behind the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill would strike at the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> being the basic unit of society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall that as a result of that concern the previous Attorney-General inserted into the Bill in July 1974 a provision for an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he also recall that the Institute was established to promote, by encouragement and co-ordination of research and other appropriate means, activities directed towards the protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group in society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he further recall that the introduction of that particular part of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill gave rise to an expectation on the part of those persons concerned in the community that it would take effect immediately the Bill was proclaimed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to the new and increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which, following on the existing system of child endowment, will be paid to the mother of the child or children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for increases in the salaries and allowances of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates of salaries and allowances of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which are at present prescribed in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975, have fallen behind the rates for judges of other Federal courts of comparable status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill occupied so much of the time of both Houses during its passage through Parliament last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates proposed for the Chief Judge and for senior judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are equivalent to the rates for the Chief Judge and the judges respectively of the Australian Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed rate for ordinary judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- at which level the majority of judges are being appointed- is $5,000 less than that for senior judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the proposed increases were to have been made before the commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and appointments to the Court have been offered and accepted on this basis, the Bill now before the Senate provides for the increases to be retrospective to 5 January 1976, the date of commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that one of the most significant provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is the establishment of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is anticipated that the arrangement for people to contribute to the Commission will provide an effective ceiling on levy payments of about $ 1 50 a year for a person without dependants and about $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is estimated that the combined contribution rates for the standard tables will be of the order of$ 175 a year ($3.35 a week) at the single rate and $350 a year ($6.70 a week) at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of this additional cover is estimated at $135 a year (or $2.60 a week) at a <span class="highlight">family</span> rate and would be payable in addition to the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a guide, annual contribution rates to Medibank are expected to be about $150 a year for a person without dependants and about $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he knew that full tax indexation would be introduced in 1976-77; secondly, that there would be major cuts in specific purpose grants, particularly on the capital works side; thirdly, that the Commonwealth would be raising revenue through the Medibank levy from which the States were excluded and, fourthly, that the Commonwealth proposed to abolish rebates for dependent children and to substitute a system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be absolutely fair and objective, I also mention that that quite significant increase in taxation paid will be offset or slightly more than offset by the payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; that is, by the increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which the Government has forecast its intention to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 20 May, I announced the extension of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion provisions to include non-dependent workforce age parents and their dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there are ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> reunion’ considerations present, they are no different from such considerations applying in respect of many other applications and nominations outside the eligible criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does this indicate that <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion was not a major consideration in deciding which Vietnamese refugees were permitted to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government planning to bring to Australia further Vietnamese refugees, for example from Thailand; if so, will special emphasis be given to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The group of 568 Indo-China refugees from Thailand who arrived in Australia included 28 Cambodians and 1 10 Laotians who have close <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships with Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and similar organisations throughout Australia contribute to the welfare and wellbeing of a great proportion of the Australian people both in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and in an advisory capacity on the prevention and control of social diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, give urgent consideration to a favourable decision on the continuation of Federal Government finance to enable the activities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and like organisations to proceed unimpaired throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has wiped out tax savings, which could amount to $10 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a housing loan of approximately $20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The annual contribution rates to Medibank are expected to be about $ 1 50 for a person without dependants and about $300 for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do believe that the objective of the Government is to have a cost of about $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span> and $150 a year for a person without dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been told that the Medibank premium for a <span class="highlight">family</span> will be in the vicinity of $300 a year and for a single person $ 1 50 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate is entitled to an answer as to whether the premiums are going to remain at $ 1 50 a year for a single person and $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span> or whether they are going to to keep pace with the increases in premiums that we know the private funds will impose now that they have a free hand to enter the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making an explanation to the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  in another place on 27 May the Minister for Health said that the premium of approximately $300 that was set for the standard Medibank package, as it is called, will provide a <span class="highlight">family</span> with public ward accommodation in a public hospital and also with benefits covering 85 per cent of the scheduled medical fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 2.5 per cent of a person’s annual income exceeded $300 in a year- this might particularly be the case in a twopaypacket <span class="highlight">family</span>- it would pay him to buy into the Medibank package for $300 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exemption from the levy can be obtained by paying a Medibank premium which the Government thinks- I repeat the word ‘thinks’- will be $300 per annum for a <span class="highlight">family</span> and $150 per annum for a taxpayer without dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third alternative is to pay the levy plus a premium estimated at $135 per <span class="highlight">family</span> to obtain intermediate ward cover as well as Medibank cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this level it defeats the purpose of tax indexation and the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme for the vast majority of wage earners who are on or about the average weekly wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay more than $300 a year to remain in Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will ensure that no Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> will need to pay more than about $300 a year for a total Medibank cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could have been paying contributions for year after year but when one had the misfortune of oneself or a member of one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> becoming very seriously ill with an illness that went on for month after month one received no assistance from the private health insurance funds, despite the amount of money that one had paid in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if one looks at the much maligned pamphlet which was issued yesterday, I think, a single person or a <span class="highlight">family</span> if they wish to stay in Medibank do not have to do anything if their income is below $12,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that people on low incomes- up to $4,300 in the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and up to $2,604 for a single personwill pay no levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume  said also that approximately $300 per annum will be the cost for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to stay in Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This compares very favourably with the expected $350 premium for the private <span class="highlight">family</span> insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The private <span class="highlight">family</span> insurance premium will give private hospital care with the doctor of your choice with 85 per cent cover for the scheduled fee of the doctor in a surgery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have quoted $350 as the premium for private <span class="highlight">family</span> insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives the lie to the distorted and exaggerated claims by some Labor Party members, such as  Mr Farquhar,  the Minister for Health in my State of Tasmania, that Medibank will cost in the vicinity of $1,000 a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third is staying in Medibank, paying the levy and an additional estimated $2.60 a week for private health insurance for hospital cover for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, that will cost roughly $350 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span> cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a one-income <span class="highlight">family</span> the critical point is an income of $8,600 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same applies to a 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments that are being made to the system must be considered in the context of tax indexation, <span class="highlight">family</span> benefits and allowances, and the effect on the <span class="highlight">family</span> taxes both now and in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> premium cover under Medibank is $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the total cost of Medibank cover for a <span class="highlight">family</span> is $300 plus $135 in private health insurance for intermediate cover, making a total of $435. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is to be payable by Australian residents who do not have appropriate medical cover for themselves and their <span class="highlight">family</span> with a registered private insurance fund or through payment of a premium to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) 1976 provides for increased child endowment or <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments to mothers or, in some cases, fathers of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognises it as an advance in the evolution of <span class="highlight">family</span> and income support services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither do we oppose the change in the tax rebate system to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been much publicity to this change in our system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with these measures there needs to be an increase in child care and <span class="highlight">family</span> support services in general as well as an increase in the mother’s and guardian’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like a sense of complacency to arise amongst members of the Government parties or amongst the community about the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> support services now that we have had this change in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many of our large families and single parent families live in areas devoid of <span class="highlight">family</span> support services and the extra money supplied to mothers in this way will not buy the services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does there will be another $250m to be found to pay for this <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that in the investigations of the difficulties between the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and the Social Services Act some way would be found to allow these people to get a decrease in their maintenance payments in line with any increase in endowment the supporting parent may get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson recommended that supportive <span class="highlight">family</span> services of all types should be made available on a local basis to allow more independence and to give an increased range of choices to such families in terms of allocating times between earning and staying at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) deals with the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, the breadwinner of a large <span class="highlight">family</span> tends to earn in general terms the same as the breadwinner of a small <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It merely shows that the resources, the wages, the cash available to large families is inadequate for their needs and that the size of a <span class="highlight">family</span> tends to be the determinant of poverty in that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson and his group pointed out that child endowment or <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are more useful to poor families than to wealthy families; that the allowances are more critical in providing the cash resources available to poor families; and that the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is the appropriate way to increase the cash resources of poor families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that a child allowance or endowment is paid irrespective of the income of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next I look at the paper entitled  Chronic Poverty: City and Country Families  which refers to a guaranteed <span class="highlight">family</span> income as being one means of alleviating the poverty which is recognised in the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through many of these papers the quest for income security and <span class="highlight">family</span> cash support runs as a common thread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we then look at the whole question of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances we find that the Party which I represent and the Coalition Parties in general have a fairly proud record in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill looks at the general and social purposes of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to determine whether they are adequate and what kind of changes are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken the view that child endowment will flow to <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposed action in changing the amount and structure for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is a forward step towards social justice in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time we have denied that <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise has any productive value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would refer  Senator Georges  and other honourable senators to the written works of Patricia Apps in the University of Sydney who has explored this matter in depth and who has shown quite clearly that the preservation of, and caring for, the <span class="highlight">family</span> is productive in economic terms and should be seen as productive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I point out to  Senator Walters,  if she will give me a chance, that the benefit depends entirely on what is determined as a low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the national average of children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> is 2.7 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can never understand how a <span class="highlight">family</span> can have seven-tenths of a child; so I will take the case of a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be interested to know how the Government sees this Bill as a compensation for the new young <span class="highlight">family</span> in the outer suburbia which spring up outside every major capital city in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the scale one sees that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child will receive $3.50 a week and that the amount received by a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children jumps up to $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a women’s centre in Hobart the words ‘A <span class="highlight">Family</span> is Woman’s Bondage’ depict this attitude better than I can describe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General whether it is fact that the Government has decided not to appoint a second <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister received complaints that the present judge has an excessive work load and that because of this <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings in northern Tasmania are being delayed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>health/welfare centres, mental health, rehabilitation, and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was asked to investigate social-medical aspects of poverty including the community services where persons involved in health and social welfare meet to work together, for example, health and welfare centres, mental health, rehabilitation and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services; the relationship between poverty and major illnesses in the community of a socialmedical nature; and any associated matters  relevant to the above and to the general objectives of the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Martin’s  report deals with the more important community services at the health and social welfare interface and covers such major issues as community health services, mental health services, disability and poverty, alcoholism and drug dependence, the health of newborn children and infants, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, and dental health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to judges appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court because they have to be appointed for life under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been one of the problems which, when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was considered by the Senate Committee and by the Senate this was recognised as one of the difficulties and was one of the reasons the provision for State courts was inserted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a mother has a spouse who is a middle income to high income earner that <span class="highlight">family</span> will get no benefit because, once again, they will lose their tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, this increased participation in the work force has been going on ever since the end of the Second World War and is to be explained by a number of complex sociological factors, not the least of which, I suggest, is the consumerism and materialism in Australian society, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s, which were encouraged, aided and abetted by a Liberal business-orientated government which set fairly unrealistic standards of consumerism for the average <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I love my <span class="highlight">family</span>; but the idea that women produce children purely for their own pleasure is a fallacy sponsored by an affluent and short-sighted society intent on genocide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditions of child-care and domestic management formerly passed on within the security of an extended <span class="highlight">family</span> circle are now frequently entirely lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Girls, in particular, on whom the major responsibility for founding a <span class="highlight">family</span> most inescapably rest, often take on the job with an abyss of ignorance which is frightening- and not made less so by the equal ignorance of their partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But even before I had a <span class="highlight">family</span> I was, both on the Social Welfare Committee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and on the ACTU Executive itself, in the forefront of the campaign to have child endowment payments raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He acknowledged that it is a step forward in <span class="highlight">family</span> support that we have been able to give at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understood by everyone that, through the abolition of certain income tax rebates, we have been able to restructure the way in which assistance is now given to families in the form of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The support services of adequate housing, health and so on are important to the way in which a <span class="highlight">family</span> is able to give security to the children who are its responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do want to take up the points that were made by  Senator Harradine  with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the needs of families as distinct from their wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in calling our new assistance ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> allowances’ we are talking about assistance that is able to be given to families with children in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the remarks of  Senator Harradine  that it is important to emphasise the security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the support that can be given to it, but I also want to say that the responsibilities for the security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> do not rest only with government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are responsibilities that should be accepted by the parents of the <span class="highlight">family</span> itself and they are responsibilities in relation to which government is able to give assistance but which can only be shared with parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, you may recall that at question time this morning I raised the subject of the appointment of the second <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that after we passed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill into law the proposal was for the appointment of 2 judges in Tasmania, one to be located in the southern part of Tasmania- in Hobart- and a second to be appointed to serve the area of northern Tasmania and the north-west of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In due course a very eminent man of the law in Tasmania was appointed as the first <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge in the southern part of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the information which was passed to me today, as appearing in the Press, the appointment of the second <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge was imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope that the Government will take a very quick look at this matter because the whole system of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court law, I believe, is slowing down and must continue to do so with the welter of work that the Court has been asked to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of his operations must be increased substantially without achieving the purpose of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, namely, to deal with all those matters that come before the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will impede the excellent function of the Court, which received a very high level of support throughout the Parliament when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was passed into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because he is dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs and the personal affairs of people at the most sacred level of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the present situation- the failure to appoint that second <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge -is a false economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is noi, the purpose of the law and the will ofthe Parliament in establishing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be defeated and the whole system will reach a condition approaching malfunction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we have made the laws, I think that the people are entitled to have access to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly urge the Government to proceed with what was intended at the outset, namely, the appointment of the second <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Devitt  talked about the appointment of a second judge to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court I will be expanding at greater length on this question of the absolutely unsatisfactory condition of the federal judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that 40 per cent to 50 per cent of trade unionists are breadwinners in any <span class="highlight">family</span>, it seems to me that this legislation is in the interests not only of the nation but also of the individual unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary negotiations have already taken place with the University which, since 1972, has had a <span class="highlight">family</span> research unit funded through the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in 1972 the Liberal/Country Party Government commissioned, with the support of the State Ministers responsible for child and social welfare, a <span class="highlight">family</span> research project within the University of New South Wales to undertake a series of studies directed towards understanding and documenting <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption and breakdown and changing <span class="highlight">family</span> patterns in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reference to the former, wide ranging research is being conducted on <span class="highlight">family</span> services in each State and the Territories, to ascertain current and future service needs of families in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These studies are complementary to the work of the Commission’s <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee on which is represented relevant departments at Federal and State levels, and the voluntary welfare sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee will continue in order to complete a major report in this area during 1 976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some officers will be used in activities, such as administering research projects and fellowship awards, servicing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee and undertaking work in the area of social welfare manpower planning, responsibility for which will be absorbed by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has replaced the old divorce, maintenance, custody and property laws contained in the Matrimonial Causes Act and to some extent in State and Territory legislation, and that it came into operation on 5 January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further regrettable consequence of the decision as to the  Emits  of jurisdiction under the Act is that the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, a federal court created by the Act, is limited to the same degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that a person who has taken proceedings under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, only to find that his case is beyond the limits of the jurisdiction under the Act, would have to start again in the appropriate State court under the relevant State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen that the High Court decision has meant that the concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court able to deal with matters relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law cannot be realised under a law of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under present constitutional limitations, this concept can only be realised through a system of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts exercising State and federal jurisdiction covering the whole area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as custody is concerned, the problem of the disputes beyond the reach of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is part of a wider need for uniform State and Territory laws as to custody, including custody and rights of exnuptial children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the High Court decision means that the closing of State courts when exercising federal jurisdiction is a matter for State law, the adoption of the principles of section 97 (1), so far as closing their courts when exercising jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is concerned, is a matter for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the jurisdiction pf the State Supreme Courts over new proceedings under the Act has now been terminated- at the request of the States- State courts of summary jurisdiction are expected to continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court for some time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, section 97 will remain unaltered, so that proceedings before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia will continue to be in closed court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One category comprises amendments included to ensure that State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts established pursuant to section 41 of the Act can operate on the same basis as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the grafting-on of the provisions for State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill during its passage through Parliament, a few oversights and omissions occurred which this Bill seeks to remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Bill provides for transfers of proceedings from a Supreme Court to a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in the same way as the Act now provides for transfers to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An omission in the provisions of the Act governing appeals from State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts is also dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After Western Australia decided to establish its State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, it became apparent that it would be preferable for the Court to have its own counselling staff rather than use that of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, as envisaged by section 4 1 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the request of Western Australia, a provision of the Bill will permit one person to hold simultaneously the offices of Judge of a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By an oversight when the original Bill was being amended during its passage through Parliament, provision was not included to enable appeals to be taken from Territory Supreme Courts to the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which is the court of appeal from State Supreme Courts under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment in the Bill provides for appeals from Territory Supreme Courts to the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To facilitate the determination of questions of law by the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, a provision has been inserted to enable such questions that arise in any proceedings before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to be referred by way of a case stated procedure to the Full Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there is no allowance under the proposal for a son to buy out his father and thus retain the <span class="highlight">family</span> dairy farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision should have been made in the scheme so that sons could take over the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm and retain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I say, firstly, in respect of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill that the Parliamentary Labor Party has considered this matter and decided, insofar as its members are concerned, that there should be a free vote on the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill puts into effect the decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal in respect of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court who at this stage, as I understand it, are being paid at a lower rate than they should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill is a non-Party Bill and members of the Opposition are to be given a free vote on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the High Court held in its decision in that case that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is valid but that there are certain sections of it which are deemed to be invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly oppose the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill which relates to the remunerations and allowances payable to judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present allowance fixed by law when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was passed by the Parliament is, I think, about $7,500 less than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the imbroglio in which this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court was brought into being- almost an abortion- in January - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was overseas when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill passed through this place, I just wish to observe that, vicious though it is I now regard the principle of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill as not in issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we will have to have some little more ex- perience on an extended operation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> aw legislation to see the true extent of the damage that it will do to this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it will be completely subversive to <span class="highlight">family</span> life, as we know it, and within the next quarter of a century will have revolutionised the whole social basis of our civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point to which I wish to refer is one which I tried to put before the Senate when I returned from overseas last year and when we were involved in the Committee stage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my complete dismay 1 found that this Bill had provided for a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court especially set up to exercise jurisdiction in this field under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act- an Act the very name of which offends me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is called the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, just as the communists call guerrilla activity a peace movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an Act for the destruction and denigration of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not provide for the legal protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to sub-section (2) and to the regulations, all proceedings in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, or in another court when exercising jurisdiction under this Act, shall be heard in closed court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have not had an opportunity fully to peruse the judgment, as I read it the question as to the validity of this provision in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, a Federal Court set up by this Parliament, was not in issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts over new proceedings under the Act has now been terminated- at the request of the States- State courts of summary jurisdiction are expected to continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court for some time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In the first place, he refers to the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which relate to social service entitlements and the taking into account of those entitlements in the fixing of maintenance orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has had a long experience with <span class="highlight">family</span> law and its operations over the years would know that where there is all this publicity there is no justice, there is no fairness, there is the scarifying of children and innocent persons because of newspapers and others- I do not need to name them- which over the years made a lot of money out of the embarrassment of people; and that was a very deliberate thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to custody it has long been realised that it would only be with the support of the States that we could get a situation where exnuptial children would be treated in the same way and with the same facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court available to them as are enjoyed by children of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could be children of a wife and not the husband, but have been supported and treated as members of that <span class="highlight">family</span> for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wife may have difficulty and not be able to get an order for custody from the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill means that people will have to go through divorce proceedings and that property proceedings can take place in the <span class="highlight">family</span> court only if they are ancillary to a divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill went through it was one of the measures designed by this Parliament to get away from the necessity to jump from State courts and Federal courts and to avoid the tactics and the costs which are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would prevent, for example, a situation where custody proceedings are undertaken and the <span class="highlight">family</span> court can make no arrangements to give custody to an aunt or a grandparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The last thing I want to say in respect of this Bill which is concerned with the administration of <span class="highlight">family</span> law is to pay a tribute to the AttorneyGeneral,  Mr Ellicott,  because since the beginning of this year I have seen the way in which he has taken an absorbed and constant interest in this very difficult area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attention has been drawn to comments made by  Mr Justice  Demack of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia in  The Courier Mail  of 2 1 May 1 976 concerning the inadequacy of the temporary premises of the Court in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Budget proposal to impose a fee of $60 on the issue of applications for divorce and certain other remedies under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not now canvass the advisability of this impost or the purpose of its application which, I trust, may be for better facilities and services for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether the Government has considered methods of avoiding the setting up of bookkeeping, accountancy and auditing services in the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts required to handle this single impost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fee for the application for divorce is also part of an increase in fees in Federal courts and in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court so the imposition has to be looked at in relation to an increase in fees in other Federal courts as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has brought in a revolutionary scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that was recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into Poverty- the Henderson Committee- which was set up not by the Whitlam Government but by the McMahon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in June, the head of the All Soviet OVIR, Vladimir Obidin, explained that the Soviet competent organs would be thoroughly influenced by the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, in an issue of visas for emigration, but would give out visas only for re-unification with the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is only regarded as husband and wife and their unmarried children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the activities of the Soviet Governments are inconsistent with their own explanation of the question concerning the unification of families, since there are cases of refusal to emigrate to the members of families who are recognised as such by the Soviet code relating to the marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> (see Document No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrary to the rules laid down by the Helsinki Declaration, the instigation for approaches for exile, as before, leads to the changes in the status of applicants, and the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> (dismissal from work, dismissal from institutions, army call up, and so forth). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Cocos Islands were first settled in 1827 by the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span> which imported labour mainly from North Borneo in order to improve the coconut trees which were already growing there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that the Budget makes provision for $750,000 to be spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning but this money is distributed through the Department of Health and not through the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen a report that a group of French people, who apparently are well informed on these matters, have addressed an inquiry to the leader of the French Socialist Party, Monsieur Mitterrand, to the effect that Prince Norodom Sihanouk and members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> have been murdered by the present Cambodian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it the Government’s intention that low income earners who have no dependants and who receive more than $2,605 a year or who are married with a <span class="highlight">family</span> income of over $4,300 a year will have to pay the Medibank levy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last couple of years, most of the attention that has been given to the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law has concentrated on the new divorce, maintenance, custody and matrimonial property legislation contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and on the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts that have been established under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is proper to acknowledge that many of the persons, both inside and outside Parliament, who expressed views both for and against the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation were motivated by a desire to preserve and protect the institution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many supporters of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act saw it as upholding the institution of marriage by reducing the bitterness and humiliation in divorce and other matrimonial proceedings, and by offering greater encouragement to parties to be reconciled or to terminate their relationship amicably through the use of marriage counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, while the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act deals with cures, this Bill deals with prevention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government recognises, and will continue to support, the invaluable counselling work of both the approved counselling organisations and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court counsellors, we feel that pre-marital education programs and courses can, if supported and made more widely available, also play an important part in helping to reduce marital instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marriage counselling organisations that are approved under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are deemed to be approved for the purposes of these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way as under the relevant provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, the amendments provide for approved organisations to furnish annual financial statements and reports on their premarital education activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in recognition of the benefit that counselling might offer to persons contemplating marriage, the Government has decided that where a person under 18 has been refused parental consent to marry and wishes to apply to a magistrate for his consent instead, the person should first have to attend counselling with an approved marriage counselling organisation under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistently with the policy of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act towards the use of counselling, the Bill does not go to the extent of imposing a more general requirement of compulsory attendance at premarital education or counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act prescribing the circumstances in which a marriage is void are to be incorporated in the Marriage Act, where one would expect to find them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a curious coincidence, on the two occasions when this Parliament has approved major reforms of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, the reform of the law of dissolution of marriage has preceded the reform of the law governing the formation of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1959 preceded the Marriage Act of 1961 and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act of last year preceded this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another technical area of the law, namely, the determination of a person’s domicile, the Bill inserts a provision in the Marriage Act corresponding to the domicile provision of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of provisions of the Bill provide for various functions now exercised under the Act by courts and judges or magistrates to be exercised by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts and judges of those courts respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts I refer to both the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments would also enable proclamations to be made having the effect of making these functions exercisable exclusively by <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts and <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A related issue concerns the continued presence of the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of economic and governmental pressures,  Mr Clunies  Ross informed the Committee of his decision to sever the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s connections with the Islands and to negotiate the transfer of his assets to a Cocos Island Community Co-operative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, honourable senators will recollect, threatening gestures were being made for the acquisition of the land of  Mr Clunies  Ross and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Mission found that the isolation of the Cocos Malay community from the outside world and the predominant forces of influence of the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span> had adversely affected the cultural life of Home Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister stated in her second reading speech that the Government had approved som&gt; projects such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee and the various research projects and fellowship and they would be absorbed by the Department after the Act was repealed, but until that hap pened they would continue with the Com mission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am referring to, and perhaps I should make myself a little clearer, is the fact that we hear again and again- this matter has been raised in this chamber- that the eligibility of a single mother for support from the Government for her <span class="highlight">family</span> seems somehow to be connected with her personal and sexual relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much as many of us may regret the passing of the biologically extended <span class="highlight">family</span> with several generations under one roof or close by, I think we must accept that it is a fact of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty has derived the kind of data which makes it quite clear that aged persons do not have the resources to care for themselves in terms of money, they do not have the <span class="highlight">family</span> support and their health is inevitably going downhill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is inescapable now that the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> has gone in Australia; if it has not gone it is rapidly disappearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One important matter is that of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am a married taxpayer who is a member of a single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am, however, bitterly disappointed to find that the revised tax scales for 1975-76 and thereafter still fail to recognize the value of a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary the present tax scales blatantly discriminate against one income <span class="highlight">family</span> units such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> taxable income of $8,000, the married taxpayer who is the head of the household pays $1,320 tax, whereas the husband and wife combination with income evenly divided pays only $800, or $520 less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will rise in the area of the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">family</span> which, as I said earlier, will now receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and will not be taxed out of existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no good people like  Senator Martin  coming here tonight and explaining to us how the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will lift the level of spending in the community when there is not one tittle of evidence to support that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Martin  said, we have assisted through our new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme those 300 000 low income families, with their 800 000 children, who previously just did not have sufficient income to benefit from tax rebates for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under our new scheme, while the breadwinner will lose his small rebate the mother of the <span class="highlight">family</span> will collect the full <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which is equivalent to that rebate and more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, which quite rightly is concerned with development and reform, has seen fit to make the most wide-sweeping changes to <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment that have occurred in the history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That can be seen only as something which will further secure the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in the Australian scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there are 2 wage and salary earners in a <span class="highlight">family</span>- that is, husband and wifeand they choose to take out Medibank at standard rates, will the 2! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He may remember that 2 weeks ago I asked him whether the Government had any information as to the fate or the whereabouts of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, who it has been reported have been murdered by the present Cambodian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, the information was that as far as our Foreign Office knew the reports that Prince Sihanouk and his <span class="highlight">family</span> had been murdered were not true and that as at a certain date, which was stated in my answer, he was still alive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> wage earner is Australia ‘s greatest asset and he should receive encouragement over and above people who receive unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I mention firstly <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which were introduced in the last session of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a move away from the traditional consumer durables, such as the <span class="highlight">family</span> saloon car, to the more unusual type of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I realise that in her <span class="highlight">family</span> the car comes from Germany but I point out that the cars of many of her husband’s colleagues come from Sweden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and the taxation indexation schemes which were introduced before the Budget are the reforms most talked about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We point out, however, that the Government has used the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance changes to excuse cuts in other vital areas such as the supplementary benefits which go to the very poor people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister even had the gall to say that the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme would make up for the reduction in expenditure in Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty is that the benefits which would have flowed from tax indexation and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance changes have been counteracted by the introduction of the Medibank levy- an unnecessarily high Medibank levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a somewhat slighting reference to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance by  Senator Grimes  who has responsibility in this area for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is equivalent to an expenditure of $ 165m annually and it affects particularly adversely the community health program, the school dental program and the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services budget has been reduced in real terms by one-half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The man in the street, whether he is an employee or an employer, has been beset by rapidly increasing living costs, food costs, clothing costs, the cost of a house, the cost of rearing a <span class="highlight">family</span>, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be assumed that a considerable amount of the blame for the collapse of the young married couple and of <span class="highlight">family</span> life is the result of the pressures and strains which are  products of these inflationary years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that for the first time in a very long period the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> has been ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I certainly have no quarrel with our immigration program I believe that in these days when we are nearing zero growth and when our population is nothing more than static, the natural Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> must be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should not the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> be assisted in providing our future citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let us look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which were presented to the community in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is costly to the taxpayer, destroys confidence and involves heavier costs in the long term, lt has been demonstrated elsewhere that once the ‘take-off’ point has been reached in a new centre the cost per head of housing an Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> is considerably less than is the case in housing that <span class="highlight">family</span> in a capital city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expresses to the people of China profound regret and tenders its deep sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I should like to join with all honourable senators and world leaders in paying tribute to  Chairman  Mao Tsetung, in expressing the condolences of the whole Senate to the Chinese people and to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and in putting on record our appreciation of his contribution to mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of all Government senators, I extend our sympathies to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said last night and repeated on a radio program- I hope  Senator Wriedt  will understand it and I commend to him a second listening to that programwas that when tax indexation and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme were set off against the change in the tax rebate system, something like $ 1 , 000m increased purchasing power was in the hands of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will pay actual fare costs based on economy class travel associated with a person and his <span class="highlight">family</span> exploring a prospective job in the new location and subsequently moving to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also applies to the applicant and /or <span class="highlight">family</span> moving to the new location to take up residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides- I think this would be of great importance to people in the outback- if the applicant moves to his new place of employment ahead of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, for 2 return visits to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister for Social Security to a report in the  Australian Financial Review  today relating to negotiations with the banks to credit <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to accounts monthly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the position of a <span class="highlight">family</span> which wants to receive <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments more frequently than on a quarterly basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is not correct in all its detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement that the Government may pull out of negotiations with the banks to credit the monthly <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments unless the dispute over fees is resolved fairly soon is not accurate because the Government is negotiating with the banks with regard to crediting to accounts, on a monthly basis instead of on a 3-monthly basis, the increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Maunsell  will agree with me that in some locations, such as in some of the provincial cities where young people are locked into an area because of the need to keep the <span class="highlight">family</span> together, it is as high as 600 to 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking from my experience with my own <span class="highlight">family</span>, my son who has completed a university course and has 2 degrees with honours in zoology is still unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that when the results of tax indexation and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which amount to about $ 1,000m, begin to show in the community we will see a rise in consumer spending which is necessary to gear up the productivity of the nation and to gear up the industries so that they can employ more people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the only Housing Commission allocation ever made to the area of Cooktown, which has about 1000 people a large number of whom are fairly elderly, has been for one home and that was for an ordinary working <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we could not obtain a public bed for him at that time, that little <span class="highlight">family</span> group of father and daughter was in the situation where she had to use all her wages, plus the <span class="highlight">family</span> savings, in order to keep her father in a private ward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the student is faced with the problems of adjusting to living in a larger town and attending a large school without the benefit of <span class="highlight">family</span> kin support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, however, the young student, a long way from home and without <span class="highlight">family</span> support, has a very difficult road to success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of this sort of suitable accommodation at an affordable cost often deters Aboriginal people from seeking medical attention which they or their <span class="highlight">family</span> require, and if they do receive such medical assistance it does happen that these patients are kept in hospital for longer than is necessary purely because of the lack of suitable accommodation in which aftercare medical treatment and full recovery can be effected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without temporary accommodation the mother and her children are sometimes unable to avoid these difficult circumstances, the continuity and security so essential for any <span class="highlight">family</span> is often disrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal people, as do many others for a variety of reasons, often choose to seek employment opportunities away from their original area, or <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of such people are forced to sleep in unsanitary and hazardous conditions in parks, railway stations, culverts and abandoned cars at some personal and health risk or are forced to overcrowd <span class="highlight">family</span> or kin resident households possibly causing anxiety, financial difficulties, and stress for all concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> tariff associated with an income earner is 50 per cent of the normal gross earnings up to a maximum of $56 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dependents of Hostel Managers/House Parents are required to pay the equivalent of tariff charges for migrant hostel accommodation for <span class="highlight">family</span> dependents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following this Government’s establishment of increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, particularly to assist the low <span class="highlight">family</span> income earner, the Company is in the process of revising its tariffs to take account of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances within total income assessed for tariff purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to introduce a new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances paid to wives will provide a substantial increase in income for many Aboriginal families and reduce the demands on some programs that were necessary for Aborigines in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This still results in a net cost to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of about $3,800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">family</span> cannot afford the cost of converting from manual to automatic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> to which I referred,  Mr and Mrs Green  of Lock, is in a fairly awkward position because  Mr Green  does not enjoy good health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Green <span class="highlight">family</span> were able to do some of the work- I have already said that due to sickness this is not possible- their commitment could have been reduced to about $1,000 over 3 years, which is an expenditure of approximately $300 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We only have to look at Carrington ‘s private shipyard at Newcastle, owned by the Lavarack <span class="highlight">family</span>, which builds small ships, does not attract the bounty and does not even have on-shore engineering works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Cairns, the North Queensland Engineering and Agency Co., another private show, run by the Fry <span class="highlight">family</span>, has a shipyard about half a kilometre from a Chinese,  Mr Hing  who builds one ship a year about 100 feet long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister for Social Security advise the Senate whether <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are in some cases payable to Australian citizens who, together with their families, are temporarily overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are payable, what are the circumstances in which persons remain eligible to receive a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question refers to the fact that a single parent will be made to pay the Medibank levy at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is acknowledged that the single parent <span class="highlight">family</span> faces greater financial difficulties already, will the Minister investigate this matter further to see whether a more equitable rate can be struck for the single parent in line with statements by the Minister for Social Security that special groups will be catered for under new Government legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When introducing the National Health Amendment Bill 1976, 1 indicated to honourable senators that the cost of this hospital-only insurance for a person remaining in Medibank standard was estimated at $ 1 35 a year or $2.60 a week- at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate- and would be payable in addition to the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the contribution rates for Medibank private health insurance were being determined it became apparent that the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables would exceed $2.60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its concern to keep the cost of this type of insurance within the reach of those with low to medium incomes, the Government decided to give a subsidy to hold the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rate to $2.60 a week and the single contribution rate to $1.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum rates of Commonwealth subsidy are based on the difference between the contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables for privately insured persons in Medibank private and $1.30 a week for single rate contributors and $2.60 a week for <span class="highlight">family</span> rate contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides for the rates of $1.30 a week for single contributors and $2.60 a week for <span class="highlight">family</span> contributors, and for the rates of Commonwealth subsidies, to be varied by regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions have become redundant as a result of the proposal to introduce individual and <span class="highlight">family</span> levy ceilings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and similar organisations throughout Australia contribute to the welfare and well-being of a great proportion of the Australian people both in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and in an advisory capacity on the prevention and control of social diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that urgent consideration be given to a favourable decision on the continuation of Federal Government finance to enable the activities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and like organisations to proceed unimpaired throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also confirm that a working wife whose husband is paying the levy at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate will not have the levy deducted from her salary and be forced to make a similar loan to the Taxation Office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that a number of amendments were made to the Act by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 80 per cent of Commonwealth funds appropriated for legal aid matters referred to private practitioners is in respect of matters arising under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 80 per cent of this figure therefore will represent payments for <span class="highlight">family</span> law legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having in mind the facilities provided by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, a fee of $60 is not regarded as excessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of applications filed in a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court -at the moment only the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia- the Bill provides that the fees are to be paid to the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the request of Western Australia, the Bill will enable the Commonwealth Attorney-General to delegate his power of intervention in proceedings to the AttorneyGeneral of a State having a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a husband and wife are both taxpayers, it is proposed that their individual levy liabilities are not, in total, to exceed the <span class="highlight">family</span> ceiling of $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, to conclude my introductory references to the ceiling arrangements, a serviceman with a <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay no more levy than $ 1 50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we often lose sight of the fact that the health scheme is part of a three-fold economic package including the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these latter measures will in the long term greatly assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its concern to keep the cost of this type of insurance within the reach of those with low to medium incomes, the Government decided to give a subsidy to hold the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rate to $2.60 a week and the single contribution rate to $1.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Quality Health Care for You and Your <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution for this accommodation is $2.60 a week and the single rate is $ 1 .30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party decided that both husband and wife who work hard and save their money for their <span class="highlight">family</span> and their home should both pay the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there should be a combined income and that the combined income should have a ceiling of $300 for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I want my private doctor, my <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor who has taken care of me, my wife and my children, my doctor who I am confident will be able to look after me when I am in hospital, I have that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that I will not be imposing on your leniency,  Mr President,  by saying that since the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances I have had the opportunity of seeing the difference this has meant to many families throughout my State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact I have seen the effects of it even on my own quite large <span class="highlight">family</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does appear that if a man chooses to pay the Medibank levy, the $300 <span class="highlight">family</span> cover, his wife if working will have the $150 levy for a single person deducted from her - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of income at which the single parent- usually a single mother- will have to pay the levy is lower than the level of income at which a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a dependent spouse will have to pay the levy, even though the single parent is likely to have a lower overall income and has a <span class="highlight">family</span> to support, just as has the 2-parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example of this is the operation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Labor system, because everybody was covered by Medibank, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services were able to be offered free, that is, without direct charge to the person seeking those services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was an extremely useful technique because a lot of people, particularly women, seeking <span class="highlight">family</span> planning advice are without an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of them are young girls who are seeking <span class="highlight">family</span> planning advice without the knowledge of their parents and the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning service was able to offer proper services without demanding fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation now for <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services is that either they will have to require a cash payment, which many of the patients will not be able to provide, or they will need to know what sort of health insurance scheme the patient is insured with which will be a breach of confidentiality as far as some wives and daughters are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested that the introduction of tax indexation and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would improve the living standards of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should restate that the maximum contribution to Medibank Public is $300 a year for <span class="highlight">family</span> cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those with taxable incomes below that amount will pay less than $300 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> in each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though they need to pay more for private insurance, people are prepared to take that cover as an alternative to the Medibank cover which would cost the <span class="highlight">family</span> less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer stated that the schedules of the pay as you earn deductions released to the Press and published on 1 September last referred to this situation and stated that a husband whose pay is significantly more than $1 15 a week, the point at which the single rate of ceiling starts to apply, has an option to have the levy deducted at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a working wife satisfies the Taxation Office that her husband has exercised the option and that his income is such that he will be liable to pay the full <span class="highlight">family</span> levy at the end of the year, the Taxation Office will, on her application, authorise the wife ‘s employer not to make any deductions on account of a levy from her pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one member of the couple takes out <span class="highlight">family</span> private insurance, both of course are entitled to lodge an exemption claim with their respective employers and to have the levy component excluded from their pay as you earn deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be eligible for the sole parent rebate of $350 the single parent must have the sole care of a dependent child or children, that is, there must be at least 2 people in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows for levy purposes that, just as the <span class="highlight">family</span> ceiling rate of levy applies to a married person because there are two or more people in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, so the ceiling levy for a sole parent is at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we understand it, this is consistent with private insurance practice and a sole parent, like a married person, for full cover with a registered private fund would have to take out insurance at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter raised relates to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to assure the Senate that there will be no breach of confidentiality in respect of wives and daughters who seek <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning organisations will bulk bill the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Levy payers and those eligible for Medibank benefits will not be charged and the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning organisations will receive health program grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the dependants of the <span class="highlight">family</span> contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these non-billable cases, the Government will pay health program grants to cover the costs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guidelines for these services are at present being established and I believe that the confidentiality of the service that is given to persons within a <span class="highlight">family</span> is protected by the arrangements that I am announcing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But probably the worst result of all flowing from the Government’s action- and I base my claim on the Government’s figures produced after 20 May and the figures produced as a result of combining the effects of this action on tax indexation, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme and adding the Medibank levy- will be that the vast majority of wage earners who earn from $110 a week to $ 1 90 a week in this country will be out of pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has misled because it has told them with one voice that they will gain by tax indexation but with another voice it has said that they will gain from the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government is not telling them and did not tell them that the combined effect of the loss of the children ‘s rebate, which we accept along with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme, plus the Medibank levy in fact will put them out of pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Herald’s  point is that if a man does not pay the health insurance levy his wife is denied her right to free Medibank insurance, because, as  Mr Lynch  admits, the rule is that, for exemption from levy to be available to anyone with a <span class="highlight">family</span>, the <span class="highlight">family</span> must be covered by private insurance.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that health costs are considerable and that each Australian will see his or her <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor on an average of about 40 times between birth and adulthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this would have been that every 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia would have paid the full levy no matter what total effect that had on the <span class="highlight">family</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hawke  would have had them paying to the sky with no remittance for a <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia should ponder the fact that had  Mr Hawke  had his way their levy would have been higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ceiling will help those Australians who have more than one income in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walters  interjected and said that there was no provision in the Labor Party’s legislation at that time for a ceiling such as we have now of $150 for a single person and $300 for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The memorandum does state that a lone parent will pay the common levy of 2.5 per cent up to a maximum of $300, which is the same is a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit will pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lone parent is exempted from the Medibank levy if his or her taxable income is less than $3,790 a year; but the exemption from the levy for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is a taxable income of under $4,299 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cheapest health care available today is the standard Medibank care which can be obtained for a maximum, I think, of $2.90 for a single taxpayer and $5.80 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have proved that with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and other social welfare legislation which we have introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> under the Hawke scheme would have paid more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">family</span> in which the husband and wife both work would have been worse off than under our scheme which, of course, has a ceiling of $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A husband and wife who each have a taxable income are to be separately assessed for levy on their own taxable income but are to be entitled to share in the one <span class="highlight">family</span> ceiling of $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken very much the same action with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the Budget Papers in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances it is clear that about $700m extra will be spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances this year but, on the other hand, about $700m will be saved because dependent children will no longer be allowable as a tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point was tax indexation, the second was the improvements in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, and the third was the introduction of a Medibank levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine  was concerned as to why the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowanceindexationlevy package was not introduced on the one day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The improved system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance started from 1 July to benefit people with families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We felt that it was the consensus amount the majority of the members of the Senate when the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation was passed that fees should not be imposed; that the whole question of costs should be put on the basis that each party should bear his or her own costs; and that it was desirable to remove as much as possible from the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation any friction which might arise at the time of the dissolution of a marriage from the imposition of fees or the payment of costs or arguments about those matters between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not find that, in the context of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation, a very persuasive reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been a very real problem in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction in a number of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also a provision giving the Commonwealth power to delegate the right of intervention of the Attorney-General to the Attorney-General of a particular State where there is a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have always taken the view that the least messy way to handle <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation is for the Commonwealth to ask the States to refer powers in matters associated with divorce such as the custody, maintenance and ancillary matters of those kinds to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would not be problems that conceivably could arise by the creation of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, different decisions about the meaning of the Act and even the principles of the Act given in various State courts and consequent confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is the second Bill this year which seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions have been made to the AttorneyGeneral that this fee should be imposed in some way by stamp and that it should not be something requiring the setting up of some financial organisation in the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts at considerable expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having in mind the facilities provided by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, a fee of $60 is not regarded as excessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general it is necessary to have the <span class="highlight">family</span> court operating in the best possible way, as I think this Bill provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the problem that one can no longer say that custody can entirely be dealt with in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a split between the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the facilities which are being provided by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court I believe that there is a need for more courts and for more judges to go out into the country and provide services closer to home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to say that this is an attempt to offset the high costs that are borne by the community in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reading speech states that in this year’s Budget a total of $9.5m has been provided for payment  to  private professions for legal aid and the approximately 80 per cent of this figure will represent payments for <span class="highlight">family</span> law legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either the community pays through taxation on the basis of capacity to pay or the people who utilise the <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings for divorce have to pay on the basis of their capacity to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government ought to have a good look at the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to see how much of the tab the taxpayers of this country are picking up for those who wish to indulge themselves in respect of this  matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- I am pleased that the Senate is supporting all the provisions of this Bill except for the one which enables fees to be levied by regulation in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts this year will cost $1 lm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite proper that the increased cost of legal aid- particularly the increased amount in this year’s Budget for legal aid- should be taken into account when dealing with this question of the imposition of a fee for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other matter to which I think I should refer is the suggestion as to how the Government should cope with some of the problems which have been presented by the recent decision of the High Court which has reduced the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in certain significant matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s hope that the States which, unlike Western Australia, have not set up their own State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts will be prepared to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are impressed with the way in which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia is operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a court that was in contemplation by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which made recommendations on <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to this Senate which ultimately were incorporated in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, we believe as a government that it would be far better and far more consistent- with our notions of federalism- if the States were to set up their own <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts on the overall terms laid down in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition rejects the tying of the fee concept in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to the financing of legal aid for the reasons given by the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Durack)  in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, 80 per cent of the provision for legal aid is being spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply another reason advanced for the need to receive some contribution from those people who are litigating in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and similar organisations throughout Australia contribute to the welfare and well-being of a great proportion of the Australian people both in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and in an advisory capacity on the prevention and control of social diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that urgent consideration be given to a favourable decision on the continuation of Federal Government finance to enable the activities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and like organisations to proceed unimpaired throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also little chance for the foundation of <span class="highlight">family</span> stability and the growth of self-respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In working out the contents of community profiles, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances received by a community will be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention here that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, which is estimated to provide $16m directly to Aboriginal families, is not regarded as a substitute for special Aboriginal programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister pointed out to the House on 25 August the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal families and gives them an independence and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those initiatives were in line with the Government’s continuing concern to effect the reunion of close <span class="highlight">family</span> relatives overseas with Lebanese residents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it morally right that my <span class="highlight">family</span> should be so harrassed and tormented for the political views held by my son George Fernandes’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever I have stated here is on the basis of what the <span class="highlight">family</span> could gather from Lawrence during the visits to him in the cell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also urge that he should be transferred to a good hospital and specialist medical and psychatric treatment be given to him and daily visits to him by the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowed so that he may regain his mental and physical health and become a human being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and similar organisations throughout Australia contribute to the welfare and well-being of a great proportion of the Australian people both in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and in an advisory capacity on the prevention and control of social diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that urgent consideration be given to a favourable decision on the continuation of Federal Government finance to enable the activities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and like organisations to proceed unimpaired throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recent remarks of the South Australian Attorney-General,  Mr Duncan,  to the effect that the delay in hearing maintenance applications in South Australian courts is the fault of the Federal Government because it has not allowed these applications to be heard in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has  Mr Duncan  raised this matter with the Minister and/or officers of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would not the provision of the facility of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court for these hearings increase the backlog of other divorce matters before that Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has apparently alleged that the Federal Attorney-General has refused to agree to these applications being heard by the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia continually hears applications for maintenance in South Australia, as it does in all States in which it operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not do so, of course, in Western Australia because that State has its own State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is hearing many applications in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that there is concurrent jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and the ordinary State magistrates’ courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the delay in the hearing of applications in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in South Australia- that is, the Federal Court- is 6 weeks, but, of course, urgent cases would be heard much sooner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another search for cents, the maximum adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income which attracts the full allowance will be increased by only $600 to $8,200 a year, again despite high inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the secondary allowance scheme to assist families to keep children at high school the maximum allowance has been increased by only $100 whilst the maximum <span class="highlight">family</span> income to attract the full allowance has been increased from $4,300 to only $5, 1 50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two per cent of all <span class="highlight">family</span> heads in Australia are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 2 families in every 100 the state of affairs is disastrous because the breadwinner is not able to earn the weekly income needed to sustain the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other important new initiative by the Government in this area is the increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a practice would reinforce employer attempts to make the dual income the norm and would make it much harder for the <span class="highlight">family</span> wage earner to make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not say to the Dunlop workers or to the workers in the rubber industry in New South Wales: ‘You must uproot your <span class="highlight">family</span> and move to Victoria’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not always possible in the crossfire to get a point across but I say sincerely that quite a lot of husbands and wives, probably with <span class="highlight">family</span> co-operation, decide that both of them will work so that by the age of forty they will have paid off a home, unlike the parents of a lot of us who had not paid off their homes before they were in their late fifties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have introduced the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme this year- a significant and important reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was of some interest to me that at the recent census the question had been raised as to whether there was an intrusion on the privacy of an individual in being asked whether he or a member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> suffered any handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Restoration of the income tax rebates to divorced men who are paying maintenance for their children would result in the Government paying double assistance in respect of the children, as the mothers would also be in receipt of enhanced <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is, of course, a fundamental difference, and that is that it is recognised in the first place that some dependence is accepted by the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It substantially upgraded the rate so that the student, in his or her position in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, now attracts a substantially greater student allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, this day, of  Senator the  Honourable Ivor John Greenwood, Q.C,  Senator for  the State of Victoria from 1 968, a Minister of the Crown from 1971 to 1972 and from 1975 to 1976,  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1972 to 1975, and  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1975 to 1976, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy for all of us but particularly for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The notable thing is that as I have been moving around Australia during the past months I have been asked about him by people at meetings I have attended-people who might not have known him personally but people who said that their prayers were with him and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His personal life was based, I think, fundamentally on the fact that he came from a very fine <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They and other members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> helped to make him the man he was in the community and the man he was in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like the Senate and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to know that in the last three or four months, when going around my State, many people asked about  Senator Greenwood’s  health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that delays in the hearings of applications by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts are increasing and that the number of unheard applications is increasing in Melbourne at the rate of approximately 60 a month? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the same situation developing in other <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Government proposing to do by way of further appointments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia to alleviate this situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate would know, the Attorney-General is negotiating with the State governments which have not established their own State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, as has the State of Western Australia, to ascertain whether they would at this stage be prepared to establish such courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that while those negotiations are going on there may be some question about the desirability of appointing additional judges to the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those cases where that situation occurs with a student 16 years of age or older, will that student’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance continue to be paid until the school leaver becomes eligible for the unemployment benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance continues for the children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> while those children are dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary for them to be attending school, because the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance continues to be paid for student children until they are 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would continue to be paid in the case of a 16-year old dependent child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Can he say why it is that in the case of divorced parents, where the father is paying maintenance to his exwife and contributing towards the upkeep of the children of the marriage who are in the mother’s custody, the father is obliged under the law to pay the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate Medibank levy whilst the exwife, if she is in receipt of an income above a certain level, has also to pay the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate levy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in effect, is forcing people in the circumstances I have stated to pay double the amount of levy they would otherwise be expected to pay if they were not divorced and were still living together as a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those counted as ‘dependent children’ comprised all <span class="highlight">family</span> members under 1 5 years of age and all <span class="highlight">family</span> members aged 15-20 who were fulltime students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Attorney-General aware of an increasing backlog of cases before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Tasmania and that cases now being registered at the Court cannot be listed for hearing before January or February next year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that there is only one <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge in Tasmania and no doubt that would cause some special problems in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the desirability of preserving and fostering contacts between families overseas and their relatives here, some of whom they have never seen, such as young people born in this country, could there not be a relaxation of this requirement, which adds considerably to the costs of these presents and is damaging to the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> contacts which are so important to these people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The handicapped child’s allowance is particularly designed  to help the parents  or guardians of severely handicapped children under the age of 16 years who need constant care and attention and who provide this care in the <span class="highlight">family</span> home rather than place the child in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week  Senator Wriedt  and  Senator Missen  asked me questions concerning delays in the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular,  Senator Wriedt  asked me a question concerning a problem in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have done so and he has authorised me to inform the Senate that it is his intention to appoint an additional judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court based in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He further informs me that in view of the situation in Tasmania, where there is only one judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court resident in Tasmania, it has been the practice where there is a bank-up of unheard cases to send one of the judges in Victoria on circuit to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason why we left was because my <span class="highlight">family</span> were kicked off in 1957 after we had some trouble there and a few other families were also put off the Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, when the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty made recommendations concerning <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances it equally as firmly recommended the provision of further proper child care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Arguments have been put, I know, that the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme somehow makes it unnecessary to increase dependent childrens allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The full implications of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, the income test and the automatic adjustment of pensions will make a major difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can only conclude with what we have always known to be true, namely, that from the days of Alfred Deakin to the time of the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, it has always been the Liberal Party which has introduced the major initiatives, that most major welfare benefits in this country have come from our side of politics and will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They had done very little about <span class="highlight">family</span> planning before and are not, under the influence of groups such as the Womens Action Alliance, likely to do anything about <span class="highlight">family</span> planning in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department undertook a comprehensive examination of both the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program (which provides funds for non-clinical expenditure) and the health program grant (which provides funds for clinical expenditure). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government will continue to provide adequate financial assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An amount of $750,000 has been included in my Department’s 1976-77 budget under the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program for research and educational programs, for support of the two national <span class="highlight">family</span> planning organisations and for support of the non-clinical activities of the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1 October 1976 the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations will continue to receive health program grants on the basis of a deficit funding of clinical services after allowing for medical benefits and other related revenue received until 30 June 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each Association will be charging a fee-for-service for scheduled services for those patients who are privately insured, except where recourse to fund benefit is not possible because the clients are ‘unbillable’ through reluctance to utilise <span class="highlight">family</span> cover etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reports in Western Australia that the Government would not renew financial assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning association are therefore inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 26 May, without having received any representations from a member of Parliament, the Minister made a decision to allow a <span class="highlight">family</span> to stay in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act came into operation the Australian Legal Aid Office was referring almost 3500 people each month to private practitioners for legal aid under the scheme, and it was expected that the new Act would more than double the demand for the services, which of course it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another development in the area of legal aid to which the Government has not given proper recognition in its allocation, and that is the implementation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Government set up the Australian Legal Aid Office the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act had not been passed and people were not coming to the Legal Aid Office to seek assistance under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has now been passed and people are seeking assistance under that Act from the Australian Legal Aid Office to such an extent that now the majority of the funds allocated for legal aid is being used on <span class="highlight">family</span> law cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia 80 per cent of legal aid funds are now going for <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales 70 per cent of legal aid funds are now going for <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish these remarks to sound as though I am in any way critical of the fact that people can now have access to low cost or free legal advice and assistance under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whereas the Labor Government would have anticipated the increased demands on the Australian legal aid office services through the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, the present Government has made no such recognition and has not allocated funds accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has ignored the special needs arising from the passage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any housewife can tell honourable senators opposite, if they will listen, the position when she went about trying to keep her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact the drift was much more than that because 2302 votes went to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Action Movement, 474 went to the Democratic Labor Party and 233 went to the Workers Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A certain <span class="highlight">family</span> arrived in Australia from Italy in 1937. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two more children were bom to that <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia during the war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and his <span class="highlight">family</span> then have to be sustained from the public purse anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One man with 8 children in his <span class="highlight">family</span> went in to the powder magazine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is where my <span class="highlight">family</span> grew up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One low income <span class="highlight">family</span> with 6 children had a rent increase from $19.40 a week to $29.40 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a very low income <span class="highlight">family</span> with a lot of children which is faced with a 50 per cent increase in rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another low income <span class="highlight">family</span> earning $126 a week with an unemployed husband has had its rent increased from $16.20 to $32 a week- nearly a 100 per cent increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, they have told me that they intend to send me evidence of particular cases in which they think that because of <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances an ex-serviceman should have been admitted by the medical officer immediately, as was the case formerly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For benefits of up to $76 a day in a private hospital, which will cover accommodation charges in most private hospitals, the additional premium costs with Medibank Private are 80c a week for a single person or $ 1 .60 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be implicit in what I have said so far, but I should make it clear, that the present Bill would in no way affect the functions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She goes on to advise Medibank levy payers to take out intermediate hospital cover with Medibank Private and assures them that it will cost them only $135 a year for <span class="highlight">family</span> cover and $67 a year for single cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Attorney-General been drawn to a Press report concerning delays in the hearing of applications under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in Victoria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges in Melbourne are certainly faced with a very heavy volume of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney has already indicated- I think I have already said this in the Senate on his behalf- that he is considering the appointment of further judges to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The accommodation which was arranged by the previous Government for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Melbourne provided space for only 6 judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that there are those within the Australian community who say that there should be 2 incomes in a <span class="highlight">family</span> in order to overcome the shortage of funds in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the public sector housing insufficient priority is given to the old, the large <span class="highlight">family</span> groups, the low income groups and the desertees- those who are unable to cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It then goes on to talk about State guarantees of loans, the encouragement of cooperative housing societies, repayments being geared to incomes, the deposit home scheme and the reduction of weekly payments, geared to income and <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments, exempting couples from stamp duty on their first home, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My name is Luis A.

    <p>One of those shares was, ironically and oddly enough, held by the Premier of Western Australia in his <span class="highlight">family</span> company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet with that $2 share he was able to exercise complete control over the assets and income of that <span class="highlight">family</span> company and to appropriate, if he chose to do so, the entire assets and income of that company for himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember, when returning from a visit to some of the fruit growing areas during the last winter recess, drawing my <span class="highlight">family</span>’s attention to the fact that farmers were not even bothering to remove the fruit from the trees when families were paying 10c, 12c or 14c each for apples and pears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not like to see a man lose his property but it is fairly obvious that in some areas, particularly in the Centre, some properties will have to combine so that one <span class="highlight">family</span> can have a decent living and others can be given assistance with retraining and support to help them move elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance is described as a series of regular, periodic payments made directly to a <span class="highlight">family</span> or eligible individual unable to afford a decent home in a suitable living environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The amount which will be paid will be determined on <span class="highlight">family</span> need- I assume that that is <span class="highlight">family</span> size and <span class="highlight">family</span> income- in relation to the cost of a standard existing house or flat in a modest neighbourhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The professed aim of the scheme is for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to be allowed to choose its house or flat, for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to be given assistance by the Government and for the Government to have a secondary or what is called an enabling role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has to pay for rented accommodation his outlays with all the other outlays for his <span class="highlight">family</span> are very high and he is going to be hard pressed to save at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-During question time yesterday  Senator Donald  Cameron asked me a question about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He asked whether <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and additional pensions and benefits for student children ceased when a student left school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response is that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments to school leavers who are not permanently employed will be continued during the school vacation and there is therefore no inconsistency with the Government policy not to regard school leavers as unemployed for unemployment benefit purposes until the end of the school vacation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in view of the practice adopted in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, payment of additional pension and additional benefit in respect of school leavers will now be continued until they commence permanent employment or become eligible for payment of unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a decision of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, of which I was advised by letter dated 25 May 1976, that  Mr G.  O.

    <p>There is also the type of Aboriginal who receives welfare housing because of his <span class="highlight">family</span> income or the lack of opportunities making it impossible for him to pay rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Department of Aboriginal Affairs investigated the claims made by the Campbell <span class="highlight">family</span> in September 1976 that it owns Huskisson, a town south of Nowra in New South Wales, because they are the direct descendants of the Duke of Argyll -who originally owned the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I subsequently answered his question by saying that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments to school leavers who are not permanently employed will be continued during the school vacation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I informed him that it was not formerly the practice to make a payment of additional pension or benefit to a child over the age of 16 years who has left school, but in view of the practice that we have now adopted in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, we will in future ensure that the payment of the additional pension and the additional benefit in respect of school leavers will be continued until they commence permanent employment or become eligible to receive the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the inquiry made by  Senator Donald  Cameron this matter was investigated because it could have caused an inconsistency between our treatment of the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and dependant allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Household support is a new form of assistance designed to provide help for up to one year to farmers who are judged to be non-viable and who have insufficient resources to meet living expenses and who are in need of assistance to alleviate conditions of personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> hardship while the farmer considers whether to adjust out of farming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for  Senator Wright  to poohpooh and carry on but he is not concerned about the future of the dairy industry if he is still thinking in terms of the traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he knew anything about the industry he would know that the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm is a dying institution and that if farmers are to survive, particularly those in the dairy industry, some other pattern must be evolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a number of decisions, such as the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, full personal tax indexation, the investment allowance, and the allocation of moneys to Aboriginal and welfare programs, the Government has moved to help the sectors of the community hit hardest by inflation, and to encourage activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the crisis on the land had deepend we have seen the farmer and his <span class="highlight">family</span> turn to off-farm sources of income in an endeavour to stay on their properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a new and very worthwhile provision which, in the terms of the agreement, will provide assistance for up to one year to non-viable farmers having insufficient resources to meet living expenses and who are in need of assistance to alleviate conditions of personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> hardship while they decide whether to adjust out of farming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test of eligibility in this case, as provided by the agreement, is that the applicant must be assessed as nonviable in the long term, must be unable to obtain financial assistance from any normal source, as I mentioned earlier, and will suffer personal or <span class="highlight">family</span> hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has always been my belief that the maintenance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a basic unit of society is essential to our way of life in our Australian democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The happy <span class="highlight">family</span> life of Her Majesty the Queen affords us an opportunity of restating those sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in Australia today there are ominous signs that we are moving or that we have already moved to a serious situation in the breakdown of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a unit in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress these things because, without appearing sanctimonious, I point out that from the biblical days of Sodom and Gomorrah history is strewn with the wrecks of civilisations which failed to recognise the fundamental necessity for selfdiscipline in matters which touch on the sanctity of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and on the maintenance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a unit in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So if we accept the 1975 figures for marriages celebrated we are looking at a figure of up to 50 per cent of those marriages which are celebrated in Australia being dissolved by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, in many cases a short time after they have been celebrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These figures indicate that the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a unit in society may well be on the way to complete disintegration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A straw sample of parents, which bears no relationship to the number of children a <span class="highlight">family</span>, shows that in a number of working families no arrangements were made for the care of 43 700 children; 53 200 children were left in the care of friends and relatives while other arrangements were made for 13 500 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statistics which I have quoted in some detail are all the more alarming when we look at them in terms of preserving the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as basic to the welfare of our democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great deal of juvenile crime, drug addiction and criminality generally can be traced to the almost physical disintegration of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a functioning social mechanism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, in the current climate of unemployment one would think that women with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities should be discouraged from entering the work force unless doing so is a matter of economic necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some more positive steps could be expected from government by way of allowances to a <span class="highlight">family</span> where the wife and mother is not engaged in outside employment but is totally absorbed in her duties in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The extension of government activity into the social services field has been precipitated by the breakdown in <span class="highlight">family</span> life and by the increasing necessity to provide social service amenities for the products of broken homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should alert the Government to contrast the increasing costs in this area with its financial commitment to those fortunate children and parents who have the advantage of a contented and happy <span class="highlight">family</span> background, which fortunately is still the case in the majority of families in Australia, and who do not cost the Government one cent apart from the universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge the great step forward by our Government in providing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which help families in the lower income group who previously, because their incomes were so low and families so large, did not get the benefit of taxation deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now urge it to investigate the payment of an allowance to the woman who chooses to devote all of her time to her vocation of wife and mother, particularly in cases where the <span class="highlight">family</span> is in straitened economic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a man is genuinely unemployed and has a <span class="highlight">family</span> to support, I believe that he is entitled to social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall that a young man I know very well from a <span class="highlight">family</span> I know very well applied for a job as a labourer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first was the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which was introduced last year and which we did not oppose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps my final comment should be that one of the big difficulties has been that in Aboriginal families, including the extended <span class="highlight">family</span>, there is no study orientation to impel the child from the home to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to people who elect to be unemployed, it is much more beneficial to society to have such people unemployed than to have them employed in industry and taking the place, perhaps, of an individual or of a married man with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities who does not wish to be unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he ever seen a person who has been unemployed look throughout the day for a job and at the end of that day not only have to queue up for a meal but take his <span class="highlight">family</span> as well so that they can have a decent meal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The constitutional monarch in the Australian context stands as a symbol of unity and as a symbol of the strength of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Tehan  and others have said in this debate, the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is, hopefully, still the basic unit of the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that in my view the development of marketing corporations of massive capacity was one move which would see the survival and growth of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm, the small unit and the small business in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to recall that some 96 per cent of primary industry in Australia is in the hands of <span class="highlight">family</span> and small company operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, this matter concerns mainly the <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, 96 per cent of Australian primary industry is conducted by the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit or is a <span class="highlight">family</span> operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of estate duty and the establishment of marketing corporations are significant and necessary prerequisites for the continuing development of primary industry, the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm and the small business operation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I knew him and his wife when they were first married and I saw their little <span class="highlight">family</span> come along. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reply I received from that woman was symbolic of the attitude of the Armstrong <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate was on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was being debated in the other chamber I was driving my car in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He spoke of the decline in the income of the man on the land, the decline in his living standards and his need to be assured that there is a future on the land for him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and that they can plan with confidence for that future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This benefit was increased to realistic proportions only last year by this Government with the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which was designed particularly to help low income families, large families and the families of the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a great step forward in providing support for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were no age or invalid pensions and no <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This philosophy may be all very well when it is applied to the wealthy but when it is applied to the thrifty, to the <span class="highlight">family</span> which has gone without over the years, to the <span class="highlight">family</span> which has provided for its own home, for better opportunities for the children, for retirement and generally for their priorities, and when 50 per cent of the interest their savings earn is taken in income tax, there is no justification for supporting those who will not work or the spendthrifts who live for the day with no thought of their responsibilities for tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme places in every mothers hands an allowance to spend as she thinks is best for the welfare of her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have introduced a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which, one would gather,  Senator McAuliffe  does not support or approve but of which we are very proud as it is one of the most radical and necessary social welfare initiatives introduced in this country in a quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>where the occasional honours and glories, which may be rich, are often bought at the cost of painful sacrifice: sacrifice of leisure, sacrifice of <span class="highlight">family</span> life (attested by the growing toll of broken Westminister marriages), and finally- too often- sacrifice of health and strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In referring to the monarchy, it is interesting to note that the strains put on the position of Governor-General by the matters that led up to the dismissal of the Government in 1975 have so made that office one which can be put under great political pressure as to make it completely untenable in the future for a member of the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The list of accomplishments from personal tax indexation to <span class="highlight">family</span> payments to Aboriginal land rights, referred to in the excellent speech that  Senator Baume  gave to the Senate, stands as a tremendous record accumulated in a very short time in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hand in hand with this problem, this crisis which is coming forward, this breakdown in the <span class="highlight">family</span> which  Senator Tehan  has outlined, is a new cult which is developing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even in the present difficult economic circumstances, Australia has maintained a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy which provides for the entry, with a minimum of formalities, of nominated dependent immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members and parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The man who stays at home all day on unemployment benefits, even with a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> but with the odd moonlighting job round the corner, may be better off than the man who goes to work every day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the last figures that I have been able to obtain, there were approximately 3 800 000 working <span class="highlight">family</span> units in Australia and over 2 million of them were 2-income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Walters again got on to the subject of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the question of putting money into the hands of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> does not have enough money to go around, it does not matter in whose hands the money is; the <span class="highlight">family</span> cannot buy the goods and services it needs and the <span class="highlight">family</span> cannot be looked after properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the previous Government the husband of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children received $8.70 tax rebate and $1.50 child endowment, which adds up to $10.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Government’s scheme such a <span class="highlight">family</span> receives no tax rebate and receives a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance of $8.50 which, from what I learned when I went to school even though I did not learn new mathematics, is less than $10.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is outside their life style to register, because they do not get unemployment benefits even though the <span class="highlight">family</span> depends very much on the money they bring in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although Senators Kilgariff and Harradine were busy complaining about abortion lessening the number of people we have in this country to protect us, I was amazed that they and  Senator Walters  did not raise the matter of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had petition after petition in this place asking the Government to fund <span class="highlight">family</span> planning centres, to close the stable door before the horse got out, if that is a suitable metaphor, which I doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may read some of the relevant figures, the centre opened on 6 December 1976 and up to 27 February 1977 it had given contraceptive advice to 230 people and pregnancy counselling to 62 people, leaflets were taken by 120 people, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning appointments were made for 181 people, adolescent counselling was given to 77 people and parent counselling was given to 43 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a great deal of needless anxiety is caused by those who speculate on programs, as people did about this time last year with regard to child endowment which was replaced by the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme and as people did a week or two ago with regard to the indexation of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to recent reports that there are serious delays in the hearing of defended cases before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is not as long as it was in the Supreme Court of Victoria under the Matrimonial Causes Act before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act came into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Presumably, the case could have been dealt with in the Supreme Court under the transitional provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, would the Minister consider a review along the lines of the Government’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme so that more of the taxpayers ‘ money goes directly to the needy instead of in salaries to so-called experts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether we will amend the Act in line with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, there is no real comparison between the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, which is a universal, non-taxable benefit to families and all Australian children, and the organisations which conduct services under the Child Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It bought a house at 12 Moramy Street, Bairnsdale, for $27,000 and then took out the floor, the bath, the stove and some of the internal walls at a cost of about $8,000 and made the house all electric despite the plea by the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> to leave a slow combustion stove in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the opportunity of speaking on the first reading of the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Amendment Bill 1977 to bring before the Parliament the situation of the administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concept of a ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> court’ is well established in the United States of America, Canada and Japan though there are variations in the proceedings and powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It generally involves the creation of a special court (or division of a larger court), the assimilation of all <span class="highlight">family</span> matters into one court, with active pre-divorce and post-divorce counselling not merely to assist reconciliation, but also to provide for the  reduciton  of bitterness and distress and in alleviating ongoing post-divorce problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of the essence of our recommendation that the Judges appointed to this Court (men and women) should be chosen for their experience and understanding of <span class="highlight">family</span> problems and should be drawn from existing Judges, members of the bar and solicitors, according to their particular suitability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That article in the  Sun  was written by  Mr Ian  Kennedy who is  president  of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Association of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Association has been formed only recently and <span class="highlight">family</span> lawyers have been joining it at a very rapid rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The two extra judges who were added to the list at Christmas, bringing the number of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges in Victoria to nine, are obviously not enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further additions to the judicial ranks are needed, and needed urgently, if the high hopes held of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are to be realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following figures were extracted from the records of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court at Melbourne as at the 1st day of March, 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present there are 2 defended lists in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, one being a list entitled the “Defended List” in which there are now 700 cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various estimates have been made as to the numberof additional Judges required by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the most conservative estimate appears to be 5 additional Judges appointed immediately would enable the total Court to just keep abreast of the business being carried out on a daytoday basis in that Court, without in effect reducing the delays <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the commencment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act there were 48 Magistrates spending an average of 2 full days each week hearing <span class="highlight">family</span> matters (maintenance, custody etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the foregoing means that prior to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 17-18 courts were at any one time engaged in hearing matters now dealt with by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court Judges are now sitting from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. daily and often longer, and if they adopted the Supreme Court hours, the lists would be immeasurably worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Friday last  Mr Philip  Ruddock, the member for Parramatta, and I spent the day at the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court at Parramatta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I formed the impression that what was happening in the Parramatta <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court constituted the type of helping court, the type of unit operation, which was in accordance with the ideas which the Senate Committee had when it started its inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before leaving the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court at Parramatta I obtained some statistics as to the cases which have been held there and the extent to which counselling and conferences have occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention has been drawn to the fact that there is some difference of opinion between the judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a court which actively intervenes on its own motion to protect the interests of the parties and their children, is not supported by the Full Court which, more cautiously, takes the traditional approach that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court acts as an  arbitor  between disputing adversary parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doubtful whether the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court as yet possesses the necessary expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever might have happened in some appeals I believe he is pursuing the type of approach which was intended in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there are not nearly as many judges dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters as there were under the provisions of the old Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us in the Parliament who passed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and who had an indea and, I hope, a vision of what it could involve must ensure that it does not become just another matrimonial course on the dreary pattern of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has naturally decided to retain the provision allowing a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a person on whom a Service decoration has been conferred to wear that decoration, provided he does not represent himself as being the person on whom the decoration was conferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister not concerned that such an imposition could discourage many persons with low disposable incomes from seeking medical treatment, particular/y if they have one or more members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> chronically ill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought not to forget, in the process of observing all these things that institutions are all very well and they do a tremendous job, the Australians who person by person, <span class="highlight">family</span> by <span class="highlight">family</span>, go out and do things in under-developed countries as individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, the comment that at present there is a backlog of one month’s work in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances section is not quite correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They relate to the extent to which the applicant’s previous income and any other income the person or his <span class="highlight">family</span> is currently receiving should limit the level of income support that would be paid in unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we examine that as related to a <span class="highlight">family</span>, we would need to remember that support is added to that for a wife and for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that certain anomalies in legislation are putting the private centres at a disadvantage compared with the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is she aware, for example, that no equipment subsidy is provided for private centres but is provided- in fact, everything is provided- for <span class="highlight">family</span> day care institutions; that the needy parent subsidy applies in the case of children in <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres but not in the case of private centres; that no standards are set by State legislation for <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres- for example, not even a telephone is required to deal with an emergency; and that no safety regulations at present apply in the case of <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres but private centres and the community subsidised centres are covered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that to some degree this is as a result of there not being State legislation to cover <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will she please take up these anomalies and will she indicate, if the States are unwilling to act, that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to look at these areas with a view to determining future planning in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Different types of grants are given to <span class="highlight">family</span> day care programs under the children services program; there are equipment grants and operational assistance grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> day care was an innovation of the former Government to provide a means of caring for a very limited number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In one <span class="highlight">family</span> there may be 4 people of working age and another person who is denned as a septuagenarian who would be in receipt of some form of superannuation from the Portuguese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Guilfoyle  would know, the incomes of those people say, between the ages of 25 and 35 are lumped together when assessing social security rights of another member of the same <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I take up with  Senator Guilfoyle  is that in cases like this, which will be intensified with <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions, we ought to have a clear cut understanding with the Portuguese Government that if people come to Australia who are more than 65 years of age their cheques will continue to flow from Lisbon or, conversely, if that is not satisfactory I think we should examine further the formula whereby we lump together three or four people in a <span class="highlight">family</span> who may be working as domestics and whose salaries are not very high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the immigration criteria will not be confined merely to what may be described as the close <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship criteria which we use in respect of so many other migrants to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that these criteria will be interpreted in a wider fashion because of the responsibilities which people will have for elderly members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> who may be more distant relations than a mother or a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They expressed the view that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  surely could not understand what the Chinese meant by <span class="highlight">family</span> when he had made a limitation to what we understand perhaps in Australia as the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect on employees in terms of social and <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption is of course quite considerable, but the point which has to be made is whether in the free market society in which  Senator Cotton  believes we live, companies should be able to operate to the detriment of the social welfare of individuals employed in an industry such as this and should be able to behave in the manner in which this company has behaved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As late as this week I got a letter from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  which indicated that an application could be successful where somebody is sponsoring a migrant to come to Australia on the basis of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is equally true that concern has been expressed by the ethnic communities as to the number of people designated as political refugees and as to whether the number of people allowed into Australia in a year for <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A poor <span class="highlight">family</span>- a very poor <span class="highlight">family</span> with perhaps one wage earner who was on unemployment benefits himself- was expected to support a school leaver, despite the fact that that school leaver was desperately trying to find work, was available for work and was fulfilling every criterion under the Act but was knocked out, firstly, by the restrictive definitions of ‘eligibility’ which were introduced by the Government and, secondly, by the ludicrously hard hardship conditions, the absurd hardship conditions which were applied to unemployed school leavers before they could receive special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recently as 6 April in his message to the nation the Prime Minister said that a government is like a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and that a <span class="highlight">family</span> which spends too much finishes up in debt to the bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this analogy between a deficit recorded by a government and an overdraft or money borrowed from a bank by an individual or a <span class="highlight">family</span> is a favourite analogy of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before dealing with those I think it is important to highlight, with regard to education in a debate of this kind, that in the developments in the structure of education and the growing interest in new concepts and new styles of education- open education, recurrent education, retraining and the growing importance of the recognition of technical and further education- there is the whole matter of the relevance of education to a person’s working life, social life and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite ludicrous to look only at wage levels in assessing living standards, thereby neglecting, for example, the fundamental influences acting to increase <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes such as the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here is a woman with 4 children still waiting to receive that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which she had been receiving for her eldest child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to deliberate too long on this matter tonight because I think the Minister is well aware- I am pleased that she is in the chamber tonight- of the problems that are being experienced by many people  in the community, not only  the recipients of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments but also the recipients of other social service benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime she has to suffer the inconvenience of not being paid the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for her oldest child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator MsLaren raised a matter relating to my own Department and the difficulties and delays with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in Mount Gambier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the matter to which  Senator McLaren  referred specifically is given to my office I will see what can be done to facilitate a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment for the person mentioned in Mount Gambier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that the Department makes about 2 million <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments and about 325 000 student endowment payments to families at either 4-weekly or quarterly intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That increase in staff is aimed at providing additional resources to relieve pressures being experienced in the Department in handling heavy work loads in the pensions, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and unemployment and sickness benefit areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the basis of the information and advice obtained in these discussions, I have agreed that a further review of the question of Australian participation be made in 1 977-78, in the light of fertility data that will become available from various sources including the 1976 Census, a survey of binh expectations conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in November, 1 976, and a <span class="highlight">family</span> survey soon to be conducted by the Department of Demography of the Australian National University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-46-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators who were members of this chamber in 1 974 will recall that the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs brought down a report on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, then before the Senate, that was responsible for the insertion in the Bill of provision for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recommending the creation of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the Committee expressed concern that if it were a federal court the judges would have to be appointed for life, because it felt that judges of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should not continue to adjudicate when of advanced years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this amendment, which is now section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court created pursuant to this provision may not exercise jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act unless, amongst other things, judges of the Court are to retire by the age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia, which has been established pursuant to section 4 1 , have a retiring age of 65. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recognise that this requirement, having been approved by both Houses of the Parliament, provides a compelling reason for prescribing an identical retiring age forjudges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, now that the Constitution alteration has made this possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the report of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on a retiring age for federal judges, which led to the Constitution alteration, specifically recommended 65 as an appropriate age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the proposal to amend the Constitution to provide for the retirement of Federal judges was raised, and before the referendum on the Constitution alteration in May, the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  made known his preference for a retirement age of 65 years forjudges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senators will also, of course, be well aware that 65 years is the maximum retiring age for the great majority of employees and office-holders in Australia, including the holders of non-judicial offices of comparable status to that of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is generally conceded that in <span class="highlight">family</span> law, more than in most other areas of the law, judges adjudicating over disputes should be aware of and keep abreast of current social values and attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, and also because of the demanding and arduous nature of at least some of the disputes- notably, defended custody disputes- there seems to be good reason for requiring judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to retire at least by the age recognised as the maximum retiring age for most other occupations in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, this Bill prescribes the age of 65 years as the maximum retiring age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since all the existing judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia were appointed before that date, the maximum retiring age prescribed by the Bill will apply only to future appointees to the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill makes two other amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By virtue of an amendment earlier this year to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law (Judges) Regulations, up to six additional judges may be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why, even with our present technology, the second <span class="highlight">family</span> car should not be an electric vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If every member of this chamber and every <span class="highlight">family</span> associated with them used one electric light where now five or six electric lights are burning at night, used one gas jet where now two or three gas jets are turned on, and if we set out on a real energy conservation campaign, we would cut drastically the amount of liquid fuels that we are using at present, particularly the derivatives of fossil fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to a <span class="highlight">family</span> man who was sentenced to nine months’ gaol by a magistrate in South Australia because he gave wrong information in obtaining unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was receiving unemployment benefits from August 1975 until June 1976 when his unemployment benefits were suspended because he would not accept employment under a scheme which meant that he would be separated from his <span class="highlight">family</span> for a quite considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the Minister’s attention a case which has come to my notice where the breadwinner of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the wife, a school teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has made the decision that the husband will remain at home to care for the children and keep house while the wife works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is that when the wife made application for the allocation of a government home she was refused on the ground that the male is regarded as the breadwinner, regardless of any decision made by the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of the Northern Territory follows the well established practice of regarding the male of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as the breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exceptions to that rule could result from a variety of factors, ranging from physical incapacity of the male through to a break-up of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reginald Francis Xavier Connor, a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales from 1950 to 1963 and a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Cunningham from 1963 and a Minister of the Crown from 1972 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of the Government senators I express our deepest sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Opposition I indicate our sympathy to members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> today when we grieve the loss of a great Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who relied on him, those who knew him so well, the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, his friends and colleagues will miss him greatly but remember him with pride and affection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a great parent to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and a great husband to his wife whom unfortunately he lost earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On an occasion like this when we all feel so sad about his passing, we can feel assured that if there is such a thing as everlasting life it comes when a man writes his name into his <span class="highlight">family</span> and into the affairs of his fellow men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not wear them myself, but on given occasions members of my <span class="highlight">family</span> do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our handling of refugees from Lebanon was criticised, especially in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I think we must realise that different standards apply, especially to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do this so that he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> will not be caused any embarrassment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would this situation not have been overcome if <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances had been increased? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Government not increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in the present Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system was not indexed in the present Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not a commitment of Government, when the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced, that it would be indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That raises quite serious problems in terms of <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships and matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the same Treasurer and the same Prime Minister are on the record as having attacked the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for applying the principles of full indexation, and in this very Budget tax indexation is to be halved for the 1978 financial year, no steps are being taken to index the spouse allowance in respect of the current year, and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have not been indexed either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest failure of all is their leader, the economic neanderthal man who believes that deficits must be paid back like an overdraft, who believes that a nation which runs a deficit Budget, to use his own words must go without for the next few years while it pays back the deficit just like a <span class="highlight">family</span> that establishes an overdraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to say something about this Bill which, of course, amends one particular aspect of this legislation, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the opportunity which the Parliament now has under the Constitution to fix a retiring age of 65 years for <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the constitutional amendment of May 1977, this is something which can be done so far is the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that one should say a few things about some other aspects of the administration and current state of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Australia while a Bill of this type is being discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the first reading stage of that Bill I made a speech about <span class="highlight">family</span> law administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that speech I endeavoured to say something about the situation at that time concerning the operations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, this runs completely contrary to what the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was intended to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of his honor’s call-over his honor declined to fix more than 3 days for a case, even though in practice a ‘day’ in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court means only 2 hours to  2Vi  hours, and most defended custody matters would take 10 to 15 hours of hearing, and frequently more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia started with a clean slate in January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would submit for your urgent consideration that the number of judges for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court sitting in New South Wales needs to be increased to 20 immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to your letter of 9 February 1977 on behalf of the <span class="highlight">family</span> Law Practitioners Association of New South Wales concerning delays in the hearing of cases in the Sydney Registry of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I share your concern at the amount of work with which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Sydney is confronted and the resultant time people have to wait for their cases to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so despite the fact that a total of 30 Judges have been appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court so far, including  Mr Justice  Cook and  Mr Justice  Yuill to the Sydney and Parramatta Registries since the date of your letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of my concern at the delays, I have recently completed a review of the judicial workload of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, with a view to expediting the disposal of matters before the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law (Judges) Regulations have just been amended to allow the appointment of up to 6 more Judges, who I expect would be appointed in the next 6 to 1 2 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, action is currently being taken to recruit further court counsellors and legal officers to the major <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court registries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional legal officers will share the work of the Registrar in conducting conferences with parties to attempt to reach a settlement under regulation 96 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Regulations, and in conducting financial inquiries under regulation 99. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have recently received a report on the matter from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council, and have asked my Department to prepare for my consideration amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Regulations that would enable the courts to dispose of cases in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Practitioners Association, c/0 Mr P. 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of judges that can be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has been increased from 30 to 36. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures sound extraordinarily high but one must realise that, before we had a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, in New South Wales there was the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division of the Supreme Court with five or six judges and magistrates were doing much more substantial <span class="highlight">family</span> law work throughout the State and now they are doing much less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria before the Act came into force there were something like 20 judges or magistrates working on <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters on any one day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas there had been perhaps 20 people dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters now there are nine judges in Victoria at the present time handling or trying to handle this work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, an increase in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court expenditure but there is another aspect which I think is somewhat regrettable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference is made to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council which in 1976-77 had a Budget appropriation of $25,000, of which only $5,949 was spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council is an important body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not cover all the extremities of views of organisations that are connected with an interested in <span class="highlight">family</span> law but it is a body which is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies is a professional body, designed to look at the statistics and at the situation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life in Australia and to try to assist not only the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council but also, I presume, the Government in the administration of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be explanations for this situation but I suggest that, at a period when there is quite a considerable crisis in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law situation in Australia, it is regrettable to see reductions of that sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one other aspect I want to raise at this stage in this preliminary debate about the <span class="highlight">family</span> law situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that people who practise in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction do not know what their situation is at the present time, what their entitlements are, and their clients do not know what are the amounts that should be charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder why this matter has not been given the clarification which is needed by the people who practise, and who are specialists in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not increase the status of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is, I think, standing up well under very considerable pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is however, a very disappointing Act to this stage because of the great delay in the hearing of cases, the inadequate number of judges and staff and the inability to achieve the potential which it has and the potential which should be achieved by those organisations, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, of which I have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other things in connection with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act shall need very close attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen raised a number of important matters concerning the administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill which provides for the retirement at 65 years of age of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will facilitate the appointment of new judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the very high level and the maintenance of that level until well into this year was a surprise although I agree it was to be expected that there would be a great increase because of the new provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has told us that it wants to see <span class="highlight">family</span> units settled in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people believe that she should be reunited with her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the illness and subsequent death of members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> in India, the couple returned to their native land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that on the basis of reuniting a <span class="highlight">family</span> group a residential permit would have been made available, particularly as one daughter agrees to go guarantor for fares, accommodation and living costs in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Seed  is very anxious to have his son nearby as he needs <span class="highlight">family</span> support to help him cope with the strain of caring for his wife Lily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that it would help her greatly if her son and his <span class="highlight">family</span> could be reunited with her and her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that this would help to restore their <span class="highlight">family</span> unity and it would certainly help  Mrs Seed  to build up her general selfconfidence which she needs to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr and Mrs Seed do not qualify for entry under the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy, which provides only for the entry of spouses, dependent children and parents of persons already resident here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Applicants who do not qualify under the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy may be considered for entry only if they are in occupations for which there is an unfilled demand within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the present economic situation, I can only come to the conclusion that the possibility of attaining the economic viability which would enable the <span class="highlight">family</span>, as an independent unit, to live at an acceptable standard without recourse to government assistance can only be rated as poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only was  Mr Haylen  a member of this Parliament for the Division  of  Parkes for  20  years from  1943  to  1963,  but proudly I state that he, his wife Sylvia and his sons, Ron and Wayne, were close personal friends  of  mine and of my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator Douglas  McClelland would agree with me that in the vital national election campaigns in  1969, 1972, 1974  and  1975-I  think this is the nicest comment that I can personally apply to Les Haylen- Les Haylen did not feel it infra dig to be out on the street corners in the electorate of Evans where his <span class="highlight">family</span> lived putting a point of view to the people on the kerbside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To his <span class="highlight">family</span>, who lived with him in Summer Hill for a great number of years, I extend not only my own personal sympathies and condolences in their sad loss but also those of all members of the Parliament and certainly all members of my own party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only express the hope that the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> will draw some consolation from the  fact that the prestige which Les enjoyed in the Parliament has been recorded today in the expressions of condolence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That is done upon the death of certain heads of state, Governors-General, members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>, former Prime Ministers, whom I think fall within this category, and sitting honourable senators and honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is housing that they want to design for themselves in conformity with the way in which they live in the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They applied to have eight houses built by themselves, designed to suit their needs and their extended <span class="highlight">family</span> lifestyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme and personal tax indexation, at a cost of some billion dollars, were the first of these moves forward in the taxation field which is extraordinarily important in a free enterprise society because, basic to it, is initiative and reward for ininativethe capacity of people to have sufficient money left to them to exercise their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course speakers on this side of the House have indicated today the types of things which we claim have been of great value in an economic sensethe investment allowance, the various changes in the law and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which has been a contribution to expenditure by - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change from the extended biological <span class="highlight">family</span> to the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> which has occurred this century and the apparently irreversible but regrettable failure of people to be willing to care for their aged relatives has led to the situation in this country of aged people too often being placed in institutions such as nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to flats that can be added to houses which provide the aged person with accommodation near his <span class="highlight">family</span> but not in the <span class="highlight">family</span> home because most <span class="highlight">family</span> homes in Australia are just not suited to take extra people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases aged people, I repeat, are looked after by <span class="highlight">family</span> and by neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dremmel <span class="highlight">family</span>, of which 1 am sure the Minister is well aware- a <span class="highlight">family</span> with many children and many problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister has now widened eligibility for the handicapped children’s allowance to assist low income families, does she envisage this extending to families like the Dremmel <span class="highlight">family</span> which has children with heart troubles, asthma and other physical problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any situations where such a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which the father is working can receive special benefit under the discretion available to the Director-General of Social Services, or is special benefit merely restricted in all cases to families which have almost no income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are talking about one particular <span class="highlight">family</span>, I inform the Senate that if any member of that <span class="highlight">family</span> were able to be considered for the handicapped child’s allowance under the new criteria it would certainly be open to the <span class="highlight">family</span> to apply and the DirectorGeneral could consider whether the child fell within the new terms of that allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would assure  Senator Grimes  that any children in the <span class="highlight">family</span> which he mentioned who may be eligible for the handicapped child’s allowance could be considered if an application were received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the facts that the 1976-77 appropriation for the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, to be set up under the terms of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975, was almost entirely unspent in that financial year and that the proposed appropriation for 1977-78 has been reduced from $80,000 to $50,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate what steps have been taken to secure the appointment of a Director and suitable staff for the proposed Institute and to enable it to perform the important duties assigned to it by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government attaches great significance to the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the sake of people listening to this debate, I should like-to clarify the claim that somehow the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance should satisfy supporting mothers who are seeking to rear children alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No longer was one income enough for one <span class="highlight">family</span>; there had to be a two income <span class="highlight">family</span> in order to keep pace with the incredible materialism that was inflicted on this community during the 23 years of Liberal- Country Party rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I find most appalling is that this Government, which is so pleased to spout constantly sentiments about the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and so forth, does not recognise the difficulties when a dual low income <span class="highlight">family</span> is deprived of one income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just as the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances introduced by the Budget last year were designed to assist people on low incomes, so in this Budget, by reason of the taxation exemption to $3,750 a year for a single taxpayer or in the case of a taxpayer with a dependent spouse, a taxation exemption to $5,480, some 225,000 Australians now paying tax, many of them being pensioners and young people, under our scheme will pay no tax at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is noted that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, a very valuable initiative introduced in the previous Budget, are paid universally and without a means test and amount this year to $ 1,049m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard  Senator Tehan  say a while ago that the Government had done a wonderful thing for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man by increasing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government certainly increased the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, but a husband cannot now claim a rebate in his taxation return for his dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Minister of several questions asked of her in the autumn session relating to a visa application by  Mr Chris  Santos and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have not received any reply to my questions relating to the Santos <span class="highlight">family</span>, I now ask: What stage of consideration has the case reached? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will the Government make a decision on this case and end the months of concern of the Santos <span class="highlight">family</span> due to the delay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I recall the questions that were asked with regard to the Santos <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part, I hope we will be able to expand it because it is the one way in which we can generate very genuine concern for those people who are under privileged and, at the same time, learn ourselves where the community, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the education system are in defect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one considers what this Government has been doing in its period in office in increasing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, in helping people with large families, in helping people who are really in need and in helping people to pay rent and provide them with housing and so forth, one realises the enormous increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>He talked about the responsibility which he felt the <span class="highlight">family</span> should share in and said, I repeat: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason, of course, is the right of every person to independence … we need to determine a basic philosophy concerning the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> or a society of individuals . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But maybe one parent should- either to care for the younger members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and/or to make way for the younger person in the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately, in my State of Victoria, there has been created in its place a <span class="highlight">family</span> and community services program which is now getting under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year, about $2m is to be spent on developing and expanding in a decentralised way and working with local government, while enabling people in voluntary organisations to be elected to regional councils and to be active in the determination of expenditure on various <span class="highlight">family</span> and community projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also relaxed the means test by increasing the marginally adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income for tertiary education and related schemes and for the additional boarding allowance for isolated children from $8,200 to $8,700 in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These wildcat strikes are hitting right at the roots of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would say that the <span class="highlight">family</span> of such a trade unionist is in a destitute situation and is looking for money to buy a meal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not talking about the <span class="highlight">family</span> person who needs a second position to bring more money into the <span class="highlight">family</span> to keep it going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, I would like to exclude from my remarks the one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> falls into a special category which ought to be dealt with under the social welfare provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend my remarks to be about the one-income <span class="highlight">family</span>, which is the most common arrangement in Australia under which dad works on a taxable income and mum works at home for no taxable income, caring for the home and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, for centuries the division of <span class="highlight">family</span> labour in our world has been for mum to stay at home and care for the <span class="highlight">family</span> while dad goes out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today it seems to me that many forces within our community are endeavouring to discourage this form of <span class="highlight">family</span> structure, and one of them happens to be our taxation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate  Mrs Adamson  and the people in this organisation on their work in connection with this matter and other problems in respect of the one-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my Party’s philosophy to encourage <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is a cohesive force in society and the Liberal Party recognises the necessity for strengthening its influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberals acknowledge the vital contribution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the development of the individual . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That happens in business when <span class="highlight">family</span> partnerships are created but that faculty is not available to the wage and salary earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my Party wishes actively to encourage this form of <span class="highlight">family</span> life I believe it should treat marriage as a partnership for taxation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the wife has a child and decides to remain at home to care for that child the <span class="highlight">family</span> income would be his income only which would be only $8,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, far from offering wives any real advantage to stay at home, in fact it actively encourages them to go out to work, It would be bad enough in the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life if they were on a par, but on this basis they are way behind scratch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am asking for is a fair go for the <span class="highlight">family</span> which decides that Mum should stay home and bring up the kids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a wage adjustment is not an appropriate method of doing equal justice to the single person and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I urge this proposal for the sake of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, not so much for the sake of soaking up the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a job that should be adopted by both husband and wife in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present legislation a wife and mother may feel some pride in her occupation but she will have the lingering worry that while she is not earning a separate income she is a financial burden to her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two income <span class="highlight">family</span> has a considerable tax advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to  Senator Lewis,  although he was not in the Parliament at the time, that the Party to which he belongs was strongly in favour of the present system of advantages to the two-income <span class="highlight">family</span> when we debated the Medibank levy as it was originally proposed by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This problem will be solved I believe by a reformation of the taxation system, by a resolution of the problems in this community and an acceptance of the views of the community as to who is dependent and who is not dependent in the <span class="highlight">family</span> set-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third reason is the failure to increase the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances under the new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme was hailed in this House and other places as the greatest triumph of the last Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it pointed out repeatedly that unless regular increases were made m the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to cope with inflation many people- those people with children- would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure to increase the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances has resulted in those people having a lower disposable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the responsible Minister was asked why the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were not increased to cope with indexation his only reply was that it was not a Government promise to increase these allowances when they were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure to update the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances may cause problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this, together with the Government’s system of industrial confrontation, its determination to cut real wages, its failure to increase payments to those who are in real need such as pensioners with children, and its failure to increase the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in fact will reduce the living standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me this Budget will continue to constrain inflation, restore another further measure of stability to business and <span class="highlight">family</span> groups, and provide an incentive to the production areas to benefit from some inducements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) In view of the judgment of McTiernan, J., that, in the context of the Constitution, ‘marriage’ referred only to monogamous marriages (Attorney-General of Victoria v. The Commonwealth, 1961-62, 107 CL R., page 549) is section 6 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> La w Act 1 975 a valid enactment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 6 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act deems polygamous unions in the nature of marriages that have been entered into outside Australia to be marriages only for the purposes of proceedings under the Act The intention was to enable parties to such unions who have the required jurisdictional connection with Australia to be able to obtain matrimonial relief under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing I must say to the Government that I accept that it is concerned about the unemployment and it is concerned about the unemployment of young people in this country, as it has to be because unemployment of young people is creeping even into its ranks in that even in areas where people were always assured of jobs, such as in companies, <span class="highlight">family</span> companies, firms or with friends, young people now are finding some difficulty in obtaining employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the purely economic impact of unemployment, other effects included ‘disturbance of the person’s relationships with his <span class="highlight">family</span>, other people and the community at large, and apparently severe effects on psychological and even physical well being’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is similarly quite intolerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sincerely hope that it does because small businesses, especially small partnerships or small <span class="highlight">family</span> business concerns, have been in a very bad way in the last couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Naturally, a <span class="highlight">family</span> which requires a rental rebate will have to disclose its income, but this is quite reasonable, considering the large sums of money involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sort of sociological changes I refer to include the very high incidence of two income families, smaller <span class="highlight">family</span> units, the greater mobility of people generally, the fact that the aged are cared for far less at home than they were in 1945 and thereafter, and the fact that a lot of units accommodate young people who would never previously have been away from home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity to say that some of that exploitation of Karen Green by persons for their own motives has been of distress to Karen Green and her <span class="highlight">family</span> to the extent that she has asked members of the Government parties to see that no further personal publicity is given to her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further consideration is that  Mr Justice  Butler has been appointed as a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge resident in northern Tasmania, and that hitherto judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Victoria from time to time rendered assistance in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me refer honourable senators first of all to the case of the  Deputy  Prime Minister of this country  (Mr Anthony)  who, through a very substantial <span class="highlight">family</span> interest in a company known as Northern Star Holdings Ltd, has a controlling interest in television stations NRN11 and RTN8 in northern New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> has a controlling interest in radio stations 4GG on the Gold Coast, 2MW in Murwillumbah and 2LM in Lismore, and in a dozen commercial newspapers in the area between South Brisbane and Coffs Harbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a substantial interest which the  Deputy  Prime Minister of this country, through his <span class="highlight">family</span>, has directly in companies which could bring him in conflict with his public responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown and about which there has not been disclosure presumably to anybody other than to the Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of his <span class="highlight">family</span> holdings perhaps he should have declined to take part when the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">family</span> groups, few in number I am pleased to say, have arranged for unrelated aged people who are expected not to live for any length of time, and who have little in the way of assets of their own, to set up multiple ‘shell’ trusts under a will for the benefit of members of the sponsor <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the death of the aged person, the <span class="highlight">family</span> channels income into these trusts which, because they qualify as deceased estates, are outside the scope of the special rate of tax under section 99a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said there was ‘no way we’d be adopting the picture shown by further analysis of this Budget- namely that <span class="highlight">family</span> people are taking the cost of some alleviation from tax given to single people and high income earners’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the fourth paragraph under the heading ‘Courtesies of Debate’- which I think is a particularly apt heading because matters of courtesy in respect of this subject seem to have gone by the boardafter reference to the use of the name of the sovereign, members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> and the Governor-General, the following statement is made: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>The third point that is made in the amendment is that the Government has failed to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Labor Government introduced the Homeless Persons Assistance Bill in 1974 no Commonwealth assistance had ever been made available for organisations to help the homeless and destitute in the community- those people without secure <span class="highlight">family</span> backgrounds, without means and frequently without self esteem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it extends the eligibility for the handicapped child ‘s allowance to a low-income <span class="highlight">family</span> with a less severely handicapped child when the care of that child, in the words of the Act, is a severe financial handicap to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in a lot of cases a lesser handicap is still a tremendous financial burden on the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of handicap in providing shoes of this type would depend on the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that it depends on the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phenyl ketonuria, as  Senator Grimes  knows, is a great expense to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treatment of the disease is a very expensive business for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether the Government or the Minister has considered the social cost of introducing this provision, whether it has considered the cost to the low income <span class="highlight">family</span> that needs some income from its school leaving children by way of wages or, in the case of unemployed children, by way of unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it considered what will happen to those low income families which have a lot of children to support- perhaps there is sickness in the <span class="highlight">family</span>- and which need to send their teenagers out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a low income <span class="highlight">family</span> with two incomes, when the husband becomes ill and has to leave his employment he will not be eligible for sickness benefit if his wife is working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> would be reduced to about $88 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to be an extremely harsh circumstance to visit upon a dual income <span class="highlight">family</span> in which the husband and wife are both working hard to keep up their payments and meet their commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly, because of the sickness of one party, the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> is reduced to living on $88 a week, with perhaps a supplementary benefit later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that when a working wife does have to give up her job to support her husband her whole <span class="highlight">family</span> goes on to the social security benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that a much fairer way of reconciling the anomaly that existed under the old provision would have been to introduce some sort of provision which would permit either partner to retain eligibility if the <span class="highlight">family</span> income was very low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention that figure to demonstrate to the Senate that the dual income <span class="highlight">family</span> is a fact of life in our community, particularly in the low income areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable senators present tonight might be able to afford not to have a working spouse, but for the low income workers in our community the dual income <span class="highlight">family</span> has become a necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So these provisions which discriminate against the dual income <span class="highlight">family</span> or take no account of the hardship which flows to them when unemployment or sickness prevents one partner from continuing to earn his or her wage are, I think, quite irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not long before the average Australian young couple commences to have a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that it will create <span class="highlight">family</span> breakups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes this is provided through a <span class="highlight">family</span> support scheme or whatever term may be used to describe the immediate assistance that is given in cases of hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if it were not for organisations such as the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span>, the Salvation Army and many others that I could mention, there would be a great number of people suffering day in and out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He described as ‘inhumane’ the Federal Government’s changes to the payment of unemployment scheme under which a newly unemployed <span class="highlight">family</span> man was given one pay in five weeks- on the 18th day of unemployment, then on the 35th day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Walters  spoke to the Bill she tried to recite chapter and verse concerning what this Government had done to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She mentioned the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance as assisting the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, but when recently I spoke on the Budget I mentioned the fact that that allowance penalised certain people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is of great assistance to people on very low incomes, but other people also live in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An allowance will be payable to a parent or guardian where the <span class="highlight">family</span> income does not exceed the adult minimum weekly wage plus $6 for each child or student child of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be of assistance if such a benefit is paid to cover the continuing expenditure which may occur in such a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A low income <span class="highlight">family</span> can be assisted by the payment of a handicapped child’s allowance to cover these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application may be made for special benefit by any student who is in necessitous circumstances or whose <span class="highlight">family</span> is dependent upon his immediately gaining employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter raised, although not in the context of the Bill before the Senate, was that of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the difficulties encountered by some fathers who are paying maintenance for children who no longer are in their custody, care and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced this problem was known to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one means of reviewing the maintenance that he pays in order to take into account the loss of rebate in the form of a taxation deduction which he previously had but which no longer exists because of the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we still have vague expressions in proposed new section 105 ja where a handicapped child’s allowance is not paid if the <span class="highlight">family</span> is ‘by reason of the provision of that care and attention, subjected to severe financial hardship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I stated earlier, this allowance will be payable to a parent or guardian where the <span class="highlight">family</span> income does not exceed the adult minimum weekly wage, plus $6 for each child or student child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if we look at the way in which the change has been made, and that is to test the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, I think we could agree with some of the claims made by  Senator Ryan  in her speechthat there is no real difference in the way in which a woman will be tested for the sickness benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now no difference between the sickness benefit, the unemployment benefit or any other pension administered by my Departmentthey are now all tested on a <span class="highlight">family</span> income basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that the eligibility requirements for a married woman will not change except that eligibility will be subject to a <span class="highlight">family</span> income test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where as a male previously had access to a benefit regardless of the income of his wife he will now be tested on a <span class="highlight">family</span> income basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance about which  Senator Donald  Cameron asked also would be continued during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for a student child, that would be continued until the period of non-payment of the unemployment benefit was covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers that a child of a person receiving the unemployment benefit is going to be considered by the Government to be satisfactorily paid if his or her parent receives the children’s allowance plus the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, which might add up to about $7 or $8 a week, one can imagine what sort of restrictions are going to be applied before anyone will be eligible for special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was my understanding it was the <span class="highlight">family</span> of one, I think, perhaps the wife or a trust organisation of  Mr Phillip  Lynch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer appears to have used the legal devices of nominee companies and <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts to screen his involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I ask these questions: Is it a fact that Stumpy Gully Estates, the land in which the Treasurer or his <span class="highlight">family</span> company had a financial interest, was zoned for conservation or as an area of special significance by the Westernport Regional Planning Authority prior to  Mr Peter  Leake taking up his position as  chairman  of  Mr Lynch  ‘s electorate committee on 6 October 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is traditional around the Christmas period at the end of the year for Aboriginals, particularly those who are engaged in seasonal work, to return to the place where their <span class="highlight">family</span> roots have been sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement then goes on to make certain claims about the introduction of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme- certainly a worthwhile reform; certainly something which the Opposition did not oppose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we pointed out at the time of its introduction that if the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance were introduced in this way and if tax rebates for children were abolished, if justice was to be maintained, it was essential that that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance should be regularly upgraded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have produced tables, never questioned in the Parliament, which demonstrate that with the introduction of the Medibank levy and of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and with the scrapping of the children’s rebates which would have been indexed, what has happened is that anyone earning $120 to $200 a week who has more than one child has less disposable income now than he would have had under the old tax scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance recommendations of Professor Henderson were only part of a recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out on numerous occasions in recent weeks that any housewife can cut down her budget expenditure if she does not provide the necessary needs for her <span class="highlight">family</span> and her children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She can cut down her budget if she makes her <span class="highlight">family</span> go without. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will it do about their commitments on their homes, about their children’s education which will be disrupted and all the other things that go to making a happy <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister spoke about how the Government by way of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, had put a great deal more money into the hands of those who normally bear most of the day to day responsibility for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was introduced the husband in well regulated families used to budget and allocate so much out of his pay packet to the wife and mother on which she had to run the household. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what the mother is getting on the one hand by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance her husband is keeping out of her weekly housekeeping allowance in order to meet his weekly commitments because he has to put so much aside for council rates, house payments and those sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite this the Minister in her speech boasted about the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, it introduces significant improvements to the reversionary benefits arrangements of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits schemesthose benefits which are extended to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a contributing or retired member upon his or her death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 24 August 1977  (Hansard,  page 451)  Senator Grimes  asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason for abolishing tax rebates and introducing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for dependent children and students was a redirect assistance towards families most in need, namely those with insufficient taxable income, and therefore insufficient gross tax liabilities, to take full advantage of the former tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer indicated that any land transactions with which he was associated were conducted by a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust company and not by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would a grant of special benefit still leave the <span class="highlight">family</span> approximately 10 per cent below the Henderson poverty line, estimated at $240.80 per week for this <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He had a remarkably successful <span class="highlight">family</span> whose talents are unusually gifted in the extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was proud of the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and they gave him affection, as I have been a happy witness to on many occasions during their visits here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion we pass on our esteem and our condolences to the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> with a very deep sense of feeling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He loved his <span class="highlight">family</span>, he loved his garden and he loved the outdoors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, his <span class="highlight">family</span> told me that even a few days before his death he asked that he be put in a utility to be driven around the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with the Senate in expressing condolences, particularly to his <span class="highlight">family</span>- a great <span class="highlight">family</span> and one which, right down to his grandchildren, loved Teddy Mattner as we did so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the  Senator expresses  its deep regret at the death of the Honourable  Sir John  Armstrong Spicer, Q.C, a senator for Victoria from 1940 to 1944 and from 1950 to 1956, Attorney-General from 1950 to 1956, and Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court from 1956 to 1977, and that the Senate places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that his <span class="highlight">family</span> will find consolation in knowing that he had a fine life, one deserving of great credit and favour from the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore join in the expression of condolence to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honourable Allan Nicoll MacDonald, former  Senator for  Western Australia from 1935 to 1947, and Minister of the Crown from 1 937 to 1 939, and that the Senate places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe I was also asked a question with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, and I gave a general assurance that the period would be covered with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances until such time as eligibility for the unemployment benefit was attained by a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be understood in respect of student children that the Social Services Act specifically provides that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments cease from the end of the four-weekly payment period in which the full-time education ceases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure of the Department is to post a review form to parents and on the undertaking given by parents the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is either resumed or deferred until such time as the parents advise what action will be taken by the student child in the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time I made the statement in November I believed that the closure dates of schools were such that before the following payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would be received a student child over the age of 16 years would be eligible to receive the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we look at the general picture of <span class="highlight">family</span> income over the period of that vacation we see that the gain of the unemployment benefit after the 6 weeks deferment would mean that a <span class="highlight">family</span> would be in better financial circumstances than it would have been if the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance had been the only payment received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a seminar on the future of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm that was held last year in Roma by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries one of the extension officers had this to say of primary producers: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we know, most of these services are provided by what is basically known as small business, the one-<span class="highlight">family</span> outfit that has been in the community for some considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is heartbreak in a situation where a selection that has been in a <span class="highlight">family</span> for generations has to go under the hammer and a sense of failure, albeit not justified, goes with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people say that it was brought in to raise money for wartime funds; other people say that it was brought in to break up large <span class="highlight">family</span> holdings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a famous story from the 17th century about an obstetrician who invented one of the first obstetric forceps and kept it secret in his own <span class="highlight">family</span> for the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s profit and fame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only people who benefited from the use of that appliance were those who could pay to go to that practitioner or his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No charges have been made against Peter John Browne; nor have any charges been made against a woman who in 1961 was Esther Grace Stevens and is now  Mrs Crichton-Brown,  and who was granted 2,000 shares in the company at the same time; or against Norma Rosa Stevens, her mother, who was allotted 2,000 shares in the company at the same time; or Malcolm Scott Holdings Pty Ltd, the <span class="highlight">family</span> investment company of ex-Liberal Party  Senator Malcolm  Scott, which was granted 1,000 shares in the company at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All he wants is that he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> can live in the particular lifestyle they have chosen, without harassment, and secure in the knowledge that because of that lifestyle and because they have not done anything wrong they do not have to worry about being deported from Australia, where they have chosen now to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, he did get into trouble with his <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, but he does not have as much financial trouble as have many of these families in Mannum who have been existing on benefits provided under the State Unemployment Relief scheme instituted by the Dunstan Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to pursue the objectives of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and the rehabilitation of Timor, Australia will need to continue to deal directly with the Indonesian Government as the authority in effectual control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What will be the view of the unemployed in this country who are visited by inspectors to see whether they are entitled to the $36 or $49 a week that they are getting when they learn that a senior Minister’s <span class="highlight">family</span> uses tax avoidance schemes, however legal they are, to avoid contributions to the public revenue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of unemployment is the personal hardship involved; indeed the complete destruction of a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s living standards as jobs become harder to get . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is cut in half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until you can get some justice let them do it all themselves and let them pay your husband the sort of wage that will cover the needs of you and your <span class="highlight">family</span> without you being sold into slavery all your life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Stay home and let one man ‘s wage pay for all the <span class="highlight">family</span> necessities as once it did ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade unions, governments, and employers have let one man’s wage drift so far back that it will no longer keep a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> and so we have the <span class="highlight">family</span> income made up of two people’s wages, and in my opinion one of those people gets less than justice in the market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is it doing about the effects that these problems have on the health of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what will be the result of the worry caused if they are unemployed and the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is halved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What of the worry caused by the collapse of his morale and the lack of <span class="highlight">family</span> income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add that the Federal Court of Australia Act and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act each empowers the making of regulations to provide for fees payable in respect of proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia and in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and other courts exercising jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This reform will be of considerable assistance to farmers and small businesses which are run on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will enable assets to be transmitted from generation to generation without the necessity of selling part of the assets or part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm which are essential for the running of the business or the farm, as the case may be, to meet the demand of the federal estate duty assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I conclude with a few words about the role of women in society and the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a basic unit in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As reported at page 2 1 7 of the Senate  Hansard of 25  February 1976, which I shall not read, I made reference to the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a unit in society and mentioned the important role of both parents with the father being equally as important as the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 9 March last year, after the opening of the Parliament, when I was privileged to second the motion for the adoption of the AddressinReply, I used the example of the happy <span class="highlight">family</span> life of  Her  Majesty the Queen as a basis on which to re-state those sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has been called the primordial unit of society: Man, woman and their offspring- the greatest influence in all our lives, for good or evil; the source of our hereditary characteristics; and the first model on which our behaviour patterns are built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Urie Bronfenbrenner, who is regarded as a world authority on the welfare of children and who wrote a magnificent article on the <span class="highlight">family</span> entitled ‘The Origins of Alienation’, which appeared in the  Scientific American,  has said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence indicates that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the most effective and economical system for fostering and sustaining the development of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence indicates so far that the involvement of the child’s <span class="highlight">family</span> as an active participant is critical in any intervention program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without such <span class="highlight">family</span> involvement, any effects of intervention, at least in the cognitive sphere, appear to erode fairly rapidly once the program ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good economy and essential for effective social services to have families fully involved and for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to be regarded as the basic unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst one does not quarrel in any way with the statement made by the Attorney-General, one has to look at the figures for the years prior to the introduction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to gain the correct perspective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that in a happy <span class="highlight">family</span> situation- a responsible situation- the State is spared these costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trite to say that a continuing and happy <span class="highlight">family</span> with both parents accepting their responsibility for the love and care of the children of the marriage is in the long run a saving to the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act does not really protect the children of a marriage for the trauma of a breakdown in that marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting on one side the consequences to the young child of divorce legislation which protects the irresponsible partner in the marriage, when the concept of guilt is removed from consideration in the dissolution of a marriage- I am happy to concede that that has happened in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law context- all that happens really is that the concept of guilt is considered at the child-custody level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has made it very easy for a marriage to be dissolved, the custody of the children and the property settlement are still matters over which the parties argue, very often to the distress of the children of the marriage who, I think, are the major concern of all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look back some 20 or 30 years to find that the care of the young, the sick and the old were <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone would argue that the therapy received by institutionalisation is better than the human companionship of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, even the so-called bad <span class="highlight">family</span>, and the cost to the nation of institutionalisation is enormous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this weakening of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a functional social mechanism which is at the heart of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time does not permit me to go into greater detail so I will conclude on this note: Next year, 1979, is the Year of the Child and, whilst we are all gravely obsessed with the economic problems which confront the nation, in the long term the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a unit in society is vital to the future of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they wanted to listen to the radio at that time on a Sunday afternoon- obviously a fairly popular time for <span class="highlight">family</span> listening- the ABC was the only program they could listen to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the mail run and exchange go, it is likely that the local railway <span class="highlight">family</span> will be transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> also has several children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The families in the beef-raising areas of Queensland, certainly parents in this area who have a fairly young <span class="highlight">family</span>, cannot afford to send their children to boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can tell the Senate of a <span class="highlight">family</span> in Kalgoorlie which would rather suffer hardship than allow their daughter, who is 17 years of age, to go to a town 50 miles away where work is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the position of a man who lives with a teenage <span class="highlight">family</span> in a rural area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has failed to notice that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which the Australian Labor Party rejected as part of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, have made the most massive transfer of finance from the rich to the poor that has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Grant is made to assist this organisation to provide an emergency care and <span class="highlight">family</span> support service for Aboriginal children in the Brisbane metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point that I think should be made is that during the whole period his wife has been employed by the Education Department, so it is not as though the <span class="highlight">family</span> is without means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every one of us knows of the drain on our private and <span class="highlight">family</span> lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other two are <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and refugee, and these two have been expanded considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They brought a higher cost of living to the working <span class="highlight">family</span>, to the business man, to the carrier and in particular- I have noticed this in the last two years- a higher cost of living in those isolated settlements on our northern coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the various matters that have arisen within the last few weeks, I feel that whilst I would like to speak about the situation in Timor- I will speak on that at a later date- I would also like to speak on what I would term the ‘Pacific <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the program ‘The <span class="highlight">Family</span>’ that was the subject of some controversy was in fact developed and supervised by the Headmasters’ Conference of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to several questions I asked last year concerning the application for permanent residence by Timorese leader,  Mr Chris  Santos, and his <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware of the considerable hardship caused to  Mr Santos  and his <span class="highlight">family</span> by this inordinate delay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will  Mr Santos  and his <span class="highlight">family</span> be granted permanent residence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fees that have been paid to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are not paid by those who get legal aid in that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the principle we have adopted in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court area, and I should imagine it would apply generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservatives continually claim- I put  Senator Messner  in that category- that South Australia had the highest charges when putting a <span class="highlight">family</span> car on the road. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believed that he had earned the right to serve the nation quietly, at peace with himself, at peace with the nation- at peace with his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir John  Kerr, once having discharged his duty to the nation under the most difficult circumstances, has no wish to continue as the centre of public dispute, making it impossible for him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to live the normal life to which we are all entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the feelings of my wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>, who with me have had to withstand the vilification and attack for part of my term as Governor-General, and now in prospect through a term as Ambassador to UNESCO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the first of the basic facets of a free enterprise democracy may be the diginity and security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is within the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit that a great deal of the character of a nation and the basic strength of a free society are formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to encourage such conservation it would encourage Australians to increase their productivity, to increase their capacity to employ people and to increase their capacity to serve a useful purpose in the <span class="highlight">family</span> of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that, in talking about its belief that there should be a better society, the Government would have said something about the fundamental unit of society, namely, the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note with a great deal of pleasure that many honourable senators who have spoken before me and, indeed, many members of the House of Representatives have used the occasion of the Address-in-Reply debate to talk about the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is under pressure and the Government is doing very little about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married women in the work force, as some have suggested; rather, the solution lies in Government financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker, contribution to <span class="highlight">family</span> support programs and thus reverse the economic discrimination now experienced by single income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, there are thousands of young married women who want to leave the work force and start a <span class="highlight">family</span> but cannot do so because of housing finance problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this advice are policies for <span class="highlight">family</span> support coming forward? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that the Government must have a balance in the advice that it receives on <span class="highlight">family</span> matters and women ‘s issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understand correctly what I hear from my constituents they are concerned about what is happening to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice coming from these sources is destructive of the principles of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, as she realises and as I realise, there are problems for women who have performed their <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities and want to get back into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the descendant of a <span class="highlight">family</span> which was one of the pioneers in the New England district of New South Wales I have great sympathy for the plight of the rural producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was necessary for me to go to Boreen Point with Paul because I am an alcoholic and I need <span class="highlight">family</span> support and assistance with my problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had stayed in Brisbane without any <span class="highlight">family</span> support or assistance with my problem, I am sure that my alcoholic disability would have been made much worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not fit into the <span class="highlight">family</span> well because of his problem and his brother just did not want to have him in the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went so that he would have <span class="highlight">family</span> support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has overcome this problem of alcoholism provided that he has <span class="highlight">family</span> support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is able to work but he has to move to seek the support of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and because of that he is denied the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an unusual reference, because it has occurred in regard to a partisan measure, not a non-party matter such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them are <span class="highlight">family</span> companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that the plight of women who encounter this sort of difficulty in any country is made much more difficult in the Timorese people by the particular relationship between the father and the Timorese <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is in a sense a patriach, the titular head of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and is responsible for all those practical activities in respect of which he most sadly missed in the kind of situation I have described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that report ACFOA had something to say firstly about  the notion of <span class="highlight">family</span> as it applies to the Timorese community and other communities of a non- Western culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not want to touch on that in any detail, but some hardship is caused by the very strict application of the notion of <span class="highlight">family</span> in the nuclear sense as we understand it in a country such as Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many Timorese refugee families in Australia, therefore, are suffering by having rip head of <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Timor among our close relations, we find our husbands, sons, parents, brothers, and other families still suffering the anguish and horrors of a cruel war that has sown death and destruction among our people, respecting neither age, nor sex, <span class="highlight">family</span> ties, nor friendships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion aspect, the main reasons they gave for wanting to come to Australia were: better prospects for employment and resettlement; their desire to live in a climate more akin to that of Timor; and a general wish to live not very far from Timor, with a view to re-establishing contact with friends and relatives when access to the territory is eventually permitted by Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be imposing a strict definition of ‘<span class="highlight">family</span>’ or ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> relationships’ and saying that because people who do not have <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia should not be able to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that document the Council speaks of <span class="highlight">family</span> units and <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions and points out that a degree of affinity has to be permitted, but that in general there might be good reasons for limiting entry to parents and single children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless in view of the widely acknowledged and demonstrable importance of <span class="highlight">family</span> support systems in times of crisis ACFOA urges that in the case of refugees: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in later stages of resettlement and integration sympathetic consideration should be given to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion whether from the country of origin or elsewhere, even when such <span class="highlight">family</span> members are nondependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is here in Australia without the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and he wants to go back to Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> want him to stay here and be educated in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is here with an uncle and other members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> want him to stay here but the Department has rejected his application and has indicated that there is no great hope that he will be allowed to remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These obviously are cases where the sooner the husband can come out to Australia and the <span class="highlight">family</span> can be re-united the better it will be for all concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am personally aware of representations made to the Indonesian Government with regard to a visit and with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions about which we all feel so strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stressed the strong feelings of the Australian Government concerning <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also aware of our Foreign Minister’s representations and continued statements with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that following the elections in Indonesia this month an early visit can be made to overcome the difficulties that have been outlined in the Senate this evening with regard to finalising what ought to be a very compassionate reunion of <span class="highlight">family</span> members as early as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion is a foremost aim of the Government and it is one that will have our close and active attention until we are able to fulfil what we had anticipated at least a year ago as being a matter of some urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An instruction has gone out to the company that it is not to carry that man in or out of the area where his <span class="highlight">family</span> is now settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aspects of the report discuss the needs of families for assistance during the phases of <span class="highlight">family</span> development through to the point at which children leave home and the <span class="highlight">family</span> comprises adult members only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, honourable senators may be aware that we have already established, through the children’s services program which is administered by the Office of Child Care, a three-year pilot program to develop <span class="highlight">family</span> support services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrangements are in hand for States and Territories to establish welfare programs aimed at assisting parents to improve their child-rearing practices and thereby improve <span class="highlight">family</span> functioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address to the Minister for Social Security a question concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span> support services scheme about which announcements have been made recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is called a <span class="highlight">family</span> support services scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a 3-year funding program through the Office of Child Care to provide funds for voluntary community organisations which are engaged in activities of support to families such as <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling, financial counselling, advisory services, and services relating to ethnic groups, Aborigines and lone parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add that his interests extended beyond the circle of his work in the Senate and his devotion to his own <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought therefore that you,  Mr President,  would welcome the opportunity- I hope I will be supported by other honourable senators- to express on this public occasion the sadness we feel that one who was in reality a part of our Senate life has died so quickly and suddenly and to convey our sorrow and sadness to his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that other honourable senators who knew Alan and the work he did here and who enjoyed his pleasant personality would, like you,  Mr President,  to place on the record of the Senate, through the medium of this adjournment debate, our appreciation of his work and our very deep sympathy to the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who are left behind to mourn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) What progress has been made in securing the agreement of State Governments to transfer or refer power to the Commonwealth to enable the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to make necessary orders with respect to children who are not the legitimate children of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will action be effected to ensure that all children can be treated with equal justice by the Courts and that other deficiencies arising in <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law legislation through recent decisions of the High Court can be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) A reference of constitutional power to the Commonwealth to enable it to confer jurisdiction on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts over children not covered by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act necessarily depends entirely on the willingness of States to make such a reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments were made to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act following the decision of the High Court in  Russell  v.  Russell  to bring it within the limits of constitutional power as determined in that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as the action referred to in the question can only be taken if the Commonwealth acquires additional <span class="highlight">family</span> law powers, it must await the outcome of the initiatives that has been taken in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General referred to in ( 1 ) above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reports of the speech that I made in Sydney on Monday morning at the opening of the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court premises indicate that I proposed to ask the States to hand over to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court the power in relation to custody matters which has been denied to it as a result of decisions of the High Court, a situation which leads to considerable problems that have been previously canvassed and are well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government’s suggestions that the recognition would improve the future progress of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and the rehabilitation of Timor were spurious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to pursue the objectives of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and the rehabilitation of Timor, Australia will need to continue to deal directly with the Indonesian Government as the authority in effective control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of explanation of why the Government gave de facto recognition, the Minister tried to justify the Government’s action on the basis of future <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and the rehabilitation of Timor being important ingredients in a practical contribution to the peace of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have already said the quality of life of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the outback has deteriorated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Consider the position of a <span class="highlight">family</span> living on an Aboriginal settlement or a pastoral station out in the bush. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Did Justice Elizabeth Evatt hold talks in Brisbane with the six judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court bench of Queensland last Friday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that she conferred with judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Brisbane on the discussions which have been taking place about an agreement between the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth concering the establishment of a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Queensland Government reject an invitation to establish a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was first passed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When did the Queensland Government change its mind and make known its interest in a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the current state of negotiations between the Queensland and Commonwealth governments regarding the establishment of a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate is awarethis really arises out of the matter on which  Senator Colston  asked me a question yesterday- the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act contains a provision which enables an agreement to be reached between any State government and the Commonwealth Government to establish State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts on terms set out therein, and to exercise jurisdiction thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is well known, the Western Australian Government decided that it would enter into negotiations, and subsequently arrived at an agreement for the establishment of a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Attorney-General for Queensland,  Mr Knox,  informed the Commonwealth that the Queensland Government had considered the matter and had decided against the establishment of a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court, adding as a rider that this was its position for the time being at least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In January 1976, after the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court was set up, the present Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of all States including, of course, Queensland and invited them to consider the establishment of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 21 January 1976  Mr Knox,  who was still AttorneyGeneral for Queensland, notified my predecessor that his Government had decided not to create a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March 1977 the present Queensland Attorney-General,  Mr Lickiss,  publicly announced that he favoured the establishment of a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court but that there had been no government decision in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that the question of now establishing a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in Queensland, after the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia has been functioning very satisfactorily in Queensland for more than two years, does present some major difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should emphasise, however, that if a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court were established in Queensland it would be exercising jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and, as happens in Western Australia, would be administering the <span class="highlight">family</span> law as it applies throughout Australia generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State <span class="highlight">family</span> court of Queensland would have that obligation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, as in Western Australia, appeal could be made from the State <span class="highlight">family</span> court to the full court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as I was told during my brief visit with you to Kowanyama that there are many cattle outstations from Kowanyama, the proposal is that <span class="highlight">family</span> groups will manage cattle on their traditional land under an overall integrated management scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One advantage that can be seen by some of these families of living out on their own land is that inter-<span class="highlight">family</span> tensions at Aurukun seem to be much reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not many people live there; one <span class="highlight">family</span> and two or three old people live in three dwellings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The community is the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is on its home land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in any well organised <span class="highlight">family</span> there are always differences of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The men were given jobs and the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> or clan was tuckered by the properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are therefore grateful to  Senator Martin  for bringing before this House documented evidence that  Mr Killoran  had known about this since 1975, had had frequent correspondence with the Uniting Church about it since 1975, had frequently expressed his disapproval of such action and at one stage had declared, quite wrongly as was shown later, that the outstation movement and the development of clan and <span class="highlight">family</span> groups away from the settlement was illegal because it was against the policy of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they have lost income because of illness or injury, and if the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is below certain limits, sickness benefit is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a report in the Melbourne  Sun  on 10 April of the weekend meeting between Commonwealth and State AttorneysGeneral and in particular to the statement that all State governments except those of Queensland and Western Australia are prepared to transfer <span class="highlight">family</span> law powers to the Commonwealth to enable the same laws and facilities to apply to the custody and welfare of ex-nuptial children and to all matrimonial property in order to overcome the effects of High Court judgments in 1976 which limited the effectiveness of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meeting considered the form of a Bill to refer certain <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that it is estimated that emission controls on motor vehicles cost $150 per normal <span class="highlight">family</span> car and can cost as much as $500 on some cars and that fuel consumption is increased- with about 9 per cent drop in miles per gallon- and also that fuel costs increase by some 7 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is there any substance in the statement reported in today’s  Age  newspaper, that many marriages unnecessarily end in divorce because the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court does not refer these couples to marriage guidance counsellors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which established the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court, has established the position of counsellors attached to the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a major advance in the administration of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, as the court itself does not have to proceed on purely legal grounds but has the facility of expert guidance from people skilled in marriage counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sought advice through the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  and we feel that there is a need for some provision in this legislation to ensure that the interests of individuals in these cases are protected, because as far as we are able to ascertain they are not fully protected under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the Superannuation Act if there is a situation in which under other laws such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act a person is left in a clearly disadvantaged position despite the fact that he or she may have contributed, even indirectly, over many years to the benefits which that spouse assumes would be available- if necessary on the ground of relative needs, as is the existing case for a legal spouse and de facto spouse- there should be some similar provision for a former spouse, a divorced person, and the legal spouse at the time of death or subsequent to the death of the contributor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any honourable senator or any married person would quibble that, where there is one income in the <span class="highlight">family</span> and a contribution is made to a superannuation fund, the wife certainly helps contribute to that fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She goes without, perhaps in a personal and a <span class="highlight">family</span> way, along with her husband in making that contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this anomaly is not dealt with fully in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and could be considered under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> law situation is such that she can go off and get a divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they do not say: May it please your Honour ‘in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make about that original assessment of $120 a week is that the judge is commanded by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, in fixing alimony, to take into account any superannuation rights either accrued or accruing to either spouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now  Senator Walters  says that although the judge has taken that situation into account as commanded by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, under this Bill we should make it possible for the wife to get the full superannuation payment if her husband dies tomorrow or in eight years’ time, despite the blithe and easy divorce of which she has taken the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are just at the beginning in relation to the working out of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, not just in relation to the terms of an appropriate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, but also in relation to its effects and implications in other areas of law and administration, such as social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court has no power to deal with payments to be made under the Superannuation Act after the  death of the particular contributor concerned; such payments are solely governed by the provisions of the Superannuation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfair treatment by Superannuation Act 1976 (Cth) of wives of contributors divorced under <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 (Cth) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an address delivered at Melbourne on 17 May 1977 on the occasion of opening new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court premises there, the then Commonwealth Attorney-General  (Mr R. J. Ellicott, Q.C.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>made reference to the impact upon society of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 (Cth) as follows: ‘We are just at the beginning in relation to the working out of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, not just in relation to the terms of an appropriate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, but also in relation to its effects and implications in other areas of law and administration, such as social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most serious repercussions of the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has been the creation of a new disadvantaged minority, namely divorced wives, and more particularly those divorcees who unfortunately happen to be the ex-wives of deceased contributors under the Superannuation Act 1976 (Cth), which constitutes the new superannuation scheme affecting the hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth public servants in Australia, and which will also be a pace-setter for other superannuation schemes, both new and revised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the root of the matter lies the concept of no-fault divorce reflected in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, more especially in s. 48. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That either party to a marriage, thus subject of an irretrievable breakdown, can proceed to a divorce in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia by a relatively painless path, and, depending on the venue, within days untie the marital knot by a tenminute hearing before a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge has been a matter of comment not only in the local press, but in overseas newspapers (see, for example, article bearing the title, ‘NoFault Divorce Law in Australia’, in the  New York Times,  7 May 1977). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this possibility of obtaining relatively speedy no-fault divorces under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1 975 that nas created the problem affecting superannuation rights of divorced wives as dependants under the Superannuation Act 1976 ( C,h). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On her ex-husband ‘s death, the surviving divorced wife, who may have lived with him for a period between twenty and thirty years, while he was contributing and building up superannuation entitlements, will be entitled to nothing under the Superannuation Act, while the second wife, who may have lived with the deceased for only one year or two years, will as his surviving legal wife receive the whole of what would otherwise have gone to the divorced wife had a divorce under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act not been obtained by the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court has no power to deal with payments to be made under the Superannuation Act after the death of the particular contributor concerned; such payments are solely governed by the provisions of the Superannuation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the absence of provision for a divorced wife in the Superannuation Act is inconsistent with the approach of the legislature in s. 79 (4) (B) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, under which, in proceedings relating to the property of parties to divorce proceedings, such as the matrimonial home, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court is enjoined to take cognisance of the contribution made directly or indirectly to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of the property by either party, including any contribution made in the capacity of home maker or parent; a wife who has lived for many years with a contributor under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme may be said to have contributed as a homemaker to the building up of her husband ‘s entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also paradoxical that the legislature, which has purported to make provision for a no-fault, no-guilt divorce in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975, should by the absence of the necessary provision for a divorced wife in the Superannuation Act 1976 virtually penalise her as though she were the guilty party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply ask that it be given serious consideration in view of what seems to be a limitation in the application of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and what is acknowledged to be a limitation in the Superannuation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general community looks to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to provide the basis for the financial support of divorced parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be difficult to refute as the Commonwealth has determined community standards through its <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be a reflection on the community, on the <span class="highlight">family</span> and on the schools that such a stream of people has come through the system without achieving the necessary minimum skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that one of the most important issues as far as the people of Australia are concerned was the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first very interesting Bills which was introduced in the Senate after my election in May 1974 was the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hark back to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and I remind  Senator Gietzelt  that the Bill which was introduced in 1974 was the third version which was introduced into the Senate by the then Attorney-General,  Senator Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This survey excluded women who had alcoholic or sick husbands not earning an income and so had to be the bread winners in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The trade union movement in this country has done precious little about the fact that it now takes two people’s wages to keep a <span class="highlight">family</span> and the days when one man’s wages were sufficient to keep a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> and women did not have to work have gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has he done to make sure that counselling on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and information on how to cope with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities is available? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take exception to an accusation that I have done nothing within the trade union movement to support a wage that is capable of sustaining a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop  and others in this chamber also supported for many years the view that there should be a wage sufficient to provide for the needs of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I almost sought advice from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court because there seemed to be a wide spread of claims in respect to the parenthood of the legislation in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the proposed legislation relating to the so-called Curran scheme come within the usual objections to retrospective legislation where taxpayers have arranged their <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs and incurred substantial expenditure on the basis of long-standing laws and fully accepted tax principles? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that this controversial section is a very small percentage of the total <span class="highlight">family</span> area, but I do consider it an important one that needs to be treated very sensitively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In order that there should be an understanding of this matter, let me first say this: The part of SEMP that deals with the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the one that would contain the section on alternative life styles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it be looked at as a whole and if the <span class="highlight">family</span> section of SEMP is looked at as a whole, it will be found to be balanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span>, the St Vincent de Paul Society and other groups have had to render assistance to people who are suffering hardship and to destitute families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that anybody could reasonably say he would want his <span class="highlight">family</span> travelling on the same aircraft as a Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is concern about the effect that that will have in frustrating the objectives of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a patient is in a nursing home which charges a fee above the statutory fee upon which we have based our support, there is a gap, and it needs to be met either by the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the patient or by arrangements with the nursing home concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gap would need to be covered by the next of kin or <span class="highlight">family</span> or by special arrangements because the government subsidy is at the level I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By this time I believe that this man was in fairly desperate straits trying to keep his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To Lady Henty and the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the late  Sir Denham  we extend our deepest sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 9 May 1978 of the Honourable  Sir Norman  Henry Denham Henty K B E., a senator for the State of Tasmania from 1 July 1950 until 30 June 1968, a Minister of the Crown from 1 956 to 1 968 and a former Leader of the Government in the Senate, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that neither he nor his <span class="highlight">family</span> would mind my recalling the fact that in Launceston there is a very fine airport terminal for which the people of Launceston can thank, I think in a very large degree, the efforts of Denham Henty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy which have been made to Lady Henty and the <span class="highlight">family</span> on this rather sad occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that the years he had in retirement were a great comfort to his wife, Lady Faith, and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to be associated with this condolence motion and offer my very deepest sympathy to  Sir Denham  ‘s widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in the great loss that they have sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure all honourable senators will join me in extending to the Government and people of Italy, and to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the late Aldo Moro, our profound sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, relates to regulation 162 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 which makes it necessary for members of Parliament, as it does for members of the public, to obtain leave of a judge or magistrate or the Registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court before transcripts of evidence and information that may be helpful to them in determining an inquiry made on behalf of a constituent can be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the problem mentioned by  Senator Coleman  is the fundamental difference between the procedure of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and procedures of other courts of Australia in that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is not open to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a very firm policy decision of this Parliament when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was passed after a lengthy debate here and in another place in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware also of a good deal of opposition to it, but I do not want to express a personal view in relation to the matter, particularly as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act may well be reviewed by a parliamentary committee in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting to note that during the whole of the time that we spent in that area he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> were the only Aboriginal persons we saw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The company can even determine, as happens in some company towns in Western Australia, whether the members of a person’s immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> can visit that person and, if they do visit, how long they will stay and at exactly what point of time they will leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that a large section of the community will be delighted to see the end of this impost, which for a long time has been causing serious problems in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> arrangements, particularly on the death of a member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> conducting a small business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Requirements for the lodgment of estate duty returns are to be changed to reflect the ultimate abolition of estate duty and the interim <span class="highlight">family</span> exemption proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To those who served him he was always courteous and considerate and to his <span class="highlight">family</span> he was a constant symbol of devotion and love. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will be remembered as a leader, a statesman, a scholar, an ally, a friend and, to his <span class="highlight">family</span>, as a loving and devoted husband, brother and father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fellows such as  Senator Sir Robert  Cotton, who is in the chamber, will dearly remember that  Sir Robert  Menzies talked about how he detested the petty bureaucracy which bedevilled the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span>; how much he felt that government ought to be designed to free the ordinary person and to help him to fulfil himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thank God on this occasion that he gave those talents to the service  of  his country, much to our admiration and the admiration and affection  of  his <span class="highlight">family</span>, whose service to him, especially during the last few years  of  his affliction, is something that we will always remember with the deepest affection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Health, refers to the changes to Medibank and, in particular, to a Press report this morning which indicated that the Minister for Health had told a Press conference that the changes to the health insurance scheme should bring about a reduction in <span class="highlight">family</span> health insurance contribution rates of about 46c a week and that the health funds would be made to pass on those savings to contributors, if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to point out that the former Government’s policy of providing 75 per cent cost of salaries of agreed staff in pre-schools, provided they confirm that they extend and integrate their activities to cover other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> need, will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It certainly has been the case in past years where a surviving spouse has often been placed in a very difficult situation through the imposition of death duties on the value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the decease of the principal of the business the surviving members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> sometimes in the past have been placed in a crippling position as a result of the imposition of death duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What in fact we are talking about under these four Bills- this is why it is appropriate for them to be linked together- is the imposition of some form of tax on the passing on of an estate from a deceased person to those closely related members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who are dealt with in the Bills which are before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the view of the Australian Labor Party- I would have thought that this is a view which is held not only by socialists but by a number of people who believe in the equality of opportunity and in a more egalitarian society- that there should not be an unrestricted flow of capital from one member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> to another member of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, this legislation provides that the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a man who might happen to fly over Western Australia in an aeroplane, see a lump of iron ore and as a consequence amass a multi-million dollar fortune- one could make some comments about the personal effort involved in acquiring that sort of fortune- could on that man’s death become beneficiaries of that fortune without any portion of it coming to the Commonwealth of Australia in the form of estate or death duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the earlier damaging references about inheritance being some form of evil I ask whether the Senate considers inheritance to be relevant to the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is still the basic unit of this free society and we tend to guard it in that capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that inheritance, the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and the abolition of death duties are virtually one and the same concept; that one is significant and definitely referable to the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the lifetime of this Government it has introduced tax reform in clear areas- the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances system; the full indexation of income taxation, which was righting one of the rip-offs of the Whitlam era; the tax cuts of February 1977; and the total indexation of pensions to the full consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such is the nature of the individual in this society, who seeks to protect beyond his death the assets that he has accumulated, having made no provision in his own time for the protection, education and support of members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who have had to survive themselves by their own efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So much for the protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span>,  Senator Scott. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt that  Mr Iwasaki  would like those assets to flow, without any limitation whatsoever, to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of one <span class="highlight">family</span> of three sons who worked on a dairy farm with their mother and father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know of another <span class="highlight">family</span> where, when the husband was alive, he and his wife farmed their property very effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event at least she is being generous to that extent, but what about the children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to cut the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, about which it has boasted so much over the past two and a half years, or does it intend to cheat the unemployed again, as it did in the previous Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About six months ago there was a good deal of publicity about <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts which were established by senior Ministers of the Government for the explicit purpose of evading tax on incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do your private <span class="highlight">family</span> companies, <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts have the effect of lowering the rate of tax that you pay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> trusts are designed to help keep the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s assets together, yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, contrary to  Senator Scott’s  naive assertion, income largely escapes taxation if one does as most of the senior Ministers of this Government seem to do and establishes a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust for the explicit purpose of evading tax on income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, last November, the  Deputy  Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  was also challenged publicly on his <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because you have a <span class="highlight">family</span> operation, because you want to keep it in the <span class="highlight">family</span> name, because you do not want to be forced to liquidate your property when you pass on and not enable your children to take it, then you try to make other arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what he is claiming, if one studies the answer very carefully, is that his <span class="highlight">family</span> trust was established not for the purpose of evading tax on income, but for evading probate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is true, now that this Government is proceeding to abolish probate duty, I assume that we can expect the rapid dissolution of the Anthony <span class="highlight">family</span> trust if, in fact,  Mr Anthony  was telling the truth at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no coal interests, or my <span class="highlight">family</span> have no coal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  ‘s tortured English, it is perfectly clear that he unequivocally denied that he or his <span class="highlight">family</span> had any interest in coal mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well the whole situation in relation to what one might hold, or my <span class="highlight">family</span> might hold, has got nothing to do with the whole subject that you may wish to debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it came through very clearly that  Mr BjelkePetersen  issued an unequivocal denial that he or his <span class="highlight">family</span> had interests in companies supplying coal to the Government of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been made of the effect of inheritance taxes on <span class="highlight">family</span> farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is held to be a sacred principle or an inviolable principle that farming properties should pass from generation to generation within the one <span class="highlight">family</span>- I do not necessarily hold that view- the abolition of inheritance tax does not go nearly far enough to ensure that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those situations where inheritance taxes impose a liquidity squeeze on a <span class="highlight">family</span> farm or, I suppose, on many <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses, I think that significant improvements can be made to the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate, in order that we will know the substance of the vote taken at the second reading stage, that the first change that is made by the Bills relating to estate duty is that estate duty will not be payable by the estate of a person who died on or after 2 1 November 1977- that was part of the election policy promise- in respect of” a <span class="highlight">family</span> property that is passing to the surviving spouse, a child, a grandchild, a parent or a grandparent of the deceased person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, as from 2 1 November 1977, abolition of duty within a <span class="highlight">family</span> will apply and after 1 July 1979 abolition of probate or death duty in general terms will apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one wish that the heads of the ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> want is the chance to build a home; to get to own the home over a lifetime; to put some furniture and possessions together and to get a car- the Labor Party obviously does not want this- and then upon their death to be able to set up their children with a few thousand dollars here and there to help them along and to be a little better off than they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this is an innovation and, in defence of it, it should be said that there is a tendency now for younger people to enter parliamentary life and because they are younger they have younger families and more direct <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities than do older members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happens when a <span class="highlight">family</span> company is formed or a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust is created? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have suggested to them previously that they ought to look at the possibility of allowing families to be taxed on the basis of a <span class="highlight">family</span> partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Government prepare a detailed scheme for an elective <span class="highlight">family</span> unit system for public examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he argued that if the result was an aggregation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, that would not be acceptable because the tax would be too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Government and its advisers that the Government ought to be looking at some such <span class="highlight">family</span> unit scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, if the Government allowed families to average their income the nonsense about the creation of <span class="highlight">family</span> partnerships, <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and <span class="highlight">family</span> companies, which all are designed to spread income among husband, wife and children, would no longer continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the sitting was suspended I had asked that the Government and its advisers consider the possibility of providing for a scheme along the lines suggested by the Asprey committee- an elective <span class="highlight">family</span> unit system of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ideas that one can put forward about such a system, but the one that appeals to me is that of a <span class="highlight">family</span> partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a Liberal thinking about liberal philosophies, I believe that one of the things we should encourage is marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to introduce some kind of <span class="highlight">family</span> partnership taxation system, one could imagine a situation where a couple, when they married, would have the total of their incomes averaged and would pay the average income tax rate on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that if a wife wished to stay at home and mind her children, the <span class="highlight">family</span> would not be financially disadvantaged by her so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would go further: I believe that when a couple have their first child the <span class="highlight">family</span> should be taxed differently again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there would be three people in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, its gross income should be divided by three and each should be required to pay tax on one-third of that income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of its adoption would be to minimise greatly the prevalence of taxation schemes, all of which are directed to apportioning the gross income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> among as many members of it as is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be the answer: It would simply be a matter of devising a rate scale which would be appropriate to the change in circumstances as a result of bringing in the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, instead of the individual, as the taxation unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to  Senator Missen,  I think it is extremely naive to expect a government led by senior ministers who have publicly proclaimed the existence of their own <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, explicitly designed to avoid tax, to be motivated by any consideration of morality or equity when introducing this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A question was asked of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  on 9 May in the House of Representatives by my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  in which among other things he asked whether the Treasurer recalled the Prime Minister’s statement of 23 November and whether the Treasurer had included amongst his recently announced proposals amendments to prohibit this practice, that is, avoiding tax through <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came to the point here-  the Government has under consideration tax avoidance measures dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as a broad category, the answer is no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the  AM  program on 23 November 1 977, after there had been a good deal of publicity of the fact that the former Treasurer and the present Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party had set up <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts for investment purposes for the explicit purpose of minimising tax payable, just like the people who operated the Curran racket- the purpose is the same- the Prime Minister was asked a question and he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is entirely appropriate for people to have <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, we were to impose a higher effective rate of tax on trust income or even the same effective rate of tax as is applied to income received by individuals I expect that there would not be too many <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts left, and I do not expect that you,  Senator, would  expect too many either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be so in large capital enterprises, carried on by companies such as Amatil, or large families that have amassed fortunes, millions; but the idea of creating <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, for whom trustees carry on the business and profits flow to the beneficiaries, has gone into the metropolis and has corroded and corrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An approach has been made by a Brisbane community group to the Department of Social Security suggesting the publication of a booklet to be entitled  Preparing for a Death in the <span class="highlight">Family</span>  but the Depanment has at this stage made no commitment to such a publication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-66-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and seeks clarification of the changes to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme whereby children’s incomes are indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these changes mean that if the son of a widow earns $10 to $15 a week selling newspapers to supplement his mother’s income her <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will be reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these changes mean that if the daughter of a lowincome <span class="highlight">family</span> works in the local McDonald’s hamburger shop and earns $20 a week, again the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will be reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will children such as those who now do not have to put in tax returns have to put in income statements or similar statements so that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances can be adjusted in their cases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GUILFOYLE A change to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system was announced in the Budget Speech last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An income test is to be applied to a child to determine the eligibility of parents to a payment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions that were announced last night state that if a child is in receipt of income above a certain level there will be a withdrawal of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures given in the instances referred to by  Senator Grimes  show that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would be withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When introduced, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme took into account the tax rebates which were given for dependent children in addition to the then child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recognised by honourable senators that the separate net income can arise from splitting a <span class="highlight">family</span> income, from trust accounts, from partnership arrangements and from various other sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security whose answer to the Opposition spokesman on social security matters,  Senator Grimes,  did not explain in any way the statement at page 86 of the Budget Papers that the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance income test would save $90m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this proposed new scheme mean that every child who earns over $6 a week will thereby prevent his or her mother from receiving the full amount of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to which she is entitled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that income of such a nature earned by a child would reduce or eliminate the amount of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance that would be paid to the families involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement last night by the Treasurer was clear, I believe, to all who read it, and stated that in future <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will be income tested on the basis of a child’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned to  Senator Grimes  in response to his question that later this year a form will be sent out from the Department to every recipient of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later this year the Department will send a form to every recipient of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance explaining the effect of the change and requesting details of the income earned by each child during the 12 months ended 30 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuing entitlement to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will be assessed when the forms are returned to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine referred to the fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance that is paid to the parents of children who are earning pocket money would be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Government is concerned, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme did relate to the child rebate scheme- that is, the tax rebate at the time it was introduced- and the previous child endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year almost $ 1,000m will be spent on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say only that I am sure that the effect of the Budget in its entirety and the effect of the almost $ 1,000m that will be paid in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances next year will show that this Government has been very responsive to the needs of Australian children and the strengthening of the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed change to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme will have the effect that children who are in receipt of a separate net income of over $312 will have a reduced <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance paid on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can give no explanation other than that at present over $ 1,000m is paid in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and in the forthcoming year under $ 1,000m will be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier’s son, who has gained distinction for showing no inclination ever to serve with the civilian organisation Volunteers Abroad, is the third generation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to have carefully avoided becoming involved in war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The example that was bandied about between Senators Durack and Georges was no doubt the securities and exchange report, but another example is provided by the <span class="highlight">family</span> law report, which took years to complete and required follow-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never described figures as rubbery, but perhaps I could say that  Senator Wriedt  did not bounce very well on his predictions with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, concerns the means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the introduction of a means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances aimed principally at wealthy children who receive an unearned income through inherited property or through devices such as income splitting by trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the cost to revenue of exempting from the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance means test any income earned by the personal endeavour of the dependent child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced the means test on children’s income after reflecting on the fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme replaced the tax rebate which had previously been given to parents for a dependent child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much longer will  Mr Ruberto  and his <span class="highlight">family</span> have to wait for a decision in this not excessively complex matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has now been in operation for more than 2!6 years, having commenced on 5 January 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was passed after a very lengthy debate in both Houses of Parliament during late 1 974 and the first half of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before that, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill had been examined by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs as part of its examination of the reference on the then existing divorce law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act introduced major changes in the principles governing the laws not only of divorce but also of maintenance, matrimonial property settlements and custody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, it also established the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia as a specialist court to administer the law, and provided the opportunity for <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States to establish State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rough edges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, it could be said, were ironed out in the two amending Acts passed in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned a few moments ago, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act marked a conscious change of basic principle in a number of areas of matrimonial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I think it is fair to say that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act aroused wide expectation that the conduct of parties would not be examinable in proceedings under it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, I think it is equally fair to say that sceptics of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act were confidently predicting that the provisions for counselling, unless at least given the force of compulsion, would prove largely ineffective in preventing bitter disputes or increased <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdowns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the features of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts that few deny is the tremendous help counselling has been in the settling of proceedings which might otherwise have become protracted contested cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the success of counselling has exceeded the expectations of even the stronger supporters of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act have not operated as expected might not, in itself, be sufficient reason for submitting the operation ofthe Act to a parliamentary committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable senators may be wondering whether the establishment of the committee is necessary when the Act already provides for a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council with the stated function of monitoring the operation of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that the committee, when established, would find it helpful to consult the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council, particularly in relation to recommendations it has already made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to conclude by paying tribute to the tremendous efforts of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia since their establishment, in coping with the work of administering the large volume of applications filed under the Act, particularly in its early stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already mentioned the success of counselling under the Act, and this must be attributable, in the case of counselling in the course of proceedings, to the commendable efforts of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court counsellors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel confident that the Committee will not fail to be impressed by the dedication and professionalism shown by the people that make up the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, when before the Senate, was the subject of a non-party debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the provisions, and the operation, of the  <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Aci  1975, with particular regard to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the organisation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and its conduct of proceedings; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be more open to the public when hearing proceedings, and whether publication of the details of proceedings under the Act should be permitted; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the counsellors attached to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- I indicate briefly that the Opposition supports the establishment of this joint select committee to review the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who  were associated with the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs at the time it dealt with the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation when it was before the Senate will recall that many of the issues which now re-emerge in the terms of reference of the select committee were gone over fairly thoroughly by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a matter of regret that because the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation was not voted on along party lines in the Senate the Government did not see fit to consult with the Opposition regarding the terms of reference of this joint select committee which, as I said, canvasses much the same grounds as the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee canvassed in 1974 and 1975 and indeed members of this Senate canvassed in the debate that took place when the legislation was considered on totally non-party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act as it was adopted in 1975 was basically dealt with in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make one other comment: That relates to the constitutional difficulties which have occurred since the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill became law, particularly those which have occurred in relation to custody and maintenance matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were problems in the administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act relating to custody and maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Attorney-General that the functions of this committee of inquiry need not in any way derogate from the functions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had been a Committee stage I would have liked to hear from the Attorney-General how he thinks the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council is operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that it would not be necessary for the select committee to impinge on the proper functions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that it is impossible to obtain a cancellation of Yugoslav citizenship is well-illustrated by correspondence in Attachment (C) by Martin and Barker, Solicitors, who have been trying, since September 1 976, to find a way of cancelling citizenship for a <span class="highlight">family</span> living in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Marko Nazor, 3 1 , of Downer, who returned to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia this month after three years in a Yugoslav jail, said yesterday that he had been subjected to psychological torture and threatened with the death of his wife and three children while a political prisoner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) To which part of the Social Services Act 1947 was the Minister referring when she said (Senate  Hansard, 22  February 1978, page 20) that ‘the Social Services Act specifically provides that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments cease from the end ofthe four-weekly payment period in which the full-time education ceases’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) Section 103 (1) ofthe Social Services Act 1947 specifies the circumstances where <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance ceases to be payable in respect of a child or student child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the concern that is expressed in the community with regard to the means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to take account of the basis of a child’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again, as I said last week, that, in taking this decision, the Government had in mind circumstances where, as a result of trusts and other income-splitting devices, children receive separate income whilst their parents continue to receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that such a distinction would ensure an equitable result in the application of the Budget announcement relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these devices arc used the Government believes that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should not be paid and that a means test should be applied to such an income received by children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, follows an answer she gave earlier during Question Time to the effect that there was a good deal of confusion about the Budget proposals for income testing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and that a review of the legislation in relation to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was being undertaken to ensure the elimination of any unintended consequences of the Budget proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it intended by the Government, when it introduced the Budget, that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister now give an unqualified assurance to the people of Australia that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will not be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister cannot now give that assurance to the people of Australia, can she provide a break-up of the $90m referred to at page 86 of the Budget Papers as being a saving due to the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the second part of  Senator Harradine  ‘s question in which he mentioned the $90m that was referred to in the Budget Papers, of that figure I think some $37m was the estimate of the saving that would be made as a result of the means testing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 may be imprecise, but something like $37m or $38m relates to the means testing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and arises out of replies that she has given in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Senate correct in drawing the conclusion that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance proposals contained in the 1978 Budget were badly conceived and that arising from the public outcry the Government has changed its mind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to questions today about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances I have indicated that the Government was concerned at the reaction in the community with regard to this decision and that it has reviewed the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally in the mind of the Government was the fact that <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts are set up and income splitting occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believed that where a child could not be regarded as a dependent child the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would be means tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I adverted to the fact that when the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was set up the original tax rebates for dependent children were used as part of the source from which funds were able to be drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are any number of schemes for youth, the middle aged and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me this Bill represents a real threat to a great number of people who have chanced their arm and have had the guts to risk their capital, their <span class="highlight">family</span> and income to make Australia better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we are totally opposed to any reduction to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowance now being paid to parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will request the Government to maintain the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowance in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When did the Minister for Social Security first realise that the tax to be imposed on a child’s income in excess of $312, which was announced in the Budget last week, would affect families other than those whose children’s incomes are derived from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, partnerships, et cetera? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already there are signs of a modest increase in the money provided for housing from the savings banks and a significant increase in the outflow of money through trading banks revealing a basic movement towards the restoration of the capacity of the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> to purchase a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will restore, and we are on the way to restoring, the capacity of the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> on the average weekly wage to own a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rising unemployment- especially in the areas in which women work- and so many women being out of jobs, mean that the <span class="highlight">family</span> income has been cut in half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are worse off are the weak and the unorganised, the poor, the retired, the small businessman and the farmer, the school leaver and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has claimed that the Liberal Party is concerned with the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, but the actions of this Budget are contrary to that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frequently he uses the analogy of the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget and talks about balancing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> budget is rarely balanced because of massive commitments, and for most people the Fraser analogy is quite meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it quite clear that it would not include normal <span class="highlight">family</span> possessions such as the home, motor car, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would act positively against the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as devices for tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would remove the means test on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, a measure which was in line with our pre-Budget predictions that the Government proposed to tamper with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looks at the question of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and thinks that somehow it is an outrageous rip-off on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not appreciate that it is merely a vehicle to achieve some sort of equity in the taxation system and that in fact many people organise their affairs in that way in order to protect their <span class="highlight">family</span> interests in the long run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a vital element in preserving the free enterprise economy by virtue of businesses being able to preserve capital within the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that  Senator Wriedt  was saying that a Labor Government would wipe out the means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about this is that the Government has said already that the means test in respect of children’s income for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance purposes will not apply to children ‘s income by virtue of the moneys that they earn from newspaper selling and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very thrust of this son of legislation that will be included in the Budget is to stop any abuses in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a total inconsistency on the part of the Opposition in terms of its approach to the problem of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact here the Opposition is adopting a double standard by trying to let off the hook the person who is abusing the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that these figures relate to the period before the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation came into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countless others who would work if they could, particularly to supplement the declining real income of the main <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinner, have simply been forced to give up the task as hopeless and to join the ranks of the hidden unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the worker delved more deeply into the Budget, certainly until a couple of days ago, he would have thought that his wife’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance could have been reduced because some of his children earn money through part time work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over recent days, statements have been made here in the Senate by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and statements have been made in the House of Representatives that some changes will be made in the means test for children’s earnings in relation to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that maternity allowances have been superseded by health care and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangements and has therefore decided to abolish this benefit for births occurring after 3 1 October 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how anyone expects to be able to obtain from the health care arrangements that we have all the items that are needed after a birth in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangements that we had were to provide for something far different from the actual birth because we had maternity allowances for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He sees greater prospects of unemployment making life difficult for him as the breadwinner of a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and for his children too as they approach the time to leave school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that it is often par for the course for a person who leaves his <span class="highlight">family</span> overseas to disown them and to disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is prepared to come clean about the existence of his wife and children, I think that his <span class="highlight">family</span> should be admitted to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am-led to understand by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that  Mr Moussa  ‘s application for the entry of his <span class="highlight">family</span> has been refused because of the deception he practised in gaining entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information I have from the Minister quotes the history of the applications that were made by  Mr Moussa  for entry, and declarations he made with regard to his single status and his subsequent application with regard to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of her answers to questions asked earlier this week, can the Minister give an estimate of the number of mothers who will not receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance next year because of their children ‘s separate incomes from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and partnership arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not able to give any figures on the means testing of the separate income of children from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts or from income splitting devices that may have been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister announced a change to the means test on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer will the pocket moneys of newsboys- the income they earn from selling papers- affect the amount of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance received by their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We turn to yet another Budget miscalculation- the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance means test which has since been abolished or considerably watered down and which was to yield $90m, as I said previously, for the six months period from 1 January 1979 to 30 June 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 as resulting from the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I point out to the Senate that this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives before the announcement by the Government of its review of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangements and its statement that to test eligibility for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances on the basis of income derived from the personal exertion of children would be an unintended consequence of the Budget proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the words ‘unintended consequence’ mean that there is to be an adjustment of the results in the outlays for social security payments and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments, there seems to be no amendment at all to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 it is stated that a number of changes will be made to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can subtract the TEAS adjustment of $2 1.7m which I have just mentioned as representing what the students will lose under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme and what they will be compensated for through the increased TEAS and other payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the last financial year $ 1,038m was spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say a minimum because the average calculations are based only on those who would have been excluded totally from receiving the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances because they had an income of over $20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married women in the work force, as some have suggested but rather by implementing the Government’s financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker and contribute to <span class="highlight">family</span> support programs, thus reversing the economic discrimination now experienced by single income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, thousands upon thousands of young married women want to leave the work force and start a <span class="highlight">family</span>, but they cannot do so because of housing finance problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate is of the opinion that the Australian Government’s involvement in the 1979 International Year of the Child should pursue, as a major theme for action, the position of the child in the context of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  is aware of the interest of many members of the Parliament, indeed I assume all members of the Parliament, in the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A meeting of Ministers responsible for <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs or their representatives from 1 9 European states was held in Bonn from 7 to 9 September 1977 to discuss ways of promoting the educational role of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discussions concentrated on the particular situation of today’s <span class="highlight">family</span>, the need to stimulate the educational abilities of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and the concept of <span class="highlight">family</span>-related counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The European Ministers hope that this event will stimulate a better understanding of the positions of the child in the social and <span class="highlight">family</span> context in every country of the world, taking into account the conditions, needs and priorities of each country, and that it will make it possible to develop measures designed to foster the physical, mental and social well-being of all children, and in particular those of the third world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers refuted criticism that had been directed towards the <span class="highlight">family</span> and particularly towards the education of children within the <span class="highlight">family</span> context, and I agreed with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators know as well as I do that there is no institution within society which is more capable or better equipped than the <span class="highlight">family</span> to provide educational or a social welfare and health delivery system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the rapid social changes of recent years have led to questioning the previously undisputed acceptance of existing institutions, there is no doubt that, even today, the <span class="highlight">family</span> should be considered the basic element of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties it must face in today’s society have undoubtedly become more serious, and they still increase in number when the image of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, on the one hand, and the social concepts of life in society, on the other, become divergent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no country, the Ministers found, is there doubt as to the viability and irreplaceable role of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even today’s nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> assumes tasks which cannot be assumed by other social groups- or, if so, only partially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, stresses within the <span class="highlight">family</span> due, for instance, to the change from hierarchical <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships to relationships based on equality of spouses and a greater autonomy of children, or problems in relations between parents and educational institution, or specific educational problems, such as sex education, may be found in all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Conference acknowledged that State and society have a duty to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> in fulfilling its manifold tasks: however, they believed that, in principle, the State should not challenge the basic rights of parents to educate their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers gave priority to parents’ education and <span class="highlight">family</span>-related counselling services- particularly parents’ education because they believed that preventive measures should be given preference over curative measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote that to illustrate the direction that is being taken in the European countries, at least by the European Ministers responsible for <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs, in relation to the 1979 International Year of the Child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people within the community will be looking to the attitudes of the committees to see whether they are supportive of the child within the <span class="highlight">family</span> context particularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senate who think about the matter that <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations should have anything to do with abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the attitude of some <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations that abortion is an acceptable or desirable form of fertility control really condemns those <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations for the fact that they are not doing the job for which they were established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, there are a number of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations in the various States that receive substantial financial assistance from the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976-77 grants totalling $514,264 were approved by the then Occupational and Social Health Projects Branch of the Department of Health for disbursement to the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and the Melbourne Action Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977-78, the grants totalled $525,364, including - and I want to emphasise this-$ 149,095 for the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those members of Estimates Committee D will remember that last year I asked questions of officials of the Department of Health about the attitude of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations to abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to another honourable senator, the officials stated that <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations did not offer facilities to perform abortions, but that they did offer advice on abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is not very much dispute about the fact that some <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations offer advice about abortion in the context of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major objective of this motion is to draw the attention of the Senate, and indeed of the people of Australia, to the development of an attitude in some <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations, that attitude being that abortion is an acceptable and indeed a safe method of birth control, fertility control or even of conception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of this attitude within government-funded <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations is something which raises the question of continued funding of these bodies if there has been a change from their policies when the grants were first initiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have mentioned previously, to me, a <span class="highlight">family</span> planning association which advocates abortion as an acceptable form of fertility control is a damning indictment of its own effectiveness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations which have recognised the danger of being caught up in this new approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Tasmania is one such organisation which recognises the danger of being caught up in this new approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To relieve poverty, to prevent ill-health in the special field of <span class="highlight">family</span> life and to reduce the incidence of abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to contrast this with the views of people associated with the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association who appear to be adopting an attitude which is heading in a different direction altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer firstly to the comment by Professor Charles Kerr on 7 February 1978, soon after his election to the post of  President  of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But another official of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association has gone further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Director of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association, Judy McLean, was interviewed on the ABC  Broadband  program in March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was done for instance like <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Clinics that are dotted right throughout the metropolitan area the cost of it would go down and it would be a feasible method of birth control . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not unaware of the fact that shortly after I raised that matter in the Senate Estimates Committee hearing, the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations, at its annual general meeting declared: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government might reply by saying: ‘We certainly provide money to the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations and they redistribute it to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Associations to apply its own policy to its constituent bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the situation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate passes this motion then it will serve notice on the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations that they can continue to receive public moneys, that is government grants, for legitimate activity in the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning area but once they cross the line and become merely abortion referral agencies under the guise of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, they will receive no further support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not forget that that argument is advanced by the director of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association which receives massive financial support from the taxpayers’ pockets, that is from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if this motion is passed by the Senate it will go a long way to ensuring that <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations do the job for which they were established and that they do not engage in acting as referral agencies for abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  unbelievable and totally unwarranted attack on  Mr Bruce  Goodluck, MHR over the sale of the ferry pontoons; his recent incredible predictions about alleged alterations to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowance Scheme, and now the fact that within four days he has apparently forgotten how he voted on motions at a mass public meeting in Hobart, all give cause for grave concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Government, through public pressure, has been able to reverse some other decisions made in the Budget-  Senator Guilfoyle  who is in charge of the Senate tonight as recently as Tuesday told us that she would introduce amending legislation to the Budget in respect of the decision to stop the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in cases where children earned income- I hope that the Government in its wisdom will do the same in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be understood that the only <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions which can be arranged are those which fall within the terms of this agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the $98,000 which has been allocated to the <span class="highlight">family</span> research project at the University of New South Wales for 1978-79 intended to have particular reference to the stated objectives of the International Year of the Child, that is, to raise the level of services to children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I further ask whether this research project, which was initiated in 1972 and has received a total allocation of $314,000 since then, has published the results of its research into the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know what that means in terms of a Greek migrant child in the inner suburbs of Melbourne who is told that  Senator Carrick  is concerned about quality in education, but I know that it is very important for that Greek migrant child to have the benefit of multilingual teaching in the school, to have the benefit of teachers who can speak in his language and in that of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, who can speak to his parents, and who can help him to assess his identity in a difficult situation and in a difficult environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must place on record my thanks to my wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> for their encouragement and help, and especially for their inspiration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a time when the Australian people are being subjected to hardships and uncertainties, resulting in many cases in the breakdown of the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These people have learned to value constructive work and to value <span class="highlight">family</span> life, not in a wowserish reaction to the distorted radicals of recent years but by positive search for fulfilment and enrichment of life and by encouragement of those things which are strong and lovely and of good report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general this is true, as is evidenced principally by the temporary measure to raise income tax rates by 1  lA  per cent for all incomes rather than to concentrate the new tax burden on only one section of the community, as would have been the case if the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance had been reduced significantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its effects are not just confined to the person unemployed, but they are felt throughout the whole structure of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are also looked after in this country by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Welcome as the Government’s withdrawal was, this diversion should not cloud the important fact, that by not increasing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances since their introduction the value of these allowances has been eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances was not an increased government expenditure; it was a transfer of moneys from the old tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The extent of the erosion of <span class="highlight">family</span> income, which has occurred since this Government came to power, was demonstrated in a table prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It showed that families with children which had one bread winner earning an income on or below average weekly earnings were up to $ 1 1 a week worse off as a result of the present Government’s tax policies and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes no mention of restoring maternity allowances, indexing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, indexing additional pensions for children or of increasing those pensions below the Henderson poverty line to the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a totally unexpected attackonthemostseverelydisadvantaged people in our community through the decision to cut back the indexation of age pensions from a six-month to a 12-month frequency; by imposing new tax burdens on other recipients of social security pensions; by taxing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances through the mechanism of taxing children’s incomes; by abolishing the maternity allowance, which was a very minor form of assistance to families; by imposing a totally inequitable form of increased taxation through indirect taxes which, of course, fall more heavily on the poor than on the rich; and by failing entirely to raise new and proper sources of revenue from the very rich and fruitful enterprises which are carried out in the minerals and energy sector of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs refers to the arrest this week of  Mr Steve  Biko ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span> in South Africa, on the first anniversary of Biko’s controversial death in detention in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Australian Government protest to the South African Government and call for the immediate release of the Biko <span class="highlight">family</span> and others similarly detained? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be able to respond to that, one would need to know the circumstances and the alleged claims which have given rise to the arrest of the Biko <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many hundreds and thousands of women and children who have got into difficulties through the problems associated with nuclear families in this country, who have become split away from the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>, and who have had nowhere to go, have been helped by women’s shelters in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> had to do everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brought down in the Budget was the so-called newsboys’ tax under which the parents of a dependent child who received an income above a stipulated level would be ineligible for a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their perception of reality and the incomes of dependent children is of course related to children who receive income from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts set up for the purpose of evading taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But instead of doing the logical thing and tightening up on the tax laws on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts which have enabled people such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and no doubt virtually all the senior Ministers of this Government to evade taxation, they thought it would be a better idea to phase out <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for dependent children who have incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A tightening up of the laws on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts would have affected them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided that instead of doing the logical thing and tightening up the provisions which enable people to dodge taxes through <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, and because that taxdodging potential provides more money than the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for the Prime Minister and others, they decided to knock off the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance instead of tightening up on the taxation laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Walsh,  who led for the Opposition, took us through a rather circuitous bypath of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and other matters which were challenged by honourable senators on this side as being somewhat irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that most primary producers are familiar with the concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> partnerships, <span class="highlight">family</span> companies, and, in some cases, <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts which are used to arrange their affairs in a businesslike manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This takes on added importance when senior people are in good health, active in mind and body, close to community affairs and close at hand to <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should always recognise that the problems they face mainly are personal ones which have kept them apart from <span class="highlight">family</span> and friends, and that their way of life without a settled environment adds to the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it starts with people who are forced to live in small flats, perhaps going back to the <span class="highlight">family</span> home, and leads to baby bashing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost inevitable that at some time during the life of such a <span class="highlight">family</span> one of the children will reach the stage of becoming homeless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, deals with the means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister now give an unqualified assurance to the people of Australia that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will not be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that in August we discussed the income testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances on the basis of income in the hands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following our party meeting today, at the Press conference which is held subsequent to each party meeting I advised the Press that last night the Cabinet had made a decision that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would be means tested on the basis of income received by children at a threshold of income in excess of $1040 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, if a child is in receipt of income of $20 per week the means test will be applied to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The income that will be exempt from <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance testing will be maintenance payments received on behalf of children, scholarship income including Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances, superannuation compensation, pension income, and trust income derived from deceased parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a free area of income of $20 per week on means tested pensions, and the same threshold is now to be applied to the income testing for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure is based on a threshold of $1,040 per annum and a $ 1 for $4 withdrawal rate; that is, that a first child may earn $20 a week and indeed will continue to receive some <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance until his income has reached $34. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A chart is available which shows the abatement of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance on that basis of $1 for $4 withdrawal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should make it quite clear that the income testing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is to be on the bas,is of the child’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that when the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced, two factors were put together- the old child endowment scheme and the taxable rebate scheme for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an income test on the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances, orphans pensions, handicapped child’s allowance and additional pensions or benefits for a child will generally no longer be payable in respect of children who are classed as living abroad on a permanent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No change is contemplated in the conditions under which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the double orphans pension and the handicapped child’s allowance are available to people, including Australian Government employees, who are temporarily absent from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should explain that the general purpose behind the proposal is to prevent the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the double orphans pension or the handicapped child’s allowance and the additional pension or benefit that is paid on behalf of children who are unlikely to come to Australia, regardless of whether they have been here before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The statement I just made in response to a question from  Senator Harradine  outlined the detail of the Cabinet decision which was made last night with regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance income test on income held in the hands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous discussion in this place in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances occurred as a result of the statement in the Budget that an income test would be applied to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances at the level of an income of $3 12 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review did take place and in response to a question from  Senator Harradine  I announced that the Cabinet had decided that an income testing arrangement would be introduced for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, taking into account a threshold income of $1,040 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the matter of whether the decision will be revenue producing, in response to a question asked by  Senator Grimes  I did state that it is estimated that there would be a saving of some $3 lm in a full year on an income testing arrangement of this type if the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance were to abate on a $ 1 for $4 withdrawal over an income level of $20 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now tell the Senate that on review the Cabinet has decided that income of $20 a week or $ 1 ,040 per annum will be the level at which the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will be income tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation has been reviewed and $20 a week is the level at which from 1 January next year <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will be income tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that as a result of a second thought by the Government the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have been reconsidered but it cannot be denied by the Government that in its original Budget Speech the newsboy who was selling newspapers or the kids who were running messages and perhaps earning a few dollars a week had to fill in an income statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending on the amount of money they earned by running messages or selling newspapers their mothers’ <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would have been reduced accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed my conviction that most Australians believe in the system of free enterprise democracy which is based on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, which admits the profit motive within the law as being satisfactory to the desires and the dictates of human nature, which admits equality of opportunity, which admits that freedom is a relatively meaningless concept unless it is experienced within a properly conceived and majority held and enforced discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Social Security aware that on 22 August she answered questions from Senators Harradine and Gietzelt by giving assurances that income derived from personal exertion of a child would not be included in an income test for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowancesassurances quite unrelated to any specific amount? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the previous answers that I gave to questions from several honourable senators with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time we were talking of the Cabinet decision, as announced in the Budget, that income over $312 per annum received by children would be subjected to means testing for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review that was undertaken subsequently by the Cabinet of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme and the means testing proposal resulted in the conclusion that a means test should be applied if income were received in excess of $20 a week or $1,040 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About two million families receive <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and in order to apply a means or income test it will be necessary to ask all of them to return information to the department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be borne in mind in seeking to means test the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance at a level of income of $1,040, that that is the level at which pensions are means tested for receipt of the full pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that to use the same level of exempt income can be accepted as appropriate in means testing for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present we have no record of the income of children or of families because of the universal nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, will the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance be withheld, or partly withheld, from mothers of those children who between June 1977 and June 1978 earned and spent income of more than $20 a week, unaware that a mother would be penalised for the whole of the next year because of what had been earned in the previous year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is means testing of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, is she saying that two million Australian families will now be under continual scrutiny by this Government as to how much any child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> may earn? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, what sanctions does the Government intend to use against any <span class="highlight">family</span> that may be, or may be said to be, in breach of the new Government policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision that I have announced on the means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is a Government decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer her to the Senate  Hansard  of 22 August of this year and in particular to page 230 where, in answer to a question by  Senator Harradine  relating to the means testing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, she said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister further to page 234 where, in answer to a question from  Senator Gietzelt  again on the matter of the means testing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, she is reported as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware also of the fact that at the time the answers were given the Government was reviewing the decision which had been announced in the Budget- that at an income level of $3 12 per annum an income test would be applied to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a situation where there is insecurity one gets <span class="highlight">family</span> arguments and <span class="highlight">family</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I predict that, because of the excise that has been imposed and because the growers in the Riverland area cannot sell their grapes, there will be great pressures on families there and <span class="highlight">family</span> breakups will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first opportunity that the Opposition has had to comment on the Government’s newproposals for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second, and equally important, matter is what will happen to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme when the changes are introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall start by pointing out that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was introduced in August 1976 as a replacement for the child endowment scheme and the tax rebates which were available in respect of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under any system the rebate would have been indexed and increased according to the increase in the rate of inflation, and the Opposition pointed out at the time that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance similarly should be indexed and should increase at the same rate as inflation if it were to be a reasonable replacement for the tax rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important factor is that these <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments, except in the few cases where there is no mother, are paid to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recognised by the Opposition and the Government at the time of the introduction of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much was made in that debate of the fact that the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was a recognition of the work of the mother in the home- inadequate as that recognition may have been- and was an important part payment to a mother to assist her in rearing a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never been suggested, since child endowment was introduced or since the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced, that these payments should be considered a pension in any sense of the word and available only to those who pass a certain means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August 1976 when the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced there was much fanfare and backslapping but we on this side of the chamber had some suspicion that it was being introduced to avoid the indexation of the tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also had some suspicion that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would not be increased regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quickly recognised, on both sides of the House, outside the Parliament, in the media and by various organisations- one could go on endlessly naming the organisations which recognised this fact- that this was going to be unfair and would produce the ridiculous situation whereby paper boys and kids who work in milk bars, chemist shops and so on, would be deprived of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances because they were earning a few dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I want to concentrate on another important aspect- the injustices and the administrative difficulties which will arise following the introduction of this new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could call it the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme mark III in view of the changes we have had to it since it was introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of the Minister’s answers to questions asked in the Senate is important and will be taken up later, but the Government should not be allowed to cover up the fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme has lost much of its benefit and that the changes will have serious effects on those who come under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future if they earn sufficient money they will be torn between having these little extras and taking away from their mother the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance money she needs to feed, shelter and clothe them and to assist in providing them with the normal necessities of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one of her children earned $30 a week by working weekends in a supermarket, which many children do- I know children who do this- she would in fact lose her <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for that child, she would be forced further below the poverty line than she was before and the child’s efforts to assist his mother to achieve a more reasonable level of income would be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the first child earns sufficient money to cause the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance received by his mother for him to be eliminated, it would seem from the answers given by the Minister in the past that the second child will attract a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance of only $3.50 a week instead of $5 a week and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for the third child will be reduced to $5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, a mother of three children who has one child who becomes ineligible for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will lose not only the $3.50 a week in respect of that child but also $2.50 a week in respect of the next two children, who will become respectively the first and second children instead of the second and third children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She will forego some $6 a week in <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, from July 1977 to June 1978 a child may have been earning $20, $25 or $30 a week completely unaware that in the 1978-79 Budget the Government would introduce a proposal which would deprive his mother of part or all of her <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in 1979, depending on what was earned from July 1977 to June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens to the child who earns, say, $30 or $25 a week when he is 15 and who at the end of that year leaves school, earns an income and therefore is not eligible to attract a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the child who is in his last year at school will get the full <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance when he is 1 5 years of age and that the following year that <span class="highlight">family</span> would not be affected because the child would no longer be eligible for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, that child ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span> would have a considerable advantage over the <span class="highlight">family</span> whose child continues at school for two or more years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third difficulty is that this proposal would well force back into dependency single working parents who, without the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, are better off receiving a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite wrong to deprive single parents, widows or any other low income people in the community of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance on the basis of what their children earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is made to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deprive a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance on the basis of what the children earn in an effort to assist that <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income is quite wrong and may well put it back into a situation of dependency on the Government which it does not want and in which it need not be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases, the drop in the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, as I demonstrated with the case of the widow, will be such as to cause people to drop below the poverty line if they are not already there now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child may not be able to earn the same amount of income in 1979 or he may consider it better not to do so if his mother is to lose the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in 1 980 as a result of his earning income in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> may decide to forgo the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance because of the child ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively- this unfortunately will happen- the <span class="highlight">family</span> may decide not to declare the child’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in the Budget documents an increase of only five staff was allowed in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance section when the previous proposals were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will they be automatically refused a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are poor migrant families or poor families of any group in the community who through no fault of their own do not get their income statements in on time to be arbitrarily deprived of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for which they are presently eligible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth mentioning in passing that the Minister gave as the reason for putting a limit of $20 a week on a child’s income before he or she will lose any <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance that this would bring the amount into line with the limit for pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the parents of these children really be deprived of their <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in 1979 on the basis of something their children earned in 1977 and 1978? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances was welcome and was not opposed by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal will also affect some women in the community who sometimes find that the only income or personal money they receive is the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Far be it from me to try to improve on  Senator Grimes’s  criticism of the Government policy but it seems to me that there is a central issue on the subject of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which is unacceptable and which he has not chosen to emphasise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not put my name on the list of speakers in this debate with an intention to speak on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central issue of government policy on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is: What is a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were introduced by our Government they were justified as a transfer of income from husband to wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is the mother’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now to reduce the mother’s income because of the child’s income seems to be the most hopeless muddle of thinking on what a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was income for the mother and a transfer of income from husband to wife, from father to mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has rightly decided that it will try to do away with a tax dodge, a system of spreading <span class="highlight">family</span> income across all members of a <span class="highlight">family</span>, including dependent children, so that the tax that would otherwise be payable on the income, in most cases of the father, cannot be reduced by an artificial spreading of his income across his children and possibly also his wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is so easy to pick on because it is a government payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, many of us applauded the Government’s decision to split income between the father and mother by taking away the rebate which went to the father and paying it in the form of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance- not means tested- to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to get at <span class="highlight">family</span> income which is being artificially spread it ought to get fair dinkum about its methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance provision, as I saw it, was a first step towards some sort of proper distribution of income in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment was a recognition of the fact that the mothers of Australia make a real contribution to the economy of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made sure that the mothers got, in their own names, an income related to their <span class="highlight">family</span> position, namely, that of being a mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I looked forward to the next step being taken by which we would have rationalised further the concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I looked forward to the Government’s pursuing that first step and, recognising the value of the mother to the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia, taking a rational next step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has done has completely cut across the original rationale for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is not income for the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it bears no relationship at all to the original rationale for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, and that is the point that I think we have to pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel it is important, if we are to resolve the problem satisfactorily, that we get off this angle and back on to the original rationale for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and require the Government to justify its actions in the light of the original rationale for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say just a few words on the controversial issue of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and on the attitude of the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to the whole matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I congratulate  Senator Martin  on the whole of her address, but particularly on her remarks concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have never accepted the payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance as being a salary paid to the mother, nevertheless I think that  Senator Martin  made a good case for this being so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has been accepted as such by the Government, I agree that it is unfortunate that the mother should suffer because of the income received by someone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to make myself conversant with this whole matter of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, I have read every question that has been asked, every answer that has been given and every statement that has been made on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard today that the assurance that income earned by children through personal exertion would not affect eligibility to receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would have applied only if the income ceiling had remained at $3 12 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we go back further than 22 August, which is the date that has been the subject of most of the discussion, we find, firstly, that it was announced on the Tuesday night that the Budget was brought down that the Government would be taking into consideration the reduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances where the income of a child was in excess of $312 a year and that it would be done on the basis of income in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recognised by honourable senators that the separate net income can arise from splitting a <span class="highlight">family</span> income, from trust accounts, from partnership arrangements and from various other sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole concern of the Minister was that we should take into account income received from trust accounts and splitting <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, concerns the means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the introduction of a means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances aimed principally at wealthy children who receive an unearned income through inherited property or through devices such as income splitting by trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the cost to revenue of exempting from the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance means test any income earned by the personal endeavour of the dependent child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced the means test on children’s income after reflecting on the fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme replaced the tax rebate which had previously been given to parents for a dependent child - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hamer  ‘s question related to the justification of applying it to the child of a wealthy <span class="highlight">family</span> who is receiving an income from <span class="highlight">family</span> income splitting, from trust accounts and from investments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again, as I said last week, that, in taking this decision, the Government had in mind circumstances where, as a result of trusts and other income splitting devices, children receive separate income whilst their parents continue to receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words ‘unintended consequences’ express the Government’s intention that the means test should not apply to incomes other than incomes received from the splitting of <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes,  trust accounts, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister recognised that it covered income from personal exertion but the Government’s aim, she stated, was to cover income from <span class="highlight">family</span> splitting arrangements and trusts; therefore instructions had been issued to draft legislation which would ensure that the Government’s intention, to take into account income from trusts or <span class="highlight">family</span> splitting arrangements, would be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that such a distinction would ensure an equitable result in the application of the Budget announcement relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we see,  Senator Knight’s  question also followed that of  Senator Hamer  in the previous week, in reply to which the Minister had said, We do not want the legislation to have unintended consequences ‘, the consequences being to take into consideration income other than from <span class="highlight">family</span> wage-splitting arrangements and trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these devices are used the Government believes that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should not be paid . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought- perhaps again due to my inability to interpret properly an answer- that the whole attitude of the Minister was such as to lead this Senate to the belief that under the new arrangements, when the legislation was brought down it would cover incomes in excess of $312 from the splitting of <span class="highlight">family</span> income and from trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister now give an unqualified assurance to the people of Australia that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will not be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Budget did say that all income above $312 would be taxed, it would cause such hardship and inequity, and there had been such an adverse public reaction to it, that the Government had now changed its view and she could give an unqualified assurance that the legislation which she was having prepared would apply the provision to income from trust accounts and <span class="highlight">family</span>  splitting devices only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of her answers to questions asked earlier this week, can the Minister give an estimate of the number of mothers who will not receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance next year because of their children’s separate incomes from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and partnership arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not able to give any figures on the means testing of the separate income of children from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts or from income splitting devices that may have been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Government is saying that it will apply only to <span class="highlight">family</span> income splitting arrangements, trust funds and other such practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was present at the Cabinet meeting which made the decision about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances because she told me so in answer to a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a simple change was necessary to make <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances liable to a means test if a child or children received UNEARNED income above a certain level, as would be the case with a trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Government was aware of the implications of means testing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances when it included the provision in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter has been dealt with in the past, when the proposition was that any income over $315 a year earned by a child by selling newspapers, collecting a few bottles, doing odd jobs at the local store or working on Saturday morning would deprive his mother from receiving in full the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter has been debated here in such a way that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  was forced to retreat from that position and say fairly clearly in this place that income earned from personal exertion would not be considered when assessing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance would remain protected from such earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal exertion on the part of children in order to support their families in difficult circumstances is in some way to limit the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many children participate in some activity to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> income and $20 a week is really only a small amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has shown extreme disloyalty to one of his Ministers who gave a clear assurance to the Senate that the policy of the Government was not to persist with the proposal to take into account when calculating the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance the earnings of children derived from their personal exertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely they will look at the money they have earned and the manner in which they have earned it and say: ‘Why should someone take any of this away from me when the <span class="highlight">family</span> to which I belong has a need for it?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attack on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance of a mother through her child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Minister has given a clear assurance to the Senate that the policy of the Government is that if it is clear that the income of children is earned by personal exertion it will not be taxed and it will not in any way affect the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see what happens when the legislation is introduced and the Government has to take a vote on this change in policy which proposes that the income that a child may earn without affecting the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is to be increased from $6 to $20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The genius of  Sir Thomas  Playford in this regard was that he recognised that most of the component of the cost of living for the ordinary average <span class="highlight">family</span> derived from the cost of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the representations and protests by various organisations within and outside the Parliament had any effect on the Government’s Budget proposals to income test <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and to tax invalid pensions and allowances payable to rehabilitees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GUILFOYLE The Government has reviewed all aspects of the proposed changes that were announced in the Budget and subsequently with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the administrative complexities and the inequities which could arise between families with regard to the means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, it has been decided that the present arrangement for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme will be a universal benefit on behalf of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced in the Budget, there will no longer be dual payments of the TEAS allowance and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, but the TEAS allowance has been increased to take account of that change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of the effect of these changes on the Budget is that it was expected that some $16m would have been saved in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance area and some $3m in the other pension area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following publication of the <span class="highlight">family</span> services report, has the Federal Government, as the largest single employer in the nation, been able to increase opportunity of employment by the use of flexible working hours to enable parents, particularly lone parents, to combine as a choice work and caring for their children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do I understand the position to be, as I gathered from  Senator Guilfoyle  ‘s reply, that any earnings of school children will not be taken into account in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  has given an answer with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it further the case that one of the major drains on funds has proved to be the separate representation of children in <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court proceedings, as directed by judges of that court in the exercise of their powers under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the very least, will the Government consider making an urgent separate allocation of funds to cover the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act cases to which I have referred specifically? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a transfer payment from the average taxpayer, frequently a young married man with a <span class="highlight">family</span>, to enable an employer to pay a young teenager more than the employer thinks he is worth, and it occurs at a time when that teenager has more money to spend on himself than he will have for most of the rest of his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The current so-called crackdown on tax evasion certainly lacks credibility, as the editorial of the  Australian Financial Review  pointed out again today, when we consider that again it is a matter of public record that several, if not most, of the Ministers of this Government have tax dodging <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts on which the Government has no intention of cracking down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this year’s Budget- and this is by no means an exhaustive list- the deficit has been cosmetically reduced by $35m by changing the timing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments in a way which effectively deferred the payment of one week’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance from the current financial year until the next financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This last week of this three-week sitting has been the period in which the Government has recognised that to undermine an allowance such as the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, even by the suggestion of means testing a mother’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance by taking into account the income derived from the personal exertion of children, is an attack on a fundamental institution which, rather than being undermined, needs support to overcome the very problem with which this country is faced- the unemployment problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s response to that situation has always been to say: ‘Well, in 1976 we instituted the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which provided substantial increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Martin  pointed out in her speech last week, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was simply a trade-off for the loss of tax rebate and child endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact in the year in which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances replaced the tax rebate and child endowment scheme, it was estimated that the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would cost an additional $785m a year but that that amount would be balanced by the wiping out of the tax rebate and child endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to have incorporated in  Hansard  a comparison between the tax rebate and child endowment scheme and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even under the old scheme which was inadequate and when the child endowment had not been indexed, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with six children would have been $7.43 a week better off than under the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus I was very surprised when, during the parliamentary recess, the Leader of Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  and  Senator Grimes  suggested that the Government intended to income test or tax <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was concerned that this would be a furphy and that it was a smokescreen to cover up the Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am talking about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the honourable senator to commit his party to the full indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept now that the official policy of the Australian Labor Party supports the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see where the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will take us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this to-ing and fro-ing of tactics with regard to the income testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances because of the personal exertion of children, I believe, was a smokescreen to cover up the fact that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children is now $8.55 a week worse off because of the erosion of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance as a result of price increases since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that if realistic <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and homemakers’ allowances were provided a great many of our social and employment ills would be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we have a situation in which a post-graduate scholar with a familysome 40 per cent of such scholars are married- is earning very little more than a man with similar <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities who is on the dole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During  Senator Harradine  ‘s speech he said that the claim made during the winter recess that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for the first child was to be abolished in the Budget was a furphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine should refer to where  Senator Ryan  said that she was opposed to the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Canberra branch of the Women’s Action Alliance (a national body of concerned women) sent a questionnaire to all ACT election candidates, seeking their views on indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan replied no to our question: ‘Do you support removing the present economic discrimination against single-income families by (1) indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If lifting bins is involved, then I think we do a disservice in giving such a heavy manual job to a married man with a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether suitability includes his physique and consideration of whether he is married with a <span class="highlight">family</span>, but we may find that he is better suited to a job where he will not be tempted to repeat the mistakes that have occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say that with some feeling because I am dealing at the moment with a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion case involving a woman of 8 1 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The years are not on her side, and as the weeks go by that woman may be precluded at the latter end of her life from being with her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are exemptions from payment for those people who are under the age of 18 years, and I think that someone mentioned that where a <span class="highlight">family</span> finds the payment to be a burden it would be appropriate to exempt the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) That the Senate concurs in the following modifications to the resolution of the Senate relating to the proposed Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act contained in message No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some qualifications about the terms of reference of the select committee being enlarged to include a consideration of the effects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that there was really no data, just a host of subjective value judgments about what the effects of that legislation have been on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I probably have some reservations similar to his own as to the widening of the terms of reference of the proposed joint select committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, although I think that surely this is a matter which the members of the committee should very much have in mind in their own determination of the matters before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have felt that there has been perhaps a somewhat inadequate interest in the subject of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation in the House of Representatives in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button raised the matter of the addition to the terms of reference of the following paragraph:  its effect on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A massive amount of evidence was called about the position of the divorce grounds and the effect on the institution of marriage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this committee is to proceed to come up with practical working suggestions as to the way in which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should operate, obviously it will not want to be delayed by having a very long investigation, a sort of rehearing of evidence already given to the Senate before the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation was introduced in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very significant that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act provided for the creation of an institute of <span class="highlight">family</span> studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council has been in operation and it has before this Parliament recommendations that have not been dealt with yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies has not really got underway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the committee will not go through the exercise of reinvestigating the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which I believe is a substantially excellent Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with  Senator Button  in hoping that the widening of the terms of reference, which naturally is a matter that ought be within the compass of the committee to consider, will not take the major aspect of the Committee’s attention, but that the committee will be a practical, useful working committee that comes forward with some fairly quick solutions to the problems which are bedevelling <span class="highlight">family</span> law at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been more than interested to hear what  Senator Button  and  Senator Missen  have said in relation to the variations to the committee that will look at the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act as proposed in the message that we have received from the House of Representatives and the addition to the terms of reference of paragraph (ia) concerning the effects of the Act on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I hope that there will be a response from the community to this widening of the terms of reference to include the effects of the Act on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I am not sure at this stage what the mechanical movements of this Committee will be in relation to its review and its hearings, I hope that an opportunity will be provided to those organisations that are concerned with the institutions of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> to make their representations, whether they be in the form of evidence, in writing or in the form of interviews. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that concerned organisations, such as community organisations, church, religious and other social organisations within our society, will take note of this opportunity which is now being provided and that in the comparatively short time the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has been in force they will have been able to review what its effects have been and give the Committee the benefit of their experience, observation and advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances have not been indexed since they were introduced and thus their value has fallen by over 27 per cent since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds for <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services have been reduced by 6.3 per cent in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was confused, for instance, about the means test which was to apply to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances of families where the children receive an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to tax <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts- I understand that this was the purpose of introducing this legislationthere are to my mind two opportunities for it to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is when the trust is set up and the other is when the trust can be used because with a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust there is either an age limit or a time limit set for when the money can be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My argument is: Why should a female parent have her <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance penalised when she cannot touch the trust? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way she can touch any of that money and it is generally not available for some years after she has lost the use of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of them were in similar <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances to  Mr Aper? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr President  stated this morning,  Mr Aper  had a physique which was an indication to the employing officer that he would be capable of carrying out kitchen hand duties and, in addition, he was married with a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if those two things are the qualifications for a kitchen hand then it is likely that other members of the public who applied for that position were also of a similar physique and also could have been married with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  spoke earlier of the social worker who pointed out that a <span class="highlight">family</span> was delighted because the daughter was not now smoking cannabis but was on alcohol and getting drunk every weekend to a marked degree; at least she was not smoking cannabis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the very point I was making last night, that these particular people have no confidence in or respect for <span class="highlight">family</span> standards and values and desire to see that the <span class="highlight">family</span> standards and values which are needed for the strength of this country are undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That interjection concerned the Labor Party policy in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did you call for the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine should refer to where  Senator Ryan  said that she was opposed to the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proved that so far as a national organisation of women in this country is concerned  Senator Ryan  was opposed to the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and that she had replied to it in respect of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It includes a statement of a questionnaire which was forwarded to all members of parliament in the Australian Capital Territory in respect of a number of <span class="highlight">family</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 is: ‘Do you support removing the present economic discrimination against the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> by indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, because  Senator Ryan  is not present tonight I am restrained in saying other things which I feel should be explained to the Senate and to the people of Canberra as to her attitudes about the questions which are vital to the future of <span class="highlight">family</span> life in this nation, including the fact that of everybody in Australia she was selected to open the Fourth Homosexual National Conference in Sydney this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem would then confront that senior Minister and the Government might have to re-think all of its economic and <span class="highlight">family</span> support policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last evening in this place a mild exchange took place between  Senator Harradine, Senator Wriedt  and myself about an issue relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not intend to canvass the issue of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances, of course, have a lot to do with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Government is as concerned as the Treasurer says it is about the loss of revenue it suffers through tax dodging, why has it done nothing about such abuses as occur through the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have never had the occasion or the opportunity to resort to any use at all of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts or to any form of tax dodging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Had it not been for the pressures- I might add they were pressures from the Opposition and also from a whole range of community groups throughout Australia- the Government would have attacked <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances much more severely than it did and would have means tested income earned by children; what has become widely known as the ‘newsboys’ tax’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I guess we cannot expect taxation justice or any taxation morality from a government of which nearly all the senior Ministers, despite all their public posturing about cracking down on tax evasion, participate directly in tax dodging <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Hayden,  endeavoured to show in the House of Representatives that a resource tax would bring in $ 1 50m, a tax on windfall gains of the oil companies could bring in $340m, a capital gains tax on those people who make such gains over and above $200,000 could raise $300m, a tax on the highest level of personal income could raise another $200m and that closing exery tax avoidance scheme, whether it be <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts or otherwise, and taking punitive measures against those people who persist in this form of avoidance would bring in $100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now find at the end of the Income Year in which I married, and after paying $190.40 to Medibank Private, that husbands and wives living together are defined as ‘dependent upon each other’, and that as he therefore has a ‘dependent’, the husband must pay the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Rate under the Health Insurance Levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it is inappropriate for the Australian taxpayer to contribute to the support of persons who are permanently resident overseas, who have never been resident in Australia and who may never come to Australia; the rates of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the size of the tax rebates for dependants are set in the light of Australian conditions and, in many cases, would be over-generous having regard to the cost of maintaining a dependant overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Registered organisations should frame their rules so that in assessing when the exclusion has been met by the contributor it should regard a <span class="highlight">family</span> as one unit and total the days or number of services or cost of services or days used by the whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you are in real trouble- I don’t mean just like the drinking charge I read about a few months back, but something that your own people can’t help with- something which might be helped by a white man interested in hearing blackfeller secrets if they want to tell him and willing to tell whitefeller secrets if people want to hear them- then I would like you to think of me as a former <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor who had a large following of Aboriginal patients years ago, who took time to explain things to them and who would like to be thought of as your friend whether our politics is the same or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>many of the people on Goulburn Island have <span class="highlight">family</span> and ceremonial links with the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers and Oenpelli areas; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 represent the Croker Island community and they are very interested indeed in the land the subject of the agreement as many of the people there have <span class="highlight">family</span> and ceremonial and language ties with the Aligator Rivers area and the Oenpelli people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian citizen who was born into a <span class="highlight">family</span> that had been Christian for generations and who changed his or her religious beliefs to the Jewish faith would come under this blanket discrimination by the Syrian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was intended to introduce an administratively difficult and unjust means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which would partly have the effect of penalising poor families whose children helped out by earning small amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system was introduced it was pointed out from this side of the House that unless the payments were indexed for inflation their value would drop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who were so reliant on them and the people who were initially advantaged by the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, the low income earners, would suffer unless there was a regular upgrading of these payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this legislation the children of pensioners or beneficiaries who manage to get one or other of the tertiary scholarships available in this country will not have <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances paid on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have the situation, once this legislation comes into being, where the children of those who are well off, who have no scholarship, will attract the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance while the children of the poor, those in the lower and middle income groups, who have a scholarship, will attract no allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people will not in fact receive a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not make up for it and it does not get away from the argument,  Senator, that  your children and my children- separate children- who may not have scholarships will attract <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances whereas the children of the poor - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added to these thingsthat the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is eroded in value, that the allowances for pensioners’ children and the allowance for rental assistance have been eroded because they have not been increased, and that children who get a tertiary allowance of some kind will not have the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance paid in respect of them- other things have been done without warning, such as the maternity benefit being abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, supplementary benefits and rent allowances have been eroded in the last three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Baume  knows, I will accept a means test; I will accept an efficient means of distribution; I will accept an abolition of a maternity benefit and the introduction of proper <span class="highlight">family</span> support paymentsanything he likes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving the <span class="highlight">family</span>, a further reason for our opposition to this Bill is the Government’s complete about-face on pensions for people over 70 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The migrant community, rightly or wrongly, is deeply suspicious of the restrictions introduced on the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and other benefits overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  West Australian  of Saturday, 14 October, points out in its editorial, in talking about the decision to change from twice yearly to once a year indexation of pensions- it had previously talked about the changes to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme from which the Government withdrew: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He berated the Government for what might have been- about the fact that the Government, in the Budget, decided to tax some income earned by children by reducing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance paid to the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Senator Grimes  went on to say that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance had been abolished for those parents whose children were getting a Tertiary Education Assistance scheme allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed that this, according to me, would make up for the non-payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has extended the eligibility for the handicapped children’s allowance to include lesser handicapped children, substantially handicapped children, where the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was done not for the wealthy but for cases where the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was introduced and this, despite what the Opposition could possibly say, was the biggest boon to the very low income families that it was possible for any government to introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rebates were taken away from the father when the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was introduced, but previously the low income father with a large number of children was never able to claim all the rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that this Government introduced the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and the full amount that he would have been able to claim had he been on a higher income was given to his wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was not of any greater assistance than the previous arrangements to higher income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance certainly assisted people on lower incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also introduced the <span class="highlight">family</span> support services program, which was announced earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have continued what was a remarkable new policy with regard to the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance introduced in 1976 and it will be paid monthly- a small change in the previous situation from when it was formerly paid every four weeks- but this will not make any difference at all to the amount of money received in a full calendar year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will not be paid in future to students who are recipients under the student tertiary education scheme but the TEAS allowance will be increased to take care of that disability and will be increased to compensate completely for the loss of that benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was evident in the since-abandoned move to trim <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know what happened with the scheme to trim <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, as it is delicately put here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will make an enormous difference to a large number of people throughout Australia because they have to budget from week to week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One question arises in my mind on this matter: On my calculations, the change in the method of payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances from a four-weekly basis to a monthly basis will mean that parents with four children will receive $32 less in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recipients under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and recipients of adult secondary education allowances will be precluded from receiving <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person receiving a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and a supporting mother’s benefit also receives additional benefits which are not available to that person if he or she happens to be a single parent in receipt of a TEAS allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its effects are not just confined to the person unemployed, but they are felt throughout the whole structure of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We are discussing a Bill that gives effect to the Government’s proposals in respect of changes to social service pensions and benefits, such as the unemployment benefit and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She did not really say that the Government was wrong but she intimated that perhaps people might receive less by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances now that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were being paid every month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is to be paid monthly now, it is my belief that families in receipt of an allowance will receive exactly the same amount in any one year as they would have received previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was going to income test <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and to tax the blind and the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point I raise is that the Minister said in her second reading speech that the Government will continue the new scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which it introduced in 1 976 and that this allowance will not be subject to any income test or to taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, as I understand it, the fact remains that of all the allowances and benefits, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is the only one which is not indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is totally unjust to the large numbers of families who are receiving the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I incorporated in  Hansard  on 27 September 1978 figures which show the erosion of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance rates since this allowance was introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To cut a long story short, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children is now worse off by $8 a week by way of loss of purchasing power than it was in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister is very conscious of this matter but I urge that she and the Government give urgent consideration to a renewed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and <span class="highlight">family</span> support scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place I believe that to take away anything which is supportive of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is inconsistent with what I understand to be overall government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme has some disadvantages at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  questioned some matters with regard to the payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to those who are receiving the tertiary education assistance allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to advise him that tertiary education assistance recipients have had their tertiary education assistance payments increased by an amount of $5.25 a week which takes into account the fact that there will no longer be dual payments of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and the tertiary education assistance allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes also required information for the Opposition with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for children living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state briefly that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will continue to be paid for children outside Australia where the child is temporarily absent or the child is living abroad pending migration to Australia and will arrive in Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances will cease to be payable for children who have never been in Australia and who do not intend to migrate to Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no change in the arrangements for payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for children who are already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, that is the outline of the changes with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for children abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no commitment in the Hayden alternative budget to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances despite the impression that might have been created in the Hayden Budget debate speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a matter raised by  Senator Coleman  with regard to the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which by this Bill will now be paid on a monthly basis instead of a four-weekly basis, that is, that there will be 12 payments in future years starting from May of next year in comparison with 13 payments which are made at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the maternity allowance and the other things that were raised by him with regard to support for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, of course, his remarks are understood and the Government acknowledges that benefits have been changed by this legislation; but, as I said, because of the nature of the Budget this year and the extent of the growth of social security expenditure some of these changes were deemed to be desired in this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that they can establish themselves, the parents then send their children home for several years to their grandparents because <span class="highlight">family</span> ties are very close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However later in the Bill in the case of other benefits and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, people are deprived of those benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause has been introduced because the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme is a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for children living within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme of the Government for Australian children and it will continue to be paid in cases of temporary absence or where the child will arrive within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to us to be a way in which the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme can reasonably be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no changes in arrangements for payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for children already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are taking this opportunity to say that it is a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme for the benefit of children who are in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From our point of view that is quite consistent with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme and it is an amendment which we seek at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that this provision does not refer only to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; it refers also to allowances for children of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such payments come out of what is normally described as <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a payment that was never made to children in this category until 1976 when the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us assume that two parents with their children are resident in Australia, the <span class="highlight">family</span> breaks up- there is a divorce or they just separate- and the mother goes home with the children to their country of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that if the wife has a pension entitlement she loses that pension entitlement after the break-up of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am talking about the woman who does not rely on social security because she has against her husband a court order from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a situation where the wife stayed in Australia with the children she would receive a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  what would happen in the case of a migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> settled in Australia which has left one child in its home country because of an affliction of some kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the child may be blind and the <span class="highlight">family</span> did not wish the child to leave its environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the <span class="highlight">family</span> be penalised in any way or is there an allowance paid in circumstances such as this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GUILFOYLE (Victoria-Minister for Social Security)- (2.45)-If the child had not been to Australia the <span class="highlight">family</span> would not be able to receive an allowance for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sought not only academic views from people in ivory towers but also the view of the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Catholic <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureaux, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Victorian Council of Social Service, other councils of social service and many workers in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of this benefit, combined with the failure to increase the allowances for pensioners’ children and other beneficiaries’ children and the failure to index the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will contribute to the difficulties of low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However on the basis of permanent staff, and inclusive of storage and general areas, but excluding conference facilities, the ratios are: 3rd floor 14.8 m2 per person; 2nd floor (Pensions Examinations) 9.17 m2 per person;5th floor (Computer facilities) 31.4 m1 per person; 6th floor (Finance Section) 8.4 m2 per person; 9th floor (<span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowances) 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-51-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question of the Minister for Social Security follows from a question I asked earlier about the <span class="highlight">family</span> research project at the University of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it intended that this project will continue indefinitely in order to provide the Government with a continuous data base for the formation of an adequate <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare policy in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> research project was established in 1 972 because of growing concern about the growing numbers of oneparent families in Australia and about the social and other implications of this trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The research project has published three bulletins and would have published more but for some delay in obtaining statistical material from the national <span class="highlight">family</span> survey undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics between May 1974 and February 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This data is now becoming available progressively from the Bureau and the <span class="highlight">family</span> research project expects to complete examination of it and to publish further reports by the middle of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the on-going nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> research project, it is not envisaged that it will continue for an indefinite period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is a percentage of visitors who do meet <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion or occupational criteria which make them eligible for migrant status- and would be eligible for it if they applied themselves- this body is able to imply that it has been successful in influencing the Department’s decision.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Victoria- 1975 (i) <span class="highlight">Family</span> group home; (ii) Campsite complex; (iii) Staff quarters for ‘Camp Jungai’; (iv) Boys hostel together with office accommodation; (v) Girls hostel; (vi) Departmental residence; (viii) Hostel for Secondary School Students; (viii) Boarding House for Young Workmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for legal aid is not as urgent in dissolution cases as in many other <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings, such as custody, access, maintenance, property settlement and injunction matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure to dissolve a marriage is now very simple and I believe that most people will be able to handle the work themselves with assistance where necessary from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A court fee of $100 is payable to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in respect of proceedings for dissolution of marriage, but where the applicant has been granted legal aid for those proceedings the applicant is exempt from payment of the fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Regulations at present provide for the fee to be not payable where the Registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is satisfied that payment of the fee would impose substantial hardship on the applicant and that provision will remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solicitors who act for clients who are in receipt of legal aid from the Australian Legal Aid Office are paid 90 per cent of the fees payable under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law (Costs) Regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and other superior courts much of the work can properly be handled by solicitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is desired to encourage as far as possible the settlement of ancillary matters under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act; that is, custody, access, injunction and property settlement matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aid for property applications will initially be granted up to the stage of a conference under regulation 96 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that the need for aid in this area is not as urgent as it is in other <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings, such as custody, access, maintenance and property settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the priorities in relation to aid in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction are quite clearly spelt out in the Minister’s statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the question of legal aid for dissolution of marriage proceedings in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court, the Minister went on to say that legal aid will not be granted unless circumstances exist which, in the opinion of the Australian Legal Aid Office, render it imperative that the marriage be dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to the next paragraph of it I simply make the point that although the divorce procedure is now very simple and people can get assistance from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court staff, no commitment has been made about increasing the size of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court staff in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again that matter is in an area of great concern to citizens who are involved in <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that it will cost roughly $2.50 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span> and half that for a single person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would like to warn any <span class="highlight">family</span> man who is thinking of not taking out medical insurance for his <span class="highlight">family</span> that perhaps just one visit to a general practitioner could reveal an illness that might require several visits to the doctor, X-ray treatment, pathology treatment and, finally, a consultation with a specialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to them: Insure yourselves and made sure that you are not gambling with your health or your <span class="highlight">family</span>’s health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it will be the small <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the single person who will have to pay the bulk of the new taxation increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> man who is getting almost double that- $300 a week- will pay only 5.6 per cent extra in tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly half the Bill consists of amendments to the provisions of the Act relating to the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the other amendments in the Bill are based on recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act establishes the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies as a national research and educational body, the object of which is to try to identify, and disseminate information on, the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>factors- both negative and positive- affecting marital and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large number of applications from within Australia and overseas were received, and soon after I became Attorney-General I approved the constitution of an expert panel headed by the Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia to interview applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, after further examination, it was found that the provisions, which were inserted by way of an amendment when the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was before the Senate, were defective in several other respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, most of the other amendments in the Bill are based on recommendations made to me by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that the Council, which was also established by the Act, has the function of advising the AttorneyGeneral on the working of the Act and other <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation, as well as legal aid in <span class="highlight">family</span> law and other matters relevant to this area of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since, on studying the recommendations, I felt that there were several which should be implemented at the first opportunity, when the need to amend the provisions of the Act regarding the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies arose, I asio obtained the approval of the Government to include several of those recommendations in the amending Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one of my first statements after becoming Attorney-General, 1 supported the idea of the review of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act by a parliamentary committee, which has now been approved by resolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I came to consider which of the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council could be implemented without delay, I had regard to the question whether implementation of any of the recommendations might pre-empt the findings of a parliamentary committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the important area of enforcement of orders the Bill makes two minor or clarifying amendments, one of which implements a recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council on which this is based was prompted by specific cases in which the existing provision of the Act was found to be too narrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill, appeals from magistrates’ courts to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be by way of a complete rehearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Act extended the opportunity in the original Act for parties to divorce proceedings pending at the commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to have the court decide their case on the ground of divorce under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Bill does is to enable parties in such cases who were not separated for 12 months at the commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act but who have since been separated for 12 months to have their case decided on the ground of divorce under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from amendments implementing the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council, the Bill also includes a small number of amendments of a largely formal or minor nature to facilitate the operation of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth Police can continue to be appointed as Marshal and Deputy Marshals of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it extends the power of a court of first instance to state a case to the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia and the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, which still exercises jurisdiction under the Act in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The feature that is common to all the amendments, including those recommended by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and those concerning the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, is that they are intended to facilitate the operation of the Act in the manner originally conceived by the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those who go to church on Sunday, but it is also a traditional hunting day for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is a reasonable <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion request because, as honourable senators know, it is the people under 55 years of age who are potential units in the work force about whom we are circumspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take the situation of an ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> composed of a breadwinner, his spouse and a couple of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total disposable income that that <span class="highlight">family</span> could have in order to qualify for legal aid was thus reduced from the grand sum of $85 a week- bad enough, but that is what it had been- to the miserable sum of $65 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practical terms, that means something like 2,000 cases, many of them involving <span class="highlight">family</span> law maintenance, property, custody and access matters and how distressing those matters are when they involve children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It crops up in the context of the $100 fee which is now payable to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court of Australia in dissolution matters, where it is provided that that fee can be waived if the applicant demonstrates what is described as ‘substantial hardship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such are the procedural complexities that remain under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that it is still true that most people will require legal aid and assistance if they are to be able to manage the conduct of dissolution proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They certainly will not get such assistance from the understaffed personnel of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and they certainly will not be able to get it from the grossly understaffed salaried complement of the Australian Legal Aid Office, who have been forced by the present Government to operate under severely restrictive staff ceilings- so restrictive that the ceilings have not only been not increased over the years since the Fraser Government has been in office but in fact have been reduced from 442 to 364 during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major initiative which the Government has now taken on the expenditure cutting side has been in the area of drastically revising cost scales for lawyers in the area of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court proceedings generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what the new cost scales would seem to amount to is, roughly speaking, a reduction of the return to lawyers in <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court matters from the existing 90 per cent to something like 80 per cent of their normal fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that mill there was a working environment that would be the envy of most industrialists because people were not regarded as cogs in a machine but as contributors to a joint working experience producing high quality products based on a pride in workmanship frequently handed down within the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In such a plaintive analysis, by merely examining the prefix  ‘Mrs’ to  a person’s surname, he did not account for the social implications to the divorced, the separated and the effective breadwinners often because of a strained domestic situation or because work was a means of supporting a <span class="highlight">family</span> suffering tremendous financial hardship due to illness or accident or even a means for a mother to seek relief and companionship on a five-hour twilight shift while the husband handled the <span class="highlight">family</span> pressures of a prolonged terminal illness of one of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know of any other words with which to describe the position than these: With 300 men, six 4.5 inch automatic guns and bofors one felt like a bully when bailing up a fishing boat with a Malayan <span class="highlight">family</span> on board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that today a court fee of $100 is payable to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a new matter so far as I am concerned because when I made a speech on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill on 25 August 1977 I spoke about the confusion that was arising then in regard to the costs regulations which in their original formulation had mistakes and which needed redrafting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that people who practise in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction do not know what their situation is at the present time, what their entitlements are, and their clients do not know what are the amounts that should be charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 wonder why this matter has not been given the clarification which is needed by the people who practise, and who are specialists in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only do they not cover the real situations which are found in <span class="highlight">family</span> law practice but also they do not take into account that the legal profession has been accepting a reduction of about 8 per cent per annum by reason of inflation over each of these years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another solicitor in Melbourne has written to me drawing my attention to what he describes as the total shambles of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law costs regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has drawn my attention to the case of Schulsinger in which  Mr Justice  Fogarty, a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Melbourne, had to point out that the costs scales did not apply to party and party taxations but only to taxations between a solicitor and his client. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the present guidelines are so regarded by the profession has been drawn to my attention very closely by the  President  of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Lawyers in Victoria,  Mr Ian  Kennedy, who has told me that the situation is not that 90 per cent of the costs are being paid but that the costs themselves have really greatly reduced because of not only the inflation to which I referred but also various other things which are not included in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for Social Security inform the Senate of the conditions under which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and unemployment benefit will be paid in respect of student children and school leavers during the Christmas vacation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for student children aged 1 6 years and over will be continued up to 26 December of this year, in all cases under the usual conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that provided an application is made promptly students leaving school in December will be eligible for the unemployment benefit prior to the January pay-day of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As in previous years <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are not payable on behalf of persons who are receiving unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But there is no way that these people can say in all honesty and sincerity- I believe that the majority of these people are sincerethat the standards they have established for their children will prevail once those children get out from under the influence of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes the reasons are purely and simply that women recognise that they cannot give the necessary emotional support either to a child or to another child in their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that we have all received letters from the <span class="highlight">family</span> guidance people and from even the Catholic Church guidance people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also had letters from the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations, which would probably be in more contact with people in need of an abortion, counselling or something in that area than the majority of the people in the right to life movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has also been mentioned by some of the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and abortion on demand groups who have written to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They included the Matrimonial Causes Bill 1959, the Marriage Bill 1961, the Death Penalty Abolition Bills of 1968 and 1973 and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most recently, it occurred in relation to a motion moved in the Senate to establish a committee to examine the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further, I am an adopting parent with all that that implies for this debate and what it has meant for my <span class="highlight">family</span> for me to have to take this stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who took the position that a breakdown in marital conditions should be dealt with in an enlightened way were criticised when the Parliament discussed the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would hope that the same mature consideration would be given to this debate as was given to the debates on capital punishment and <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind that shows a weakness in their position and in their ability to establish in themselves, in the community in which they live and within their <span class="highlight">family</span> the standards which they spiritually support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not like to see the process of abortion carried out on a member of my <span class="highlight">family</span>, for instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Personally, I would not like to have a member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> involved in the process of an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst the plan in relation to skills and occupational levels might be acceptable, I draw the Minister’s attention to the very low weighting of <span class="highlight">family</span> unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a total point score of 50, <span class="highlight">family</span> unity is given only 3 points and is mixed up with a number of other factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that women, in whom the Government has made a considerable investment in terms of training and development of expertise are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment while also raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was concerned that a Prime Minister, who does not care how much of the public money he spends upon himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, was prepared to use his gold pass to get into a football match. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It depended greatly on the number of deductions a person had, the size of his income, the size of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the negotiations that have been proceeding for some considerable time now for the transfer to the Commonwealth of power with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> law in the areas where there is divided jurisdiction as a result of High Court litigation in the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, there are very efficient and acceptable methods of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning about which there have been international conferences and which only in recent yearsindeed, over the past 18 months- have been developed to a point which makes them easily understood and acceptable to the people who are in most need of that type of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are methods which are now acceptable in the types of communities which have a perceived need for the type of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning education that is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my question which was praised by these people I pointed out that in a total points score of 50 <span class="highlight">family</span> unity is given only three points and is mixed up with a number of other factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in his question yesterday he mentioned <span class="highlight">family</span> unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three points are given in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> unity and six points in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Usually, the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion area scores additional points because there may be pre-arranged employment or economic support and a general viability that results from a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is that information transferred immediately to Canberra and is it available to the people who are sponsoring him such as a <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the application of a  Mr Van  Gameren of Portland in Western Australia to bring his brother-in-law,  Mr Mujeeb  Chowdary and <span class="highlight">family</span>, to Australia from India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following additional information received on this case, I recently carefully reconsidered  Mr Chowdary  ‘s application and I decided to approve the grant of resident status to him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> provided they meet normal health and character requirements and  Mr Chowdary  is able to obtain a firm offer of employment as a tradesman tanner or clicker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a rather frustrated mood, as one could well imagine,  Mr Chowdary  travelled over a thousand miles by train from Madras to Delhi with his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> to get to the Australian High Commission to see what could be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, applications were not resolved as the <span class="highlight">family</span> withdrew their requests . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Department suggested to the Minister, and the Minister signed the letter, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> withdrew their request for residence and asked for the return of their passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask him whether the Minister for Primary Industry informed him of the full nature of his financial interests and responsibilities which have now been discussed in the media and how long ago that Minister first informed him of the changes in shareholdings and directorships flowing from changed <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether she is aware that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of the Australian Capital Territory, which is funded by this Government, was supporting the setting up of a public abortion clinic when the issue was debated in this place last week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether abortion should be considered as a legitimate method of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, should not the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of the Australian Capital Territory condemn abortion rather than support its expansion and, indeed, concentrate its efforts on the necessary education of the community concerning the true <span class="highlight">family</span> planning methods of contraception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the first part of the question, may I say that the Minister was aware of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association’s support last week of the public abortion clinic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is of the opinion that the role of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association is in the dissemination of information on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and the provision of clinical services relating to acceptable methods of contraception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health does not regard abortion as a desirable method of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and does not support the action of the Association in seeking to exert influence on honourable senators in respect of the debate which occurred in this chamber last week on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that a housing duplex consisting of two threebedroom <span class="highlight">family</span> units has been purchased through the usual procedures of the Department of Administrative Services for use by staff employed at the office of the Department of Social Security at Kununurra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The price which was paid represented $72,500 for each of these two <span class="highlight">family</span> units and that price is in line with prices for comparable housing in the north-west of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say it is not a free pass because although the employee gets a pass for himself, his wife and children he then must pay $100 for each member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> plus the costs of the sleeping berths on the train and the costs of meals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well known that the Australian Government consistently has said that it places a very high priority on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From our economic analysis of the costs of work in the Northern Territory carried out by the aborigines, we believe that a total house suitable for a <span class="highlight">family</span> could be built for approximately $ 1 0,000.00 including the connection to services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was asked a question yesterday about what was alleged to be the Government’s intention to impose a <span class="highlight">family</span> means test for the payment of unemployment benefits to people under the age of 2 1 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no further comment to make on the subject except to state once again that the Government has no recommendation before it to introduce a means test on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis for payment of the unemployment benefit to persons under 2 1 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a question which I asked yesterday concerning <span class="highlight">family</span> means testing of unemployed people and to her subsequent answer at the end of Question Time in which she said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to assist  Senator Wriedt  yesterday, I was very frank in acknowledging to him that one of the options that was before the Government at Budget time was that a means test be imposed on <span class="highlight">family</span> income for the payment of benefits to those under the age of 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister contemplate establishing a judicial inquiry to report on the activities of these cults in Australia ensuring, firstly, that no intrusion into or harrassment of genuine and non-harmful groups by the inquiry is permitted and that true freedom to worship is not impaired in any way and, secondly, that the criteria of such an inquiry includes the following: Whether the sect requires from members compulsory financial contributions to the cult or its ‘spiritual’ leader; whether physical or mental damage is exerted or threatened to cult members or their families; whether undue influence is placed on <span class="highlight">family</span> structures to induce <span class="highlight">family</span> breakups; and any other associated matters which the Government in its wisdom considers appropriate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the emphasis on educational and employment qualifications is so great these days that any <span class="highlight">family</span> which can possibly keep young people at school and support them to the end of their schooling and then into post-secondary training or education does so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many poorer families in our community the small payment of $36, which is the payment for the youth unemployed, makes a significant difference to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although their expenses in seeking work can be just as high as those of people with dependants and although they may have fewer sources of <span class="highlight">family</span> support- they may have to pay rent alone instead of sharing, as some people in <span class="highlight">family</span> situations can do- the benefit paid to them will not be indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that <span class="highlight">family</span> of six people the income is reduced to $135.76 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, despite its rhetoric about equality of opportunity, concern for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and good intentions towards the public sector, demonstrates its bad faith in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard so much from the Fraser Government about its concern for families and its concern to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in those situations the one week that the father could take off to assist his <span class="highlight">family</span> was necessary and I dispute the claim of the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was necessary to the well being of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not wish our community in Canberra to suffer from all the social, <span class="highlight">family</span> and personal problems that arise when a young <span class="highlight">family</span> is without adequate support during difficult periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was perhaps traditionally the case- it was certainly the case in my own situation- that another member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> could assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that sort ot assistance is just not available to many Commonwealth employees, I do not think that it is ahead of community standards to say that a <span class="highlight">family</span> experiencing the birth of a new baby should have some assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these people have the responsibility of a young <span class="highlight">family</span>, mortgage commitments to meet and now greatly increased health insurance payments and everything else, they cannot possibly afford to give up a week without pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one that a government which is so keen on talking about support for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit ought not to be creating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that she must have had her tongue in her cheek when she was talking about a week’s paternity leave to allow the father to get to know his newborn child and at the same time look after the other children of the <span class="highlight">family</span> while the mother is in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the father cannot organise his holidays in that nine months so that he can have at least a week of his holidays shortly after his wife gets out of hospital or, if they already have a <span class="highlight">family</span>, he cannot organise his holidays so that he can look after the children while she is in hospital there is something radically wrong with the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, this Government has bad faith with the abusers of the system but it has not bad faith with the <span class="highlight">family</span>, with the women of this society or with the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they will encourage the woman who genuinely wants to stay in the Public Service and who wants also to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can he provide for himself if we tax him so that he cannot save, cannot house his <span class="highlight">family</span> and cannot provide for his sickness and his old age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the fundamental unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst governments have no place- within the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle, they have an obligation to encourage the <span class="highlight">family</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the striking exception of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme of this Government, very little has been done in a financial sense to encourage families to raise children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has not contributed to the stability of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My quarrel with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is that it provides no incentive to couples who are faced with the difficulties which all relationships experience to try to resolve those difficulties before separating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular I draw attention to the practice of tax avoidance through income splitting with <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must also consider carefully and ruthlessly the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as a method of tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they are gone, the only obvious reasons for <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts would be for income splitting as a method of tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, a recent decision of the Federal Court of Australia has held that partnerships may split incomes to assign incomes to <span class="highlight">family</span> members who are not effective members of the partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with Canada and New Zealand, Australia is one of the few countries to retain the system under which personal income tax is based on individual incomes and not on <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have to try again- possibly, heaven help us, through a new inquiry- to look at this single issue and to produce a solution to the problem of income splitting which does not involve lumping <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new inquiry should start from the premise that the chief purpose of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts is income tax avoidance, which certainly will be the case by the time it completes its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not my own personal view; it has been stated repeatedly by nuclear scientists in the United States who have pleaded with their Government to intervene and try to persuade the Marcos <span class="highlight">family</span>, which is dominating ownership and control of this reactor, to move the reactor to a safer area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article in the  Sunday Sun  of 22 October 1978 is not correct and there is no loss of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in the situation mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are payable in periods of 28 days and under the Social Services Act payment for a newly born child commences to accrue from the end of the endowment period during which the child is born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payments of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances therefore become due at the end of each endowment period but in order to avoid congestion at the banks one half of the mothers are paid a fortnight early (odd numbers) and the other half at the end of the period (even numbers). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Payment of unemployment benefit, sheltered employment allowance, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, double orphan’s pension, handicapped child’s allowance is not made to patients of mental hospitals as it is not possible for those persons to meet all the eligibility criteria associated with these payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances have not been increased since their introduction in the present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are really serious about talking of what has been promised and what has not been promised I should say that  Senator Grimes  made some note of the fact that supplementary assistance has not been increased and that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has not been indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one of the Opposition members would read what was said by  Mr Hayden  when presenting his alternative Budget- after all, we would have to accept that Budget as being party policy- we would see that other than the commitment for twice yearly increases and the indexation of unemployment benefits and, at that time the restoration of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which was later changed by the present Government, he made no commitments for further expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that in looking at social security we probably had to take a decision on whether to uphold our commitment to full tax indexation or whether to find $500m from the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in its wisdom and, I think, with the great support of the Australian people, decided to maintain the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I would agree with  Senator Grimes  when he says that pensioners, the people who are aged, invalid and sick, are the most vulnerable, I also need to recognise the needs of families- the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> with several small children, the <span class="highlight">family</span> with commitments to purchasing a house to give security to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the <span class="highlight">family</span> with a woman who is unable to work and who has commitments at home to her own children and a desire to be at home with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In determining our social welfare policy we went to organisations such as the Catholic <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Victorian Council of Social Service, various other social service councils around Australia, the society for the aging, the society for the crippled and pensioners associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has had children, anybody who has any imagination, realises that when there are young children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> the need for health care rises dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the amount of money which that woman has to stretch to feed her <span class="highlight">family</span> has been, of course, reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure takes no account of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which provides mothers with significantly higher benefits than the old child endowment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major and very familiar problem area is of course that of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, where, as is quite well known, the High Court has held in the case of Russell and Russell that there are constitutional inhibitions on the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court being able to deal with the full range of matters that can arise in matrimonial and particularly child custody cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their grandparents made application for custody to the Court exercising jurisdiction under the  <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act  1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court operating under the  <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act  1975 has no power to deal with their application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should have gone to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia which could deal with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, it is true that most of the kinds of problems to which I have referred, both in the context of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and in the earlier context of dual jurisdiction in trade practices and so on, could be coped with by less extreme measures, as  Senator Missen  indicates, than the integration of all Australian courts into a single centrally administered system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the <span class="highlight">family</span> law type situation could, as the honourable senator indicates, be solved by the State governments being much more willing than they hitherto have been to refer to the Commonwealth under the constitutional provision in section 51(xxxvii), the exercise of legislative power in respect of certain presently exclusive State matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That solution has been followed in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law context in Western Australia where the Federal Government has vested its jurisdiction in matrimonial matters in a State established <span class="highlight">family</span> law court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in Western Australia a situation in which all <span class="highlight">family</span> law and matrimonial matters can be dealt with by a single court and the New South Wales case to which I referred would not have turned out the way it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guidelines at the same time narrow the scope of services by limiting assistance in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction to urgent dissolutions and to real financial need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is prepared to see legal aid services used, say, in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction for cases of real need, for cases of urgent dissolution and for the more difficult matters, which he sets out in his statement, of custody, maintenance, access and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which I acknowledge has been the subject of many endeavours on both the Government and Opposition sides of the Parliament to make a more informal tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As procedures now stand it is still necessary for such an appearance to be made in all <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the situation to which I have been referring could be coped with by the further simplification of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court procedures of the kind that have been recommended by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission in its first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I hope that the Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which is considering the operation of that Act, will given urgent attention to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it is true that the staff of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts around the country are doing their best to provide that advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second element in the ministerial package is the requirement that a $100 court fee is to be paid by people who institute dissolution proceedings on their own behalf, with the qualification that a registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court can waive that fee on the basis of considerations of substantial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember who they are because under these guidelines the only people who are eligible for legal aid in the first place are, in the case of individuals, people whose net disposable incomes are a mere $52 a week or in the case of the ordinary average <span class="highlight">family</span> of four with a breadwinner and three dependants, where the total net disposable income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is $87. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth element in the package is the new cost scale for solicitors in <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court proceedings, which cost scale represents certainly a drastic downward revision of the fees payable to the private legal profession on matters referred to that profession by the Legal Aid Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These have come about as a result of a number of firms of solicitors now refusing to take on legal aid matters in <span class="highlight">family</span> law cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The firms that have been most conspicuous in this respect include some of the most specialised and expert firms in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area and firms which previously have handled quite a large bulk of the work load in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever one thinks of the attitudes of the firms in question- I offer no justification whatever for that kind of professional behaviour- the effect has been to place enormous additional pressures on the staffs of the Australian Legal Aid Office, both in the sense that they have had to do a great deal of extra work in trying to find firms willing to take on legal aid cases which, surprising as it may sound, I am informed has often proved difficult and lengthy, and in the even more obvious and significant sense as far as the staffs are concerned, has caused them to accept substantial additional burdens by way of the direct representation of legal aid clients in <span class="highlight">family</span> law cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfair to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and to his commitments elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of this debate there has been mention of the fact that there is, of course, a Parliamentary Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that that is one of the appropriate and hopeful areas because when one looks at the whole scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> law- which takes up something like 80 per cent of the legal aid costs in this country- one must realise that it is a very important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the application of legal aid at the <span class="highlight">family</span> court, only one of the courts in Australia has a legal aid service available at the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one would expect that legal aid must loom large in the investigation being made by a committee of the Parliament into <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case anyone thinks that the oil example is an isolated one, although I am sure everyone here knows that it is not, I will cite a second example- the handling of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had identified a problem with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practitioners do not use any non-prescribed drugs and a healthy married <span class="highlight">family</span> life is encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those terms there could be a lack of equity in comparison with those who are in full time employment and who have the same sort of <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as we are concerned our <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act contains an appropriate provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It removed the democratically elected government in Iran and installed one of the most barbaric dictatorships to be found anywhere in the world- the dictatorship of that cowardly cur, the Shah of Persia, a man who flew around in aeroplanes apparently with gold taps and gold baths; the man who, according to some reports, in conjunction with his <span class="highlight">family</span> has been able to ship $ 17,000m worth of assets out of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Thursday 8 February the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act held public hearings in Canberra, the principal witness appearing before it being the Department of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the concurrence of the Committee the  Chairman, Mr Ruddock,  wrote to the editors of the  Australian, Sydney Morning Herald  and the  Daily Telegraph  saying that the Committee was concerned to ensure that the public obtain a balanced view of the evidence being taken by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act Committee, and offered its cooperation in ensuring that this was possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number and type of complaints to the Federal Attorney-General’s Department about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are only a shadow of the real extent of public disquiet about this controversial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it would do well to speed up its review of the Act by the Federal Attorney-General ‘s Department and repeal the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act if it has, in fact, been a flop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless reporting of proceedings is fair and accurate the efforts of a committee such as the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to inform the public and facilitate intelligent debate on <span class="highlight">family</span> law will be frustrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this statement as  Deputy Chairman  of the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am ashamed to see the way in which the activities of the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and the evidence given to it have been distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the view, as I have often done in the past, that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is one of the great legislative achievements of this country in the last 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of the concern held by thousands of newsagents throughout New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory about a recently issued restrictive trade practices draft determination relating to their industry which, if implemented, will have very serious economic implications for them, particularly those who have sunk the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s life savings into the purchase of the business? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister see that all steps are taken to protect these small businesses which exist in every town, suburb and city of Australia and which, in the main, are <span class="highlight">family</span> concerns? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the Government has devised any revision of its <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy in regard to those Australian sponsors of Iranian origin who are seeking to bring relatives here who happen to be of nonMoslem belief and who are a bit apprehensive that the new Government will discriminate against those people who are not Moslems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are not just the unemployed, the parents of teenagers looking for work, one of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the breadwinner out of work or one of the growing number genuinely concerned that the danger lights are already flashing; the concern is widespread throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor should any <span class="highlight">family</span> be forced, by economic or other reasons, to have both partners of a marriage working in the paid work force if that is to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not consider the lifting of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the payment of a realistic homemakers allowance which would relieve the economic pressure and provide an opportunity for thousands of married women to leave the paid work force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that considerable recognition should be given to the woman who stays at home and looks after a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can compare those people with the man with a <span class="highlight">family</span> on the minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man with a <span class="highlight">family</span> on the minimum wage earns only $183 each week and pays tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill 1978 seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Durack),  in introducing this Bill and in a series of subsequent private discussions, has indicated that there are a number of amendments which might be regarded as being of a technical nature and which, in part at least, stem from the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major amendment, however, relates to the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies which was referred to in the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to promote, by the encouragement and co-ordination of research and other appropriate means, the identification of, and development of understanding of, the factors affecting marital and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia, with the object of promoting the protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit in society; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hopes that it will be able to play a positive role in developing an understanding of what makes for satisfactory <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships or, to use a somewhat tarnished expression, what makes for good marriages as distinct from bad ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that the principles underlying the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which seem to me to be sound should be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be more specific, there is a reference to the protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there are some reasons for querying whether we are stuck with the notion of the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> as the most natural and desirable group unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Institute should explore a great variety of factors which bear on the desirability of the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> which I think most historians and sociologists would say is a sort of bastard child of the industrial revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be desirable if in many of our policies relating to social issues more consideration were given to the situation which exists in more primitive societies than ours in which much more care and attention is given to the wider ramifications of <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships than in the typical Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> as it is sometimes described with a husband, a wife, two children and the television set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation and formulation of government policies- I make this comment irrespective of party lines- which bear on the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation are very much structured towards encouraging the continuance of the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> and against the possibility of encouraging wider and more supportive relationships in families which involve more than just a husband, a wife and two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is to be commended given the importance which must be attached to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that a number of senators have had the opportunity of visiting <span class="highlight">family</span> courts in their respective States or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the time of the introduction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill into the Senate and throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on the clauses of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, there was great concern and emphasis that the counselling procedures offered by the courts should be as informal and as adequate as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the criticisms and frictions which have arisen in relation to the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act have done so from difficulties over maintenance and custody matters which might have been resolved by counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that much of that criticism has developed into criticism of the substantive grounds under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act on which marriages are dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am concerned about is that the spirit of the original <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation should stand and that the more social aspects of the legislation and the aspects of the legislation which affects society as a whole should be constantly and more frequently examined in a constructive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that in years to come thousands upon thousands of Australians will benefit from the deliberations of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the amendments that are contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill 1978 and to welcome its introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the establishment and the powers of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council has met and, in its two annual reports, has made very substantial suggestions for amendments which, in the main, I think are useful to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are matters which may be of some controversy and they are, of course, also being considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which the Parliament set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot resist saying that the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies is a matter about which I have moaned in the Senate on many occasions now for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Institute ought to be operating contemporaneously with the development of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such research would be of inestimable value to the Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act because it is impossible for that Committee to carry out investigation which requires very detailed and considered research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other amendments contained in the Bill originated substantially but not entirely from recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note, for example, in regard to the matter of counselling, which is given emphasis in this Bill, that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council had this to say in its 1977 report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Counselling was regarded as a cornerstone in the unit operation which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The part of that report concerning <span class="highlight">family</span> law and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters is a most excellent document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the relatively small but useful amendments which this Bill provides will make the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court a more effective instrument than it has been already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with  Senator Button,  I believe that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has been responsible for very great achievements and that it has worked remarkably well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more that needs to be done, such as the matters which have been recognised by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and which I hope will soon come into legislative form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill’s major amendments affect the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies which was provided for in the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act at the time of its passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill 1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in a number of respects, notably by establishing the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill’s major amendments affect the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies which was provided for in the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act at the time of its passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest of the amendments are of a technical nature and do not substantially alter the spirit of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 116 of the Act, which establishes the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, is repealed (clause 19) and new provisions substituted by clause 1 8. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with a recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council, the Bill extends slightly the authority of courts to set aside or discharge property settlement or maintenance orders under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me accept  Senator Georges  ‘s reasons for entering into the debate, as I hope he will accept mine, and that is that, like others, I am very concerned about the effectiveness of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in the total building of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second instance I am privileged to be a member of the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a Bill relating to the Act, albeit only an amending Bill, comes before the Senate I like to indicate my stewardship in relation to that Committee as well as my interest in the wider ramifications of the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation within Australian society by involving myself, albeit in a general and brief way, in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite wise of us to have an amending Bill in relation to these issues because when we have a legislative act which impinges so much upon our community welfare, our social practices and indeed our <span class="highlight">family</span> lifestyle, it is good that there is a review from time to time in relation to detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recall very stongly the debate relating to the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in which there were a number of new initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of these amendments revolve around a matter which has been referred to by earlier speakers today, and that is the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies which has been set up as a national research and educational body and, as the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  said in his second reading speech it has an object which is to try to identify and disseminate information on negative and positive factors which affect <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, therefore, not surprising that the Government attaches great importance to the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies as does the Parliament and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our work with the Joint Select Committee there is obviously great interest in and great importance attached to the establishment of the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its principal function will be to promote, by encouragement and the co-ordination of research, the identification and understanding of the factors which affect marital life and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think the Attorney-General said in another context, the aim of the Institute will be to look at <span class="highlight">family</span> life to see- as he stressed- not what destroys but what makes a good marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will assume great social significance in the years to come because, as this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has been established within our community, and as the Committee which has been appointed by the Parliament to go into the Act brings in its report and its influence upon the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, so the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies will assume an even greater degree of importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he said, they fill in the blanks and streamline the terms and conditions and other matters which relate to the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a task which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has established, not only in the marriage guidance movement, but also for the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, to which I have already made reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wrong to suppose that the only aim of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was to make divorce easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the book  The <span class="highlight">Family</span> in Australia  the authors Krupinski and Yule in relation to counselling and consultation have this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the Bill, with its emphasis on a series of amendments, is an important development in the legislative processes that are going on in relation to the area of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The feature that is common to all of the amendments, including those that have been recommended by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and those concerning the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, around which so much of the Bill revolves, is that they are intended to facilitate the operation of the Act in the manner in which it was originally defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment also is necessary because of some deficiency found in the Act in regard to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assert, as a person who for some 10 years was director of the <span class="highlight">family</span> advertising agency, that we thought we were in business to increase markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then the Government has, amongst other things, refused benefit to claimants who failed the work test on the grounds of their appearance or their demeanour in the office; obliged single persons over 1 8 years of age to move from home if work is available elsewhere; deprived school leavers of unemployment benefit for six weeks after completion of their studies; tightened the restrictions whereby skilled persons were forced to accept unskilled work; required income statements to be delivered personally to the office of the Commonwealth Employment Service; required persons voluntarily leaving their jobs to wait six weeks before becoming eligible for benefit; changed the identification procedures so that no longer could identification be established by bank book or driving licence- the recipients must supply a birth certificate more than five years old, an insurance policy, a rates notice or other suitable documents; required that the failure of the CES work test would result in the cancellation of benefit whatever the <span class="highlight">family</span> or personal situation- in other words, the work test applied by the CES applied to the Department of Social Security no matter what other conditions applied; refused to accept post office addresses and terminated benefit if such an address was given despite the fact that many rural people travel from town to town; and refused payment of unemployment benefit to persons laid off during the Christmas-January shut-down in industries such as the motor vehicle industry even when they had no holiday pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change in the law will apply to trust income paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary on or after 12 June 1978 under tax avoidance schemes of the kinds mentioned and will not apply in the context of an agreement or arrangement that is entered into in the course of ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> or commercial dealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, relates to the closing in October last year of the child minding service associated with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the AttorneyGeneral agree that when <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation was debated in this chamber, heavy stress was laid on the need to remove the strains which had been associated with divorce jurisdiction in the past, with particular reference to the rights of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he had reports of unfortunate incidents in the precincts of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Brisbane since this child minding service has been closed down, particularly when children have come into contact with parents from whom they have been separated for some time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he considering the need for any action to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to take account of such a situation which could detrimentally affect the position of many women in the Australian community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the law applicable to a situation of this kind in Australia is, of course, not determined by the United States Supreme Court but by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act passed by this Parliament and interpreted by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia or ultimately the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was asked a question relating to a loan believed to have been made by the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission of Victoria, a six-figure loan made to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> and believed to have been $250,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has not done anything for the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> that it would not do for others similarly placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier, however, then went on to deny that he had any financial links with the Beggs or Fraser families and, in his own words, ‘links of any kind with the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>’, with whom he claimed not to be even acquainted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the immediate reaction, of course, as I assume the Premier intended, was a wave of sympathy for the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>: How could anyone be so cruel, it was implicitly argued, as to criticise the providing of a bit of financial assistance by way of cheap money to a poor Western District <span class="highlight">family</span> that had been burnt out of house and home by a natural disaster? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the whole story of the poor disadvantaged Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> who had been burnt out of house and home and had been given some compensation was blown apart by the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s  Nationwide  program on Thursday night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also revealed by the Prime Minister’s brother-in-law,  Mr Hugh  Beggs, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> had applied to the Victorian Rural Finance Commission for a loan about mid- June, some four months after the devastating fire swept through the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were also told that all the landholders contacted by the ABC, other than the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>, were satisfied with the settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We subsequently learnt that the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> had in fact received $180,000 from the SEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hugh  Beggs informed us via  Nationwide  that the loan obtained from the Rural Finance Commission had been used for what he termed as ‘restructuring the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s substantial debts’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the crucial fact which emerged from the  Nationwide  program was that the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> had been compensated by the SEC for its losses in the fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the article we were told that these investigative journalists had ferreted around State Government departments in Victoria and discovered from somewhere or other that the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> had suffered losses amounting to $300,000 in the fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a questionable figure but the important thing is that the ‘Insight’ team’s in depth investigation and its ferreting around in Victorian State Government departments failed to turn up the fact that the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> had received compensation of $185,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ironically, the evidence for all this has come mostly from the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have it again on the authority of Hugh Beggs on  Nationwide  last Thursday night that the money received from the Rural Finance Commission was used to restructure the substantial debts of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do all the farmers who have been knocked back by this and similar authorities in all States feel about a sum of $100,000 being given to the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">family</span> at concessional rates, apparently in breach of at least three provisions of the Schedule to the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western District farmer who received $2,000 was the only farmer in the Western District affected by that bushfire other than the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> who  Nationwide  could find who had received anything from the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">family</span> received $ 1 80,000 from the State Electricity Commission in Victoria in full compensation for the losses sustained in that fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that that loss was met by that Commission surely removes any just claim which the <span class="highlight">family</span> could otherwise have had for financial assistance from the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They pay 18 per cent or 20 per cent interest and the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">family</span> gets public money at 4 per cent and has the audacity to complain that it is ‘an unbelievable intrusion’ on their privacy when these facts are brought to light in the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the  Age  the Insight article failed to turn up the crucial fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> had been compensated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the other landholders in the Western District whom the ABC could contact last Thursday night agreed that the compensation had been fair and from the ABC’s researches only the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> claimed to have been dissatisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So without the pasture, at most, the losses sustained by the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the fire were of the order of $165,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to be claimed- I do not know whether it is- that this was disaster relief compensation, the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> in Victoria can get $100,000 apparently without any objections from the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  the Prime Minister or anyone else in the Liberal and National Country parties in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who will be most annoyed by this matter are the farmers who did not get the money, whether it was because they and the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> were not similarly placed I do not know, but they did not get the money and they will be annoyed about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has not done anything for the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> that it would not do for others similarly placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received no representations from anybody in relation to these loans, and the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>’s presentation of its affairs has been exemplary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt very much whether  Senator Walsh  would know the particular <span class="highlight">family</span>, farm or area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes the cost of the loss of fencing, very little funds would be left to the <span class="highlight">family</span> once the fences were replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows- perhaps Labor does notthat over the years some of the best <span class="highlight">family</span> farming concerns have had a very hard time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular transactions which give rise to the Opposition’s concern and this debate today are two loans of  $50,000  each, one at  4  per cent and the other at  10  per cent made on the same day in  1977  by the Victorian Rural Finance Commission to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Western District. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall summarise the questions which arise in respect of that matter: Firstly, conceding that there was substantial fire damage to the Beggs’ property in question in early  1977,  was the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> not sufficiently compensated for that damage by the  $180,000  compensation moneys which it received in the first instance from the insurance company, which moneys have been subsequently reimbursed to that insurance company by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria which has admitted liability? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, how does the  $50,000  which has been made available to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> for disaster relief, on top of that  $180,000  compensation which it has already received, compare with the sums that have been made available to other farmers in the area as a result of damage to a similar extent caused by the same fire? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they compare the  $50,000  handout that has been made to the Beggs-Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Western District with the money the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been able to obtain from the same agency, how can they be blamed if they suspect that something has gone haywire in the administration and supervision of this aspect of Commonwealth rural funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Victorian State Treasurer is  Mr Hamer,  whose financial connections with the Fraser-Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> are by now a matter of public record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this was the purpose for which the second $50,000 loan was being made- making a grand total of $100,000 being given to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> for disaster relief- how much stronger does that make the criticisms that I have already advanced about the doubts which surround the justice of and the justification for a loan being made at all to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>, given the $180,000 it received from the State Electricity Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Walsh  said, this was the kind of language employed by the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> spokesman in explaining to the world at large how it was the <span class="highlight">family</span> came to receive its loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we seriously to believe that this criterion was applicable to the Beggs-Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Western District, one of the biggest and best known land owners and graziers in that area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister was asked subsequently whether a loan had been made available to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> in Victoria under the flow through provisions of the scheme, he said that the matter had been determined by the Rural Finance Commission of Victoria according to its own judgment and in accordance with its own circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been only in the last week, when Government Ministers have begun to realise the implications of their own policy on death duties and probate duties and they have begun to realise the implications of their own rhetoric about tax avoidance, that we have begun to get a situation where the Prime Minister, for example, has said to the people of this country that schemes such as <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts are not appropriate for a person in the position of Prime Minister, or appropriate for a person in the Ministry of the present Government who is responsible for spending and directing the means of expenditure of Commonwealth money which is collected in the form of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is not concerned about the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen in the newspapers that members of the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> have described themselves as plain country folk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real point is not the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> itself but the circumstances in which Commonwealth money has been administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the situation as has been reported in a variety of radio and television programs, it can be seen quite clearly that the <span class="highlight">family</span> in question was an exception in that district which had suffered from bushfires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest, quite frankly, that some of the money which was paid to this <span class="highlight">family</span> was used to pay out a mortgage to a company called Ambulando Nominees, which is apparently a finance company carried on by a firm of solicitors in Melbourne in which  Mr Strachan,  one of the joint owners or tenants in common of the land in question, was in fact a partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As that is so, it seems that the people who received this loan, the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>, were clearly ineligible under the Rural Adjustment Scheme on at least two grounds, and perhaps three grounds if they received compensation from the State Electricity Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, having listened to the three speakers in this debate from the Opposition side I realise that it is quite obvious that this is purely a vehicle, by bringing the matter into the Federal ambit, for muck-raking for political purposes as far as a particular <span class="highlight">family</span> in Victoria is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then assumed that the <span class="highlight">family</span> did not need the loan and could pay it back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face it: A nation is like a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The breadwinner of a <span class="highlight">family</span> determines the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the breadwinner of this nation determines the standard of living of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain that despite the grandstanding by the Opposition today in order to bring attention to one <span class="highlight">family</span> in Victoria, the primary producers of this country will never forget what the Australian Labor Party did to them between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Voluntary organisations in the Territory- for example the Women’s Refuge, the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span> and the St Vincent de Paul Society- are strained well beyond their resources in trying to cope and give some assistance with the social problems which have followed upon the Fraser Government’s economic strategy for the national capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The then honourable member for Richmond,  Mr Anthony,  stated that few of the taxation measures ever introduced into the House had had a worthier object, that is, the provision of funds to supplement the income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases, trusts are required to hold assets in perpetuity where a <span class="highlight">family</span> has failed to organise its affairs many years ago and the trust is a vehicle for reorganisation and eventual dissolution of an estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has amply illustrated by his recent decision to dissolve his own <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, to retain his land holdings and to invest his funds in government securities, trusts are clearly not essential for the maintenance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm or other <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had an important <span class="highlight">family</span> engagement that evening and I had no intention of spoiling my plans because of a belligerent police officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have considered the position of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the Right Honourable Phillip Lynch, M.P., in the light of his disclosure to me of his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s financial interests and in particular, their interests in commercial arrangements entered into in September 1973 whilst he was in Opposition, and concluded in 1976 after he became Treasurer, concerning land at Balnarring in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the Melbourne Bar, who advised me that on the facts available to him from documents supplied and from information made available from Irish, Young and Outhwaite, and Mallesons, that nothing has been done by  Mr Lynch  or his <span class="highlight">family</span> which was illegal, commercially improper or represented a conflict between his or their private interests and  Mr Lynch  ‘s public duties as a Minister of the Crown, and that the arrangements were normal commercial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I very greatly regret the difficulty and anguish that Phillip Lynch and his <span class="highlight">family</span> have experienced over recent weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A far more satisfactory procedure must be found to resolve these situations which can have such an impact on an individual’s career and on the life of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I have heard- I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether I am correct- is that apart from a <span class="highlight">family</span> law judge in Sydney, the beneficiary of the judges’ pension Bill would have been the royal commissioner who presided over the royal commission into the McPherson electoral fiasco. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The treatment of a story on the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> and the Rural Finance Commission by the ABC radio program  AM  may be investigated by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications,  Mr Staley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1978 the Government decided upon certain proposed amendments to the Judges’ Pensions Act, which included a proposal that judges who had served at least five years but less than 10 years, which is the existing qualifying period, should receive a pro rata pension if their retirement was due to the constitutional requirement, which was passed by referendum, of compulsory retirement at 70 years of age for High Court judges and Federal Court judges or 65 years of age for <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware only two judges,  Mr Justice  McGregor of the Federal Court, and a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, will be affected by the amendments dealing with compulsory retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware the decision made by the Government in February 1978 applies to two judges, one in the Federal Court and one in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, and to no other judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of public statements that have been made recently with regard to the income of single parent families and the difficulties which they have in sustaining the <span class="highlight">family</span> on this income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the significant benefits which generally accrue to the individual from such education, the student and/or his <span class="highlight">family</span> should bear pan of these cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see why a person who undertakes tertiary education in circumstances in which there may be considerable poverty in the <span class="highlight">family</span> should receive less than his brother, for example, who is on the dole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A student’s income to that extent is almost continually eroded, apart from an increase, for example, in the last Budget which was set off by an adjustment to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of students living at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of students under the age of 25 years who, for a great variety of reasons, cannot live at home because of parental pressures or other problems in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 5- the student must verify his or her claim with a signed statement of the problems which exist at home and include not only a statutory declaration from two people but also a detailed floor plan of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts in this country ceased to request that sort of information four years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to be a serious anomaly which probably in many social and <span class="highlight">family</span> situations represents a considerable disincentive for students to apply for the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I put it to the Senate that in many cases, because of various matters relating to lifestyle, size of <span class="highlight">family</span> and things of that kind, it is not safe to make that sort of assumption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect, the gross income of a middle income <span class="highlight">family</span>, even after the <span class="highlight">family</span> adjustment, is certainly not a measure of its capacity to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister and the Senate that the Williams Committee recommended that the actual income tax paid should be deducted from the gross <span class="highlight">family</span> income in applying the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that is not the right measure, but it is different from taking into account only the gross income of a middle income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was left in some doubt as to precisely what he was saying but I do think that the level of the TEAS allowance does require some supplement to the income of students and that supplement will no doubt sometimes come from <span class="highlight">family</span> sources and sometimes come from the student’s own earning efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there was no increase in TEAS allowances last year, apart from the transfer of the $5.25 <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance from the parent to the student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means test for dependent students applied on the gross income of both parents with deductions allowed for actual income paid for one parent in the two-parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia wanted to further emphasise <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion while ‘maintaining a proper standard of selectivity,’  Mr MacKellar  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was not allowed to return for years and, finally, as a result of representations from our office, he was allowed to go back on the morning boat to see his <span class="highlight">family</span> for three or four hours but he was escorted by police back onto the boat and to the mainland in the afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Incidentally, the father of the <span class="highlight">family</span> had a $50 note in his licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> are former residents of Pensioners Reserve, due to the Ayr Council evacuating the area for the purpose of demolishing their homes for future development on that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Urgency for this <span class="highlight">family</span> to be adequately housed was supported with letters to the Department from myself, the Aboriginal health Team and Health Department of Ayr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I say ‘from the Australian Government’ I mean that since July 1976 some 480 letters of authority have been issued to residents of Vietnam who have immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people, as I have just mentioned, have immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it important that action be taken to encourage the Vietnamese authorities to act in a humane way and to enable these <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been vetted by Australia, they have been provided with Australian Government letters of authority and they should not be subjected to the elaborate procrastination that has occurred and the consequent anxiety which has been caused between parents and children, between husband and wife, and between one <span class="highlight">family</span> and another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this morning’s edition of the Melbourne  Age  I noticed a statement by the  Deputy  High Commissioner for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees,  Mr Dale  de Haan, who said that Vietnam had told him that it will reduce the number of boat people leaving its shores if other countries take Vietnamese refugees on a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the issue has been overtaken by the announcement of the Federal Government in January of this year concerning the cutting off of aid and the recent announcement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees concerning the apparent indication by the Vietnamese Government on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to make it perfectly clear, and  Mr Lynch  has made it perfectly clear, that he has no interest in a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> trust does not concern his own assets but those of his wife and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are looking at this then let us have the <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts of the Labor Party exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A declaration of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts has been made by every Labor member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the  Deputy  Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party does not utilise <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts for the purposes of taxation dodging, the existence of a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust has been published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if  Mr Lynch  received no benefit from the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, it was established for taxation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rejection of parental standards leads to an equal rejection of <span class="highlight">family</span> serials, but the strain experienced in managing such an identity results not only in a compulsion to view lone heroes, even though each episode is self-contained, but also in fairly frequent loss of identity when attending to a variety of media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The local government legislation provides no security for outstations where Aboriginal clan and <span class="highlight">family</span> groups have moved away from the government controlled settlements to establish a better economic base and greater independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-In the course of his remarks in the urgency debate today,  Senator Carrick  repeated a challenge made to me towards the end of the last session to define the difference between bona fide <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and those which I would regard as tax dodging arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One class of <span class="highlight">family</span> trust with which I would have no quarrel is that of testamentary trusts, those which come into operation on a testator’s death and are designed simply as a convenient means of administering the estate, in particular and most commonly as a vehicle for the keeping of <span class="highlight">family</span> property together for the lifetime of the surviving spouse while still allowing the possibility of ultimate and equitable distribution among the testator’s children or whoever else he wants to benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most popular way of setting up a trust these days, particularly in the <span class="highlight">family</span> context, is to use the flexible discretionary trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that certain trust arrangements and certain circumstances, particularly simple fixed trusts, can be a means for public figures to dissociate themselves from <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses, either for reasons of propriety or perhaps for reasons of a simple lack of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about every single kind of inter vivos trust arrangement which is used today, and certainly every kind of <span class="highlight">family</span> trust arrangement, is that, as the law now stands, they can operate and do operate in practice to confer very significant tax advantages on their users. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the dismantling of these kinds of taxes destroys any real rationale that may be claimed for trusts in terms of keeping together <span class="highlight">family</span> farms and businesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third most obvious tax advantage of trust arrangements is in the case of the <span class="highlight">family</span> business situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The example was as follows: Assume a <span class="highlight">family</span> of father, mother and three children, with the business having a net income of $40,000 before deducting the proprietor’s wages, and then consider the following changes which can be rung upon that scenario. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You would have to be a real mug- perhaps even a socialist mug- not to set up a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s argument is not against trusts or even <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative and quite different way that might be suggested- and was specifically suggested in the Asprey report in the specific context of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts- is to tax the income of the minor beneficiaries at a rate which takes account of the parents’ income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts are to be defended by the legitimate purposes they can perhaps serve in marginal cases, those who use them should be willing to go on doing so even if the tax advantages now associated with them are stripped away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suspect that it is then that the true extent of the humbug that is so often talked in defence of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts will be starkly revealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he recalls my asking him approximately a month ago a question in relation to the provision of child minding facilities at the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I wish to add to an answer to a question that  Senator Martin  asked me earlier today about the closure of a child minding centre at the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the child minding service at the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Brisbane was withdrawn at the end of November 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was raised, of course, in the context- if  Senator Carrick  has already forgotten it-of the $100,000 loans given to the Beggs-Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span> through the auspices of the Victorian Rural Finance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the conditions of approval attached to Community Health Program grants to national projects such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program, the recipient organisation is required, each year, to provide my Department with a statement of income and expenditure and a balance sheet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objectives of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program, as described below, are such that it is impracticable to apply cost-effectiveness measures, as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When approving the 1978-79 grant for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program, I also approved an overall review of the Program, commencing with a review of the reorientation sub-program, which is directed towards objective (b) outlined in part (4) of my reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review of the reorientation sub-program is well under way and review of other aspects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program has commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The initial grant to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program in 1 973-74, and the grants in the following four financial years, were approved on the recommendation of the former Hospitals and Health Services Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>b) to provide an opportunity for more mature graduates (mainly women) to enter or re-enter the practice of <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to encourage medical graduates to practise <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine in areas which were under-served by <span class="highlight">family</span> practitioners and thus to improve the distribution of <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine services; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>) to up-grade the standard of <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine by providing post-graduate vocational training in that branch of medical practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the funding of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program was commenced on the basis that it was desirable to pursue the achievement of these objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program is basically a program of post-graduate vocational training in <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine as a particular branch of medical practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask, and in doing so I expressly exclude visits by Her Majesty the Queen of Australia or Prince Phillip or Prince Charles: What has been the total cost of the parasitical wanderings of other members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> to and within Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I can fully understand that a Labor Party which considered that its royalty lay in its disastrous former Prime Minister would not want to expend as much on the Australian Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> as it did on him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, a little research will show that the wanderings of the erstwhile Prime Minister, particularly when looking at Grecian ruins, were far less productive than have been the very hardworking efforts of the individual members of the British Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>, including Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: Those who know of the sheer hard work of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> will reject out of hand the criticism he is making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It rejects the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>, preferring the psuedoroyalty it created for itself amongst the Grecian and Australian ruins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probate duty within the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been abolished, and the Premier has promised to abolish the duty completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier is aiming to remove land tax altogether from the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He wants to double the per capita grant for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and community services program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is envisaged that this program will take over from where the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance program left off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, accepting that what  Senator Walters  says is a true reflection of the statement, I would commend any appeal to employers to allow students to undertake sufficient part time work to enable them to sustain themselves, particularly as a supplement either to their <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes or to their Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be placed in the bedroom or loungeroom of a home and the domestic outpourings of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit would become the subject of some scrutiny by the Director-General and/or his agents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that the use of such devices should be curtailed so that the rights of all people, whether they are part of an organisation or <span class="highlight">family</span> or are present at a meeting place, are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be something that can be done for my <span class="highlight">family</span> and I beg of you out of humanity and compassion to bring this matter to the senate and have the Social Security act reviewed and to approach the Minister for Social Security  Senator Margaret  Guilfoyle to show some compassion for my children ‘s sake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 9 May 1979 of the Right Honourable  Sir Charles  Frederick Adermann, K..B.E., a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Maranoa from 1943 to 1949 and for the division of Fisher from 1949 to 1972,  Chairman  of Committees from 1950 to 1958 and a Minister of the Crown from 1958 to 1967, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that all honourable senators will join me in extending sympathy to  Sir Charles’s  widow and to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and, of course, to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I extend sincere sympathy to Lady Adermann and her <span class="highlight">family</span> in their time of grief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of this amount, more than 80 per cent will be spent on income security payments, that is, pensions and benefits; about 15 per cent will be spent on allowances, mainly <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; the rest will be spent on administration and programs for the handicapped, the aged and the homeless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are also under attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Statements have been made in the other House about the need to reduce <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances, as every mother in the community has noted, are worth considerably less than when they were introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are a recognition that it costs money to raise children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably you could take the opportunity to clarify the paper that I understand you are circulating on proposals on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, some papers have been prepared that would change the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About two million people receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of what  Senator Grimes  said about the need to index the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and to maintain the benefit for the universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, I think that some clarification of the paper circulated by him, which may change by $1 a week the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance paid to families on high incomes, is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to argue with respect to future security for those who receive either the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance or the benefit under the over 70 pension scheme, I think some clarification from the Australian Labor Party on its own policies would be beneficial if we are to have a rational discussion and debate on income security matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was a Liberal government that set the pace, as was the case with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; it was a Liberal government that introduced <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate calls on the Government to introduce sixmonthly indexation of repatriation and social security benefits, in particular, pensions and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to ensure that this Senate had the opportunity of debating and voting on this very important matter relating to indexation of repatriation and social security benefits, including pensions and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, before the Government formulated the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My notice of motion simply calls upon the Government, before it formulates the Budget, to take note of the fact that the Senate is of the opinion that it should introduce six-monthly indexation of repatriation and social security benefits and in particular pensions and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the most significant of these areas are: Commercial law generally; defamation law and other laws affecting the media; <span class="highlight">family</span> lawoutside Commonwealth jurisdiction- and other laws affecting personal status; and road traffic, carrier’s and innkeeper’s liability and other laws affecting travel and tourism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing with the way in which the AttorneyGeneral is going to have to focus his mind upon a series of conditions which have to be met, such as those proposed by sub-clause 2 (a) and (b) of the Opposition amendment, I notice that, whilst it refers to an action that allegedly endangers the physical safety of the officer, employee or agent, it does not say anything about the right of privacy of the officer, employee or agent and it does not say anything about the physical safety of the members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, which I would have thought would have been a reasonable thing to include if one were concerned to afford real protection not only to the individuals concerned but also to the people who are dependent upon them, such as members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> and other people who may live at the published address of the alleged ASIO agent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Visits by the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Funds being appropriated in relation to visits during the current financial year by other members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> are detailed in the Appropriation Bill No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That does not take into account the social costs that the <span class="highlight">family</span> will have to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators who seem to find this a surprising idea that a <span class="highlight">family</span> on an average income, with three or four children, going through a period of illness, will find having to pay for every visit to the general practitioner or every referral to a specialist, an intolerable burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that everyone on this side of the House represents constituents who may do all right under this system just announced until such time as illness occurs in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no person on a low or medium income who can, without receiving medical benefits, stand up to the financial pressure when sickness occurs in the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are about 42 <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges throughout Australia, 30 Federal Court judges, and the  President  and commissioners of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said, during a 2SM broadcast last night that it would be unjust if the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the sick and the aged were chosen as victims of reduction in Government benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quoting the Australian Government Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, the Cardinal said that <span class="highlight">family</span> life could be harmed by the stress and restricted opportunities created by low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should work together to create a nation in which the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are always our prime concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another omission which is the cause of great concern is the failure of the Government to do anything at all in the mini-Budget in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no indexing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances since they were increased and no attempt to compensate families for the loss of income which resulted from the abolition of the rebate scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply draw the attention of the Senate again to figures which show that as at the end of the last financial year the following losses have been incurred by families as a result of the failure of the Government to index or increase the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment: For a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child the loss has been $3.50 a week, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children, $8.50 a week; for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children, $ 14.50; for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children with one student child, $14.50; and for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children with two student children, $ 14.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that by the changeover to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system, which initially was of benefit to families, this has now become another area in which families are failing to keep up with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side know that the effects of maintaining such high levels of taxation on the average <span class="highlight">family</span> will be catastrophic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan referred to the lack of indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that there has been no increase in the rates that have been given to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments, but $ 1,000m is spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in this country and a factor that is not recognised is that in the 1976 Budget this Government replaced the Hayden tax rebates for children and child endowment with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, and this initiative brought greatly increased assistance to some 300,000 families with 800,000 children who did not benefit from the Hayden scheme of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That additional number of the lowest income people who were not able to have the advantage of tax rebates-300,000 families and 800,000 children- are now receiving substantial <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, whereas they were unable to take advantage of the tax rebates because of the level of their income in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to talk about policies, perhaps the only document which we could relate to the debate of today, where we are charged with withdrawing social security and health services, is the Hayden alternative budget presented at the time of the Budget last year in which we saw that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would not be indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  made some reference to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in his speech, but when he put down figures to show that he too was economically responsible, he was careful to make no allowance to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 know it is good for the Government if it can increase the infant mortality rate, because it will reduce the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments that have to be made and this will save money for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That might seem a hard thing to say, but the Government saved a considerable amount of money last year by not having to pay <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for Aboriginal kids who died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to elaborate slightly on a question I asked a fortnight ago in this chamber concerning visits of certain members of the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one has an hereditary head of state, one is really saying that access to decent living conditions, proper health care and a stimulating and full education for one’s children, depends on the <span class="highlight">family</span> into which one is born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, in Australia we believe that everyone, into whatever <span class="highlight">family</span> he or she is born, ought to be given a fair go with access to living conditions of a decent standard, adequate health care and proper education, without regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> ancestry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constantly, it would seem, we are being required to foot the bill for the travels of a much wider selection of the remnants of Queen Victoria’s <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was a vivacious girl who by her own effort and talent- not by virtue of the <span class="highlight">family</span> into which she was born- had put herself in a position where she was working her heart out on behalf of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Angus Ogilvy, members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>, who visited Australia for some 13 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a somewhat different way, it is pleasant to see the Queen and some of her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What am I to say to a <span class="highlight">family</span> man who faces an extra $3.50 a week for health insurance costs as a result of last Thursday’s mini-Budget’s breaking the Medibank promise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excluding the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles, who have a constitutional role to perform, the continued subservience of this Government to other members of the royal <span class="highlight">family</span> symbolises its total loss of touch with the vast majority of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A national <span class="highlight">family</span> survey conducted by the University of New South Wales has shown that nearly 320,000 children live in one-parent families, which families make up over 9 per cent of the nation’s families and a great majority of these children are dependent on parents who receive social security pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the latter is the case how does the Government justify discrimination against the <span class="highlight">family</span> where the wife and not the husband is the invalid pensioner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be understood that invalid pensions are tested on a <span class="highlight">family</span> income basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may have been turned away from two or three refuges or perhaps even four or five because when a woman is in a crisis situation all she is intent on doing is finding accommodation for herself and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it takes a great deal of courage for women with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities suddenly to walk out of the matrimonial home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in interest rates that has occurred- even though the Government said that it would reduce them- has meant that housing has become dearer, that people are more in need of second mortgages, more in need of two incomes in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He handed out <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to wives as he took extra money from the pockets of their husbands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now it also applies to 42 <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges, 30 Federal Court of Australia judges and the  President  and commissioners of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Miss Allebi arrived in the United Kingdom in January 1975 with her son and daughter having fled from the aftermath of the 1973 Chilean coup d’etat to Lima, Peru, where she and her <span class="highlight">family</span> received protection from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She and her <span class="highlight">family</span> on arrival in the UK were received and resettled by the Joint Working Group for Refugees from Latin America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The coup in Chile forced her to abandon her <span class="highlight">family</span>, friends and job; many friends were killed in the aftermath of the coup or simply disappeared ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Miss Allebi s <span class="highlight">family</span> are resident in Australia- her widowed mother, two brothers and sister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While bearing in mind that Miss Allebi ‘s case would probably not come under the categories currently eligible for permanent entry to Australia I trust that you can regard her case with humanitarian sympathy to enable her to re-unite with her <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of projects within the Office of Child Care are designed to prevent child abuse and many of them come under the <span class="highlight">family</span> services support programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People are accepted on the basis of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion or job category or because they are political refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her  relationship with <span class="highlight">family</span> members residing in Australia would not seem to bring her within the categories eligible for admission on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am able to advise him that migration to Australia from Peking is governed by a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion agreement between the governments of Australia and the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only persons coming within the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion categories are therefore eligible to emigrate from Peking or other parts of China to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are therefore more seriously affected than is the average <span class="highlight">family</span>, and their nutrition standard must suffer accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say is that it must be a long time since  Mr Lynch  tried to live off the dole if he thinks that anybody would try to support a wife and bring up a <span class="highlight">family</span> on the sort of money unemployed people are paid these days, with the costs they have to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-It is very clear that the Fraser Government’s policies are based on assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance programs, of course, are monumental in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>They transfer public income to the mother of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in a very significant way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the Senate to consider a comparison of the income of $120 a week with the income of $103 of a man with the same <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities who is on the dole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She must decide whether to keep her job and to move to another area- thus breaking up her <span class="highlight">family</span> and perhaps her relationship with her husband- or whether the husband has to give up his job and find another job in the area to which his wife has been redeployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment a single person will pay $1 or $1.20 depending with which organisation he registers and a <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay $2 or $2.20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, a <span class="highlight">family</span> which wishes to have the basic health care does not have to pay $12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But the <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay about- we do not know the amount yet-$1.50 to $3.00 for health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The legislation that is before us is a further blow to families, particularly to the single low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These families and families as a whole have been reeling from the lack of attention given to them and from the failure of the Government to restore the value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which, as a result of cost increases, have been eroded by 32 per cent since they were introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Unless the Government takes urgent action to do what it said it would do, that is, support the <span class="highlight">family</span>, I certainly will be viewing my position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I listened carefully to the last  speaker, Senator Harradine,  and I assure him that many of his colleagues in the Senate understand and share his concern for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, for its place, and for the stresses under which families are operating more and more in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to point out that the former Government’s policy of providing 75 per cent cost of salaries of agreed staff in pre-schools, provided they confirm that they extend and integrate their activities to cover other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> need, will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  says that Australia wants to protect the social and economic future of all its citizens and that therefore it has to limit the number of migrants it accepts each year and give preference to those with close <span class="highlight">family</span> ties, and with skills, professional qualifications or experience that are in strong demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that a woman who recently went back to the United Kingdom with her five children because she said she could not stand Australia has been backwards and forwards two or three times, it is interesting to note that authorities in Britain said that Australia House was very helpful in arranging for her and her <span class="highlight">family</span> to be repatriated back to Australia when they had gone home to England before and then had wanted to return to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 8 May 1979  (Hansard,  page 1672)  Senator Sibraa  asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the possibility of introducing a moratorium on home loan repayments where the major income earner of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it should be noted that if the criterion were solely whether the income-earner of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit were unemployed that would not take into account the overall income position of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and hence not necessarily be closely related to the extent of any need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A criterion based on <span class="highlight">family</span> unit income would be difficult, if not impossible, to administer and would lead to anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that recently one judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court resigned to go back to his practice at the bar, but I think that, generally speaking, the argument about mobility in the labour force generally has little application to the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She has accommodation for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and is prepared to accept responsibility for all six members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal put forward by the sponsor, was, firstly, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> should come to Australia to be accommodated by the daughter in her own home; secondly, that the mother and the elder child could give assistance in the home and perhaps in the business; thirdly, that the father could make whatever contribution was appropriate for his age; and, fourthly, that the younger children should attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the <span class="highlight">family</span> would be reunited, as is its wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Timor would be allowed to leave that country, which again is their wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to dwell on this because I think that honourable senators would understand the attitude of people who would want to contribute and who would not want to be- as they might regard- parasitical on their <span class="highlight">family</span>, although of course the <span class="highlight">family</span> would not see this in any sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another advantage would be that it would avoid the possibility of the <span class="highlight">family</span> being stranded if the elderly father should pass away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another advantage would be that the money that is being sent to Timor to sustain the <span class="highlight">family</span> would stay in Australia and would be spent in Australia and build up consumer spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply ask the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  to investigate the special case of the wife as the bread winner, as represented by the Tchia <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be two alternatives: The Minister either can use his discretion and allow the <span class="highlight">family</span> in or, perhaps more appropriately, may wish to rule on this matter and to fill out the present guidelines to cover similar cases in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Are these great differences a mistake on the part of the Government, or are they a deliberate attempt to destroy the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure in our society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the recent horrendous bombings by an extreme fanatical and lunatic terrorist group which cost the lives of Earl Mountbatten of Burma and immediate members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, as well as the lives of 19 British soldiers, and also in view of a general upsurge in similar violent actions by this and other similar terrorist elements throughout the world, will the Minister inform this chamber as to the present position with regard to the training of the Australian antiterrorist squad? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Bonner rightly draws attention to the anguish of all decentthinking people in the world as a result of acts of terrorism against not only the Mountbatten <span class="highlight">family</span> but also soldiers and others, and to the growth of terrorism around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He described the Budget as anti-<span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures reflect, of course, the changeover to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, which was introduced in 1976 by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party apparently has never liked the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I note that  Mr Hayden  ‘s alternative Budget of last year, wherein he made a detailed effort to show what he would introduce as a program, no account was taken of the requirement to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could hardly suggest that, in his speech last night, he made any commitment to increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Senator Grimes  is on record as saying that the high cost of increasing payments to the 4.3 million children who are the subject of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances represents an inhibiting effect on any desire by the present Federal Government to increase them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sheer hypocrisy for the Australian Labor Party to make such statements and adopt such a posture concerning the non-indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances by this Government in view of what is said in a paper that has been released by  Senator Grimes  concerning an alternative to the present universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a paper that calls for a reform of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme provides for the payment of a universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to every child in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, every child in Australia receives the same benefit regardless of his <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowances, which replaced the old system of child endowment and taxation rebates for children, present a means whereby a start can be made to give a more equitable distribution of public monies to benefit those in need, while more basic changes in other areas are sorted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowances are paid at the same level to the most wealthy and poor families has been the subject of question and debate since they were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let honourable senators opposite tell that to the people who receive the universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggested modifications would result in a system with the following features- retention of the present non-income-tested payments paid as at present, at either a reduced rate or at the same rates if economic conditions allow; the introduction of a yearly payment in the form of a tax credit or a direct payment if desired, based on a <span class="highlight">family</span> income test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was considered desirable not to add to government spending, a reduction in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowance could pay for the increased supplement paid to lower income groups, e.g a reduction of $4 per month per child would have resulted in approximately $200,000,000 in 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not an anti-<span class="highlight">family</span> policy to the children of Australia who are receiving benefits under the universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that I have had the opportunity to say something about the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance policy or proposals of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 million people who receive these <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances on behalf of 4.3 million children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably worth noting too that  Mr Hayden  was less than accurate in implying in his speech that the real levels of payment to disadvantaged <span class="highlight">family</span> units were maintained by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he did not care to mention that when he was talking about a anti-<span class="highlight">family</span> approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the response that he is talking about is the redistribution of the $200m from the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme that was mentioned at the conclusion of the quote that I made from the paper of  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his response is to abandon the universal <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, let us hear that from him so that the people can judge which payment they prefer to receive on behalf of the children of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should be of great assistance, particularly to those children who are suffering from chronic or repeated illnesses in relation to which the burden of cost on the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a very grave one indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has doubled the assistance given to those families where children’s services are vital and where <span class="highlight">family</span> support services are required for the strength of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many anti-<span class="highlight">family</span> aspects of the Labor Party program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have the sorts of statements made by  Mr Hayden  with regard to anti-<span class="highlight">family</span> programs and to neglect to appreciate the effect of inflation on the security of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a significant omission from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1979 in Australia it does not do to be old, to be sick, to be unemployed, to be a school-leaver or to be a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in this country at the moment one is unemployed, married and has a <span class="highlight">family</span> one has to keep that <span class="highlight">family</span> on less than $ 100 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone is unemployed, married and has a young <span class="highlight">family</span> he is facing an enormous increase in doctors’ fees which he cannot afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, a person with a young <span class="highlight">family</span> finds that costs are rising, unemployment is growing and wages are going down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  spoke glowingly about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which were going to give women freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances have not been increased since 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It replaced them with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which have not been increased since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for this Government’s care for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She talked about the magnificent moves this Government had made in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, what she did not go on to tell the people was that with the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances the taxpayer can no longer claim children as a tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mothers have been in tears because Dad had cut from the weekly house keeping money the extra money that they received in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in effect what the Government gave Mum by way of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, Dad took away to pay the accounts that he had to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In lots of cases they are much worse off under this <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that  Mr Gordon  and  Mr Gyngell  have had a long-standing personal association and that  Mr Gyngell,  at the 4 June meeting of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, notified the Tribunal that he would not participate in the inquiry into the WIN4 share transaction because it involved Oberon Broadcasters Pty Ltd in which  Mr Gordon  and his <span class="highlight">family</span> were the chief beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the public inquiry the Tribunal sought information about  Mr Gordon’s  personal, <span class="highlight">family</span> and business interests and associations both in Australia and the United States, with particular attention given to  Mr Gordon  ‘s contract with Paramount Pictures which expires in September 1 98 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance, the Tribunal was given a great deal of precise information about  Mr Murdoch’s  personal, <span class="highlight">family</span> and business life in this country and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the shares in the licensee company are held by members of the Gleeson <span class="highlight">family</span>, with  Mr F.  J. Gleeson holding 50.1% and the remainder being held by his wife,  Mrs Joyce  Gleeson and in various <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sale of 2HD by the NSW Labor Party to NBN-3, dominated by the local Wansey and Lamb <span class="highlight">family</span> interests, would give Newcastle the most concentrated media ownership of any major city in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not have referred to the matter but for the furore that was created when two Labor Ministers- I think on only two occasions- saw fit to take a member of their <span class="highlight">family</span> with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, the upshot was that they had to pay the fares of those <span class="highlight">family</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we turn to page 69 of this document we see a reference to the matter which I mentioned a while ago about the member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also affect the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>, particularly the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> and the large families with children who frequently get ill and who frequently need prescriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should remember that the allowances for pensioners’ children have not been increased since 1975, despite inflation, and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have not been increased since 1976, despite inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of <span class="highlight">family</span> health insurance has risen to $6.77 and $7.10. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment that cover costs between $2.68 and $2.92 for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of current deficiencies in the Budget discriminate against people who are unemployed, people who have young children and who depend upon allowances for children, and people who depend on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances have remained unchanged, as have children’s allowances and the supplementary assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the patient feels sick and feels that he needs the drugs, he or a member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> could go and get a repeat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take it that there has been no real objection today to Australians who have an adequate income, who have an intact <span class="highlight">family</span>, who are not in need and who are not special cases, paying the extra 25c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a <span class="highlight">family</span> cover for 75 per cent of doctors’ fees she quoted a cost of between $2.68 and $2.92; and for the same cover- 75 per cent of the doctors’ fees- for a single person she said it was between $1.34 and $1.46. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On  Senator Walters’  figures, a <span class="highlight">family</span> will have to pay $2.68 for cover by a health fund, $10 for its share of each visit to the doctor and $5.50 to fill two prescriptions, which is the average these days after a visit to the doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that a <span class="highlight">family</span> will be paying about $ 1 8. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wondered, in passing, whether the Government had done any costbenefit study on what increases would occur in the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances resulting from the contraceptive pill being removed from the pharmaceutical benefits list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask that, before the Government takes that action and removes the contraceptive pill from the list, it conducts a costbenefit study as to how much more it will pay out in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances if that happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be seen in this report, for instance, that some attention is given to a particular example involving a matter of the law as it relates to families in which a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court was able to draw attention to the fact that the operation of the law as it was, and even the operation of the law as it had been updated by the passage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, nevertheless had brought about a situation which, from the community’s point of view, was entirely unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Neither the Supreme Court of New South Wales nor the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court had the sort of jurisdiction that one would have expected after nearly 80 years of federal law affecting <span class="highlight">family</span> matters and <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships and which should have been solved long before this date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The teaching of this cult is that if anything interferes with the cultist’s spiritual activities he must dissociate himself from that interference, which in this case obviously would mean that this lady would have to leave her husband and <span class="highlight">family</span>, all of whom happen to love her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are not going to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, if we are not going to index allowances for children of pensioners, if supplementary allowances are not going to be indexed, it is people like this, people who find it very hard to get by who are going to be the ones to suffer; people who tell us that they have two kiddies- both of secondary school age, by the look of it- and they sat down on Monday and Tuesday nights to have their dinner of 40c worth of bread and chips. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The different levels of unemployment benefit take into account <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, the age or other responsibilities which may apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, I want to look at the question of what it means, after five years of Fraser Government, not only for unemployed people and the ordinary Australian wage earner but more particularly for the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that the changes in the lowering of the value of the average <span class="highlight">family</span> income in this country have been accompanied by, in the last year or so, greatly increased profits in the corporate sector amongst larger companies and a relative erosion of earnings of skilled manpower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, I point out that, as the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> is being burdened with additional health charges, there have been steadily and rapidly rising incomes for members of the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In talking about an incomes policy in a country such as this, as I said before, the Government cannot on the one hand charge ordinary people more for health insurance, attempt to reduce real wages constantly, and reduce <span class="highlight">family</span> income standards, and at the same time have insufficient guts as a government to stand up to a system which allows these sorts of incomes to be made without any firm hand or direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It changed the whole structure of child endowment and introduced a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance concept that brought about the greatest transfer of real wealth from the affluent to the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have brought in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, an heroic change in concept, in order to transfer wealth to the mothers of the lowest income families and the largest families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Labor Party, the Fraser Government’s record in terms of the ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> is unchallenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continual decline in the real value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is another product of the Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the secondary distribution of income- that is, net after taxation and after accounting for transfer payments including <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and so on- we find that there has been a very substantial and regressive alteration in the secondary distribution of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at some specific examples of the effect of the Government ‘s 1 979 Budget taxation policy as against that for the previous year we find that over the year a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $160 a week pays 28 per cent more tax and a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $240 per week pays 16 per cent more tax but someone on the Prime Minister’s salary of $1,600 a week pays only 10 per cent more tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They show that 6 per cent of the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income is spent on petrol, oils and lubricants; for the middle income <span class="highlight">family</span> the figure is 3 per cent; and for the high income <span class="highlight">family</span>, only 1  Vi  per cent is spent on those commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the distribution of <span class="highlight">family</span> income in Australia, we find that the bottom 10 per cent of income earning families receive only 2.2 per cent of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The top 10 per cent of income earning families earns 23 per cent of income- almost exactly 10 times as much per <span class="highlight">family</span> as those families in the low income group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Chairman  recently returned from a study tour of Europe and North America, during which he gathered substantial data on <span class="highlight">family</span> law systems in other countries with comparable jurisdictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These meetings will cover topics where difficulties have been identified, such as the position of children under the Act, custody, maintenance, property and the organisation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at what is happening to the small people, to the <span class="highlight">family</span> which is part of the union system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These thousands of people on below average weekly wage, to use the term, along with <span class="highlight">family</span> households and businessmen and women, are being penalised while the oil, coal and mineral exploiters of our country generally continue to be allowed a free hand as they slip their dividends from many areas to tax-free havens around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of these, 402,800 were not looking for work because of personal or <span class="highlight">family</span> considerations, and 63,400 were discouraged job seekers, that is, they wanted a job but were not looking for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All children without any exception whatsoever shall be entitled to these rights, without distinction or discrimination on account of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, whether of himself or of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Luckily, medical research has indicated to us various criteria, which I will not detail but which can indicate to the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, to a social worker or perhaps to the principal of a school that a child is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What can the community do to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise both parts of that sentence: What can the community do to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object must always be to maintain that <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, however fragile, however desperately close it may be to breaking up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may require removing the child from the <span class="highlight">family</span> for a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agent for achieving a reintegration of the <span class="highlight">family</span> must be the community itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has emerged that in cases where a child is at risk of battery by the mother in particular all that is needed is a woman who herself bears some of the battle scars of bringing up a <span class="highlight">family</span>- perhaps her children have now grown up- and who has the time for the endless cups of tea needed to help the mother come to an understanding and to experience, perhaps, the love and affection from that older woman who bears the battle scars, so that the mother in turn can show some affection and love towards the child at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many instances exist where, with access by the telephone to friends, relatives or the <span class="highlight">family</span> medical practitioner, a crisis situation can be, if not resolved, then moderated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of installing such a telephone would be infinitesimal compared with the social cost endured and borne by society eventually when a battery occurs and where medical and social treatment is required for the child and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is highly inimical to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incest is highly disruptive of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does it impair the individual’s capacity for general social relationships but it also disorganises the relationships within the <span class="highlight">family</span>, leading to a confusion of roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could lead to a situation of a father, say, being convicted, shame being brought and, if the father is imprisoned, further fracturing of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, despite all the bluff and the various actions in the English High Court, there was no legal process by which the parents could take that company to court to get monetary compensation for the sheer financial loss they may have suffered in meeting the medical and other expenses in dealing with the child ‘s deformity, and of course no compensation or damages were available for the emotional shock and the continuing emotional situation which that <span class="highlight">family</span> might face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I say, there is no legal right inherent in the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned to recover damages for injuries suffered by the child while in the womb, which injuries become manifest upon the live birth of that child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the situation of a child whose <span class="highlight">family</span> does not have a television set in the home and who at school the next morning is entirely out of touch with the peer group and with what is going on because he has not seen the programs of the night before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a little time they thought that that was ridiculous; they could have him at home with them and be a <span class="highlight">family</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They told St Nicholas Hospital that they would like to take him out of the hospital and take him home where they could live as a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and they would take him to the day centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They received a similar response from this hospital to that taken from an example of another <span class="highlight">family</span>, who wrote the following letter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This contrasts sharply with the typical pattern of development in Down’s syndrome children reared at home in apparently normal <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances but without the benefits of early educational intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel a necessity exists for breaking up the huge hospital complexes with large and unsatisfactory wards into small homelike facilities which have adequate staff and services, where education is possible and where the children live as a <span class="highlight">family</span> and do not have to be just one part of a huge mass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Commissioner of Taxation would need to have regard to ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> and commercial dealings when viewing transactions, but once the dominant intention of avoidance is established, all the sham should be exposed for what it is, a mere artifice of greed, and should have no effect against the revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It includes not only the outrageous and blatant paper schemes such as Curran and its progeny, but also artificial income splitting arrangements of various kinds, involving <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, partnerships and the like, to offset losses against other derived income- an extension of the kind of Pitt Street farmer model. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a hesitantly arrived at guess made very much a guess by the failure of the Treasury, regrettably, to give us such information as is undoubtedly in its possession about the estimated losses that are associated with various kinds of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, partnerships, superannuation and other kinds of schemes in that general category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that for a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> the first $3,893 only is tax-free, whereas the first $7,786 is tax-free where husband and wife work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister confirm or deny the accuracy of the reported survey of the Overseas Students Service that the average <span class="highlight">family</span> income in question is of the order of only $A8,000 to $A9,000, and will he agree that if this is the case- or if he cannot deny it- the proposed fees represent an unjustifiable order of magnitude? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The picture of the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> is one of sturdy independence, of people who have been able to handle hire purchase and all the various forms of credit over the years, and to handle them with solvency and with no need for lectures from doctrinaire socialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the whole question of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts came out in Australia earlier this year, the Prime Minister flamboyantly announced that he had disposed of his own <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did so after <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts had become useless vehicles for tax avoidance in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I preface it by saying that the annual report of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Tasmania Incorporated states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Department of Health instructed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Tasmania Incorporated not to increase its clinic services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In 1975 approval was given for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Tasmania to receive a grant and, since that year, the Department of Health, through the Minister, has continued to support the clinical activities of the Association and has increased its grant therefor in each financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that early discussions regarding non-expansion and financial constraint took place in November 1 977 with the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy restraint was applied also to grants for education, information and training activities supported under the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 29 March of this year, in the other place, the Minister for Health appealed to the State governments to support the development of a comprehensive Australia-wide <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, State government support for <span class="highlight">family</span> planning activities varies as between individual States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not usual for State governments to provide to the Department of Health details of grants made to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, on the basis of the reports produced by the various State <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations, details of grants by the State governments to these associations in 1978-79, for information and education activities, are set out in a list which I have before me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In response to the particular inquiry made by  Senator Walters  with regard to clinical activities, I draw attention to the discussions that I have mentioned, held in 1 977, concerning the activities of the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations, which emphasised the need for financial restraint to be exercised in regard to these programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is a matter of historical record that Simon Fraser was one of the people involved in floating land banks in Melbourne in the 1 880s and 1 890s and that the fortunes of that <span class="highlight">family</span> were partially established at the expense of the depositors who lost their money in those banks; that that was not the only fortune in Melbourne that was established that way; and that  Mr Fraser  is not the only descendant of families which established their fortunes in that way who currently sits in this Parliament representing the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking as one who has seen the work of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on the refugee island of Bidong in the South China Sea, can the Minister indicate whether departmental officers have any specific instructions relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span> distribution situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, my question is about a very old financial institution in South Australia which must be very close to the concern of your <span class="highlight">family</span> because of its long links with that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Revision of sections 62 and 63 of the Migration Act 1 9S8, which provide for offences in respect of the removal and carriage from Australia of children in respect of whom custody or access orders have been made or arc being sought, to give them broader application, and relocation of the provisions to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 where their existence should become more generally known; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until these measures had been implemented the Ministers suggested that people who suspected their children may be removed from Australia by the other parent should consult a solicitor, or a registry of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia or the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory for information on preventive measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by reminding him that on 23 May 1979 I placed on notice a question regarding the late  Mr Tommy  White Jagamara of Ti Tree who was killed in a road accident in which members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> were injured, and that subsequently parts of that question were answered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The boarding allowances provided under this Scheme comprise a means-test-free basic allowance of $500 per annum, on average about $12 per week, and an additional allowance of up to a further $500 per annum, which is subject both to actual boarding costs and a means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is precisely because of the social and <span class="highlight">family</span> tragedies that go with unemployment that we have pressed, to the fullest extent, for wage and salary restraint in hearings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I might add that the change to the end of the school year was made upon the application of  Mr Davey  himself, who pointed out that he had a young <span class="highlight">family</span> attending school in Fitzroy Crossing and did not want to disrupt the education program of his daughter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Within one’s own <span class="highlight">family</span> circle, when the idea is tossed around of whether the <span class="highlight">family</span> can afford a new room or a new roof on the house, the idea has to be sold to other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know also that there is power in the High Court to ‘read down’ powers, as happened in regard to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, so that they fit within the constitutional framework and so that they can operate without defeating the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us go beyond the refugees and look at those people who come under the definition of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not name some of the ethnic groups involved, but sometimes a nod is as good as a wink and often a <span class="highlight">family</span> will prevail on a person to overstay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could also apply to a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a fruit shop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions are sought we are always a bit sceptical about the conditions which will apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further point I would like to bring up is that it seems to discriminate against families, unless there is a <span class="highlight">family</span> rate rather than the individual rate that is listed in the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only assume from the list of charges that it is an individual rate and that each member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> may be charged individually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill does extend the program, but neither the Bill nor the second reading speech tell us very much about the future of the program, except that some youth refuges will be established under the Youth Services Program in the Office of Child Care, that some homeless people already receive support under the Community Health Program- that is, women’s shelters, and they have done so for four or five years- and that other homeless people receive support from welfare housing and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Support Services Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Consultative Council on Social Welfare has produced a report on the result of a survey which indicates that the major causes of youth homelessness are youth unemployment and <span class="highlight">family</span> difficulties caused by unemployment among other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the World Population Conference in 1974, assistance to the population sector is no longer considered to be limited to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning activities, but instead is considered to embrace activities in all areas that influence population- such as nutrition, sanitation, health, education, the status of women and economic factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the current <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme brought increased assistance to some 300,000 families with 800,000 children who, simply because of their low incomes did not benefit fully, or at all, from the previous system of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provision for the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances on a daily basis where the child moves from one person to another or enters or leaves an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is payable in periods which commence on the fifteenth day of one month and end on the fourteenth day of the next month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can mean that a person or institution having the care of a child for the greater part of a period but not the commencement, receives nothing by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">family</span> allowance apply also to the double orphan’s pension and the handicapped child’s allowance, but the handicapped child’s allowance is not payable to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the absence of a child from the <span class="highlight">family</span> home for a few days covering the commencement of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance period can result in the non-payment to the parent or guardian of amounts of $47.70 and $65 a month respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of a handicapped child ‘s allowance the absence of a child from the private home for a short period can be disregarded and payment continued uninterrupted provided <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance continues to be payable to the parent or guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, under existing conditions, if a child enters an institution to which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is payable the parent or guardian loses handicapped child ‘s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said, ‘Is this unemployment that they are affected by directly, or is this unemployment in their immediate <span class="highlight">family</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I was told that as a general rule it was their own unemployment that was the cause of their being homeless, because of the effect their being unemployed had on their own immediate <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as what we consider are sins of commission in the legislation, there are sins of omission in regard to the unemployed without dependants, the level of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the level of supplementary allowances for rental paid to pensioners and beneficiaries and the level of allowances to pensioners’ children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>an increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to compensate for their erosion by inflation ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the Bill to which the Opposition has no objection are those which provide for twice-yearly indexation of pensions and benefits; those which provide an extension of income limits for pensioner fringe benefits; the extension of the wife’s pension to women in approved benevolent homes; the extension of the wife’s pension to women who are separated from their husbands because of illness or because they or their husbands are in benevolent homes; and the correction of the anomaly in the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and handicapped children’s allowances monthly which occurs when children are in institutions or away for a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They remain at the level of $36 a week that they were given in 1975, despite escalating costs, despite a great increase in their numbers and particularly despite the fact that, as was noted by all speakers on the legislation dealing with the homeless persons assistance program, they are increasingly joining the ranks of the homeless in the community because of their own unemployment and because of <span class="highlight">family</span> stress caused by adult unemployment in their families and homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is a comparison of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances as they have been paid since they were introduced in 1976 and as they would have been paid had they been indexed to this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The first table demonstrates that the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> in this country is below the poverty line on $ 140 a week with three or more children; on $160 a week, with four or more children; and on $ 1 80 a week, with five or more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the initial benefit given to low income families by the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in 1976, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children is $20 a month worse off and a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children is $39 a month worse off in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such cases the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and the double orphan’s pension has gone to that institution, even though the child might have been in the institution for only two days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to compensate for their erosion by inflation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for Social Security, by pointing out that Commonwealth support for the Children’s Services Program is by subsidy to selected child care and <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres and has the effect of creating competition between subsidised and unsubsidised private child care centres which operate in the same region; further, that the Commonwealth subsidy is designed to assist disadvantaged children, yet there are regions where only unsubsidised centres are situated, thus depriving disadvantaged children in that region of access to assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that my statements on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have been deliberately misinterpreted in this place and another place during this debate and other debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no intention ever of introducing a policy whereby <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will be removed from anyone in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are a recognition that it costs money to bring up children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My suggestion-I make no bones about it- is that increases in the amount of money spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should, if possible, be distributed more to those in need, the low income families which I spoke about and whose position was demonstrated in the tables which were incorporated in  Hansard,  and less to families on high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if possible, I would introduce a <span class="highlight">family</span> income supplement to complement the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, not to replace it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be the case whether one was seeking a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, a widow’s pension, an age pension or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has been frozen since the new scheme was first introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Grimes  reminded us, the  Age  editorial- which I readsaid that the right of a person in a civilised society to be able to expect a reasonable standard of living for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> is a right, not a privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to compensate for their erosion by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate calls on the Government to introduce sixmonthly indexation of repatriation and social security benefits, in particular, pensions and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in addition to compensating families for the erosion of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that has taken place the allowances should be taken out of politics and indexed every six months to avoid the difficulties that are being experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not do anything by the next election, every mother of five children will be told by me and others that the Government has taken away $500 a year from her because it has failed to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances have not been indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, as has been said in this chamber and elsewhere, was just a book entry scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old child endowment scheme and the tax rebate system were abolished and replaced with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then come to paragraph (6), which seeks an increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to compensate for their erosion by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to higher income families was limited, and a <span class="highlight">family</span> income supplement was paid to lower income and larger families on the basis of <span class="highlight">family</span> size and income, the distribution of such funds would be directed to those in need, and therefore do most good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one would argue with that proposition but it may be serious news to those who are receiving the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that those allowances will be limited for some people and that there may be a <span class="highlight">family</span> income supplement on a means tested basis for other families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is some expression of what the policy with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is, such an expression which allows for an increase in those allowances to compensate for their erosion by inflation may mean an increase for some people but not for all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may mean a change in the universal system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there are those who talk of economic difficulties and those who talk of the responsibilities of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, we need to look at whether these costs- be they $200m or $500m- are to be raised by increased taxation or by withdrawing from those over 70 years of age some of the means test free pensions which they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government clearly needs to strike a balance between the objective to improve real levels of income security assistance and the desire of the taxpayer in this country to retain resources to support the living standards of himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Harradine  that whilst it may provide some compensation to families to receive more in the way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, if as a result of those increased allowances a higher level of taxation is imposed on those families who are struggling to support themselves, this may be counter-productive and not the best way in which to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married man with two children would have received, including <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, some 50.5 per cent of average weekly earnings at December 1978, compared with 48.4 per cent at the end of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matters that ought to be drawn to the attention of honourable senators include some of the comments that have been made with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in general, because this is now an important aspect of the social security system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is said that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have not been increased, in social security matters we still draw attention to the fact that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances go to the lowest income families who did not benefit from the previous scheme of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider that an important thing, I think that those who have urged that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances be indexed or increased would support what I believe was an important social innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that the Government is committed to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme and that it finds that the Australian community supports this scheme very strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it might be an argument to talk about giving an additional benefit to the lowest income families, I think there would be general alarm if this were done at the expense of other families who have received <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for some years now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures are a little different from the Henderson poverty line figures which show that a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> was not working would receive $76.10 a week as against the $75.20 a week which I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the fact that the figures for other <span class="highlight">family</span> payments would show similar differences if the other allowances that are available to those with dependent children were included in the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that instance, I think we could be looking at the figures for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with four children on the table incorporated by  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we provide an income security system for redistributive purposes which imposes such a high level of tax on the <span class="highlight">family</span> that is trying to support itself, we will find that very great difficulties would ensue and that new difficulties will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, if they did come from a wealthy <span class="highlight">family</span> there would still be some discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I hold a letter from a Tasmanian lady well known in the field of overseas student assistance,  Mrs Margaret  Eldridge, the convener of the Host <span class="highlight">Family</span> Scheme for Overseas Students in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that the statistics of <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes of overseas students have not been available to tertiary institutions or to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can only be speculation as to the actual <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes of the overseas students who will pay these charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just concentrating on the programs and services for families and children, the Committee could have asked: Why do we not know who is receiving the benefits from the Children’s Services Program or from <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What do we know about the worth or effectiveness of the counselling services of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is it that at State level we cannot compare institutional with <span class="highlight">family</span> foster care for children, although the Commonwealth is extensively funding both? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Senator Baume said that we do not really know how effective the expenditure on children ‘s services or <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is worth while doing what  Senator Watson  has suggested- investigate the adequacy of the compensation for the cattle and the pigs that has been paid to  Mr Antypas  and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my knowledge, as I have said in another place, he has supported a very poor <span class="highlight">family</span> by feeding it and by helping clothe the children when others in the near community were not so concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I deplore the attitude of some members of the community and hope that, by some of us speaking out and defending the <span class="highlight">family</span>, that sort of rumour mongering will be squashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, statistics were kept for all registries since 1 March 1979 and for the four months ended 30 June 1979 the percentage of waivers of the $100 <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court fee was 5.8 per cent of applications for dissolution received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I gave very close consideration to the question whether the appointment of an additional <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judge to Townsville could be made but in the end was persuaded that the additional costs involved and the demands of the Brisbane registry, and indeed other circuit areas related to Brisbane, were such that it would be a more efficient use of the additional judge if he or she were based in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I welcome it very much and likewise with  Senator Coleman,  who is a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, I have had the opportunity to appreciate the loss which we have had in the lack of studies in this area and the lack of co-ordination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not quite understand  Senator Coleman  in her fears that  Dr Edgar  and the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies would not be doing the studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are directed towards filling in the gaps and showing how we are going in this <span class="highlight">family</span> law area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a Committee, looking at the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and its operation, we cannot answer some questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not start off like, unfortunately, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which started off under-staffed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After the couple moved in, the landlord or the agent discovered that there was a black partner in the marriage and every conceivable method was used to remove that <span class="highlight">family</span> from that accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Treasurer considering a proposal for income splitting for tax purposes between husbands and wives with a view to helping the one income <span class="highlight">family</span> unit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that such a scheme would be very regressive, of little value to a low income <span class="highlight">family</span>, but worth more than $5,000 a year to a professional man with a taxable income of $50,000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepting the desirability of ensuring equitable tax treatment for the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>, as I am sure all on this side of the chamber do, could not this result be achieved more simply, more economically and more equitably by increasing the tax allowance for a dependent spouse and making the allowance a tax credit rather than a deduction from taxable income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They now contain items of novel interest like the right to marry and found a <span class="highlight">family</span>, the right to free education and the right to free elections although very few of them can enjoy any of those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was supposed to be an advance at the time of its introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of what has happened under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, we have all decided that we want to have a second look at that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I particularly ask concerning the reuniting of Vietnamese families when a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On its own admission virtually every member of the present Cabinet operates some sort of a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, the explicit purpose of which is to avoid paying taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most important of all, there has been the abolition of gift and death duties and the removal of serious problems and serious loss in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of the amendment is to accord to judgments of the Federal Court, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the Supreme Courts of the Territories, the same status as judgments of supreme courts of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Three circumstances were recognized by the Senate Committee in its report where this approach was justified, namely, to achieve uniformity in the exercise of a particular federal jurisdiction, to provide as a matter of policy for informality in proceedings (as in <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law proceedings) and where it is desired to set court fees on a particular basis is furtherance of a particular policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures show that the average first home buyer in Australia is a young <span class="highlight">family</span> purchasing a house costing about $34,000, although this varies between cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main substantive change in this particular Bill is the removal of the power of a casting vote from the Chief Justice where there is an equality of judges, an evenly divided court, in appeals from the Federal Court, from Territory Supreme Courts, or from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absurd to suggest that that situation would be abused because I know that they are both <span class="highlight">family</span> men who want to spend as much time as conceivable with their wives and families in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the easiest ways of avoiding financial disclosure is simply to transfer assets within a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interests of members of the person’s immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> should similarly be disclosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the reason for the continuing delay in promulgating regulations under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975, s. 1 1 1, to enable performance of Australia’s obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance signed on 20 June 1956, which matter was the subject of House of Representatives Question on Notice Nos 233 of 1977, 121 of 1978 and 799 of 1978, by the Honourable E. G. Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme means that the low income earner with a dependent spouse will pay a greater increase in taxation than the high to very high income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced in 1976, the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, promoted it as a great breakthrough for the families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that happened was that the allowances were paid to supporting parents instead of tax deductions being allowed to the <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have remained frozen since the 1976 levels, their value has become sharply reduced by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly loss to a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child is $2.50; with two children it is $3.40; with three children it is $4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the scheme that  Mr Fraser  said was a great breakthrough for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that we have is unemployment with its misery and insecurity that are continually destroying the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are prepared to build hospitals and to provide all other services but we do not look at what is happening to the structure of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is important for a <span class="highlight">family</span> at least once a year to get away and have a break from what they have been doing for the rest of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another one affected by this decision was Henrique Simoes who lost his job with the Department of Finance and whose application to immigrate to Australia also did not meet the requirements laid down by the so called ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> reunion ‘policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Timorese wonder whether, when the Government decided on the present criterion, they based it on an Anglo-Saxon concept of ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> ‘ whereby <span class="highlight">family</span> ties do not appear to be as binding and complex as they are in the more traditional ways of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and time again I have the question put to me as to whether, in accordance to Australian custom, once married a person is expected to consider as <span class="highlight">family</span> the spouse and children solely, forsaking all other relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They find it extremely difficult to relate the ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> reunion’ bit to the Government’s attitude of consistently refusing to allow precisely that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time this estimate has been refined, to accommodate a more comprehensive operating plan which calls for extensive use of the aircraft on personnel and <span class="highlight">family</span> movement and allows for the progressive assumption of maintenance responsibility by the RAAF in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators know, the expenditure of the Queen of England is questioned in the House of Commons, as are the allowances paid to the whole of her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we would all support what  Senator Harradine  said, knowing the difficulties facing the <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring up the matter of the apparent lack of judges, or commissionerswhatever they are called- in <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rang the Registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Adelaide and spoke to his secretary, who advised me that if I got the solicitor of the person concerned to write to the Registrar the Registrar might put that man’s name higher up on the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a lurking suspicion that there is overlapping: that the inspectors go into a shop or factory that is reasonably organised rather than into these small establishments, even <span class="highlight">family</span> places, which sometimes make amazing mistakes when they are compiling someone’s annual leave entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No person should be compelled to leave the paid work force, neither should any <span class="highlight">family</span> be forced by economic or other pressures to have both partners working in the paid work force to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, when we consider the estimates for the Department of Social Security, I will make the point that there is a need to lift the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and even to consider the payment of a home-makers allowance to relieve the economic pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only means we have in this country of redistributing income to those families under the current legislation is through the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which I believe we can reform quickly and reasonably to redirect funds to low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if they had been indexed under the present system across the board through all income levels, the increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to the high income families would be meaningless because of their incomes and the increase in income to the low income families would have been inadequate to raise their income sufficiently to get them anywhere near the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to use the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme we must look, I believe, at methods of redirecting some of the increased payments under that scheme to the low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This does not mean taking away money from people who at present receive <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means deciding that the amount of money in this country which is spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances can be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this money should be directed as much as possible to those people as has been done in Canada and other countries through a <span class="highlight">family</span> income supplement or whatever it is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are serious about redirecting income in this community to those in need we must look seriously at using the present amount of money we pay on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The low income <span class="highlight">family</span> of a person working for a wage in the community is completely left out of our present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not come into our social security or income support system in any way except through the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can easily be adapted to pay a higher <span class="highlight">family</span> income supplement to those who are in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister introduced the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme in 1 976 with a great fanfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> income support scheme cannot be introduced which directs funds to low income families, certainly we should at least introduce indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were willing to spend $ 1 billion on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in 1976 we should be willing to spend at least $ 1 ,300m on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in 1979 with the level of indexation we have had since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The number of divorcees in Australia appears to have settled at about 40,000 a year, following a high of 63,000 in 1976 which was the first full year after the 1975 Murphy <span class="highlight">family</span> law amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message more directly conveyed by the figures I have just quoted is that the disintegration of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in Australian society is now making significant inroads into the pattern of Government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit comes under increasing economic and social stress, problems previously taken care of within the <span class="highlight">family</span> are being passed on to governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple, fact, which I believe governments everywhere are failing to recognise, is that some caring functions are achieved more economically within the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit than outside it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often governments could save themselves much expenditure of effort and funds if they adopted a positive approach to protecting the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support what other speakers have said in respect of the Social Security estimates on the question of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take the example of the emergence of the dual income <span class="highlight">family</span> as an acceptable or desirable situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those families have noted the disappearance of the maternity allowance, the 35 per cent erosion in the real value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments, and the way in which they are regularly catapulted into higher taxation brackets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is, and I ask the Minister to comment on this, that if governments only woke up they would realise that a small amount of justice and equity today would remove the necessity in future years for massive expenditures in dealing with the end results of the disintegration of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes and  Senator Harradine  have made reference to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and to the need for a review of the level of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and of payments that are made under social security systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not been able to increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances since their introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been stated, over $ 1 ,000m has been paid by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will briefly comment on the reply made by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  particularly in regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced and we were willing to spend some $ 1,000m on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We aired our concern that the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance may well have provided for the Government a let-out to avoid the revenue problems which may have arisen by the indexation of the children’s rebate when the Government had a policy of full tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened is what we predicted would happen, that is the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has remained the same and its value has been eroded by 35 per cent or 36 per cent because of inflation since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am suggesting is that we take a serious look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme- a well understood scheme, an efficient scheme, a scheme which above all in almost all cases in the community pays money to mothers- so that we can redistribute some of the funds to those who need the assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that redistribution of income is a dirty word to some people on the other side of the chamber but the only system that we have in existence at the moment which is administratively effective and administratively simple to redistribute money- and God knows everybody accepts that we need to redistribute money to some of these people- is in fact the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cannot graft onto the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances schemes a <span class="highlight">family</span> income supplement by using this efficient, accessible system, we should at least index the allowance, as ineffective as that would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to grants to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a notice of motion on the Notice Paper stating that payment should not be made to those organisations in the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning area which regard abortion as a legitimate means of fertility control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have reviewed  Mr Lee’s  application in the light of information presented to me and have decided that he may be granted resident status provided he, and his <span class="highlight">family</span> members overseas, are able to meet the relevant migration requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ear  Sir, I  beg you to advise the Immigration to allow my <span class="highlight">family</span> to join me &amp; should a favourable reply be received from Irian everybody will be Happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally this caused distress to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both means tests are based on the ‘adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income’, viz. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table below sets out the levels of adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income (AFI) at which the maximum and minimum levels of allowance are payable in 1979 and 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it does make recommendations- as it seems to have done here- with regard to matters which come within my areas of responsibility, such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, no doubt in due course I will be advised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without going into any detail, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act does have provisions for the making of injunctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Chipp  has drawn my attention to this matter, I certainly will seek advice as to what is recommended and also see in what way the proposals expand or differ from the provisions in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would scrupulously, carefully and honestly go through them to see whether he would claim 8 to 10, as it then was, for chemist’s expenses for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pty Ltd has sought Government approval to acquire three properties, which it has entered into contracts to acquire conditional on Government approval being received, comprising a total area of approximately 833 hectares, namely: about 616 hectares in the County of Palmerston, Parishes of Woodlands and Rosslyn, extending west from the existing resort boundary to the Byfield/Yeppoon road, owned by Setu Nominees Pty Ltd; about 215 hectares in the County of Livingstone, Parish of Rosslyn, adjacent to the Byfield/Yeppoon road, owned by the Atkinson <span class="highlight">family</span>; about 2 hectares in the County of Palmerston, Parish of Woodlands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A single income <span class="highlight">family</span> on an income below $ 1 5,000 a year is virtually excluded from the Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This expenditure covers a range of services designed to support children and their families, including centre and <span class="highlight">family</span> based day care, pre-schools, toy libraries, children’s services field staff and playgroup support services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable  Senator will  be also aware of the two innovative programs that this Government has introduced under the Children ‘s Services Program: the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Support Services Program, aimed at encouraging and assisting the development of a range of services to SUPport families in their responsibilities in the rearing and development of children; and the Youth Services Program, which provides support for emergency accommodation and ancillary services such as housing referral and counselling, in recognition of the problems of youth, including increasing disruption to <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships and increasing homelessness problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did an Australian Legal Aid officer inform the Fitzroy Legal Service by telephone that dissolution of married proceedings would only be considered imperative, and therefore receive legal aid, in circumstances where: (a) the applicant seeking ALAO aid for dissolution proceedings is living in a defacto relationship, there are children of that relationship and the applicant wants a divorce in order to marry his or her defacto; (b) the applicant, and only the applicant, is suffering from a terminal disease and wishes to order his or her affairs before death; (c) the applicant and his or her spouse dispute some aspect of the settlement of property between them and, because these matters can only be determined by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court after dissolution proceedings have been undertaken, the applicant can be aided in the divorce proceedings, and after the property proceedings- in other words, aid in divorce is granted in order to speed up the hearing of the property dispute; or (d) there is evidence of extremely detrimental behaviour, which divorce may alleviate, on the part of the applicant’s spouse, for example, where the applicants spouse has ignored an existing restraining order because of the continuance of the marriage relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will make advice on the conduct of dissolution proceedings more accessible to persons who do not reside close to the major propulation centres where a lawyer of the Australian Legal Aid Office or a Registry of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, needy persons who live outside metropolitan areas, more than SO kilometres from a centre where advice may be obtained from an Australian Legal Aid Office lawyer or from a Registry of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, will be able to obtain advice on the matters mentioned from a private solicitor practising in their locality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the short term, many ofthe programs already sponsored by the Government in respect of Aboriginal affairs have the capacity to meet the needs of discharged prisoners for transient accommodation, employment and employment training, personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare support services, legal advice and liaison services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>Those students may be at risk for a variety of reasons; maybe for <span class="highlight">family</span> or community reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></li>
