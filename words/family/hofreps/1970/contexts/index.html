    <p>Mr Ellis  informed me of the circumstances surrounding one of Australia’s representatives at the Munich Olympic Games,  Mr John  Kinsela, who is a member of a big <span class="highlight">family</span> and also has a wife and child to support, and said that when he went to the Games the <span class="highlight">family</span> became destitute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should certainly like something in writing because in my own opinion I do not think that a request has ever been made by any other member for assistance for the wife and child and also <span class="highlight">family</span> of any person who has been selected to go to the Olympic Games’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said, which is a matter of quite demonstrable fact from the statistics which the Government publishes, namely, that more taxpayers would be better off in Australia if <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were doubled and all other deductions were eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is because the percentage of interest deductible is not affected by <span class="highlight">family</span> size, it being based on actual income before personal deductions; but the effective marginal tax rate and hence the tax saving of a <span class="highlight">family</span> is in some cases lower since it has more personal deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there have been numerous complaints regarding the working of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, including allegations of delay, inability of magistrates to deal with certain matters, complexity of defended litigation and the inability of the Act to protect the weaker party to marriages, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me turn to one little item- <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did it not index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nobody can claim his children as a tax deduction now because he gets a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government indexed taxation but did not index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amendment will allow the Government to acquire the land that it wants without impairing the rights of appeal of the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will he confirm that Grosvenor Nominees Pty Ltd is a company which is owned and/or controlled by him and/or his <span class="highlight">family</span>, as was stated in evidence given a week ago before the commission inquiring into Victorian Housing Commission land purchases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he also confirm that this <span class="highlight">family</span> company financed the purchase by  Mr Peter  Leake of about 60 allotments at Balnarring from Stumpy Gully Estates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Opposition stated so clearly earlier in this debate,in its amendment to the motion for the second reading, that this Bill fails to take measures to alleviate the increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> tax burdens which has arisen as a result of the Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So this is not the way to achieve what we in Opposition want to achieve, namely greater benefits for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have taken it on myself to take a very keen interest in, to the extent of almost looking after, one <span class="highlight">family</span> which lost its breadwinner because he took a boat to sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a very sad business because the mother of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a Tahitian who can hardly speak English and she has four little children to look after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It goes to the low income earner with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>; it goes into certain migrant groups and reaches into homes where the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a female on low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In time of <span class="highlight">family</span> crisis, faced with the worry of sudden illness or injury, they face the added burden of knowing that they must encounter a long trip to a city hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first criteria examined by the lending institutions is the income of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is done to ensure that the <span class="highlight">family</span> can afford the instalment repayments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is bad enough for the working man to be dragged away from his home at night when he should be with his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> but it is even worse when he has to send his wife out to work in order to make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not the same concept as that of  Sir Robert  Menzies - not that I wish to appear to be an apostle of  Sir Robert  Menzies - who stated that the scholarships were created to ‘benefit those who might otherwise miss, through <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances, the final 2 school years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are setting out to give everybody an equal opportunity in life, we should bear in mind that, if we give a child from an underprivileged <span class="highlight">family</span> the same education as a child who has an adequate home environment, the child from the underprivileged <span class="highlight">family</span> will make less of that same education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must take this opportunity to refer to the incorrect, ungenerous and most unfair remarks he made about the former honourable members for Sturt,  Sir Keith  Wilson and his son, because the Wilson <span class="highlight">family</span> has made a tremendous contribution towards providing homes for the aged in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The efforts of this <span class="highlight">family</span> and other people have been so successful that they have received on behalf of South Australia about 30% of the entire Commonwealth contribution for homes for the aged which, as honourable members will know, is provided on a basis of $2 for $1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House expresses its deep regret at me death on 1st April 1970 of James Reay Fraser, a member of the House for the Australian Capital Territory, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he know that the Australian Broadcasting Commission and other news sources are referring to the visit of the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> as ‘the Royal tour of Australia’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> is spending about 5 weeks in Australia, mainly in New South Wales and Victoria, would he even at this late stage try to get the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> to go to Western Australia even for a short visit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member and the House generally will understand the calls that are made upon the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> on a tour of this kind and that, though they may well like to attend every part of Australia, it is in the time they are able to make available impossible for them to do so, and their wishes and the requirements of the Royal tour director must be taken into account in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should point out that the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span> is visiting, not only New South Wales and Victoria, but also Queensland and Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Local officers may qualify for a <span class="highlight">family</span> needs allowance depending upon salary, location and <span class="highlight">family</span> size, e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a  local officer employed in Port Moresby who maintains a <span class="highlight">family</span> of four and whose salary is less than $930 per annum would receive an allowance to raise his salary  to  that amount ($17.83 per week). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such grants are made by way of rations in subsistence farming areas and by cash, not exceeding Five dollars per <span class="highlight">family</span> per week, in urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such grants are required only in a few cases, as relatives in need are usually supported by kinsmen under traditional arrangements which are a feature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship of Papuans and New Guineans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 13th April 1970 of the Honourable Gerald Colin McKellar, a senator for the State of New South Wales from 1958 and a Minister of the Crown from 1964 to 1969, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proper foundation for government is a universal law of right and wrong self-evident to the intuitive commonsense of every man; that freedom is a power of personal self-direction which no man can delegate to another; that the purpose of society is not the protection of property but fulfilment of the needs of living human beings; that good citizens have the right and duty, not only to overthrow incurably oppresive governments, but before that point is reached to break particular oppressive laws; and that we owe our ultimate allegiance, not to this or that nation, but to the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that his interjection was as flippant as other interjections of his sometimes are, because without protection from a worthwhile, respectable, sincere and decent police force for the honourable member and his <span class="highlight">family</span> he would be in a pretty odd situation from time to time after some of his more provocative speeches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Government - or is it unreasonable to ask - as the Master Builders Association asked and as every young married couple seeking a block of land so as to build a home and raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> asks: What does the Government intend to do about the level of residential land prices which is a serious national problem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a man - or a woman - who throughout his life made his contribution to the development and progress of a country and who has paid income taxes, rates, levies and duties throughout his lifetime, have the savings or the residue from the taxed earnings subjected to a further tax upon death? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The death of a shareholder does not necessarily mean that the company suffers directly or that the company has to dispose of the estate to pay the estate duty of the shareholder’s <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This does not mean a change of hands from father to son or changes within a <span class="highlight">family</span>, but a sale to another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that within this section of primary industry, where the turnover of land is infrequent, considerable death duties are collected from the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a wheat farm changes hands completely only once in 52 years, the <span class="highlight">family</span> is penalised because of the application of probate and estate duties when in the meantime it passes from father to son or sons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too often we see a highly efficient property that has been built up by <span class="highlight">family</span> labour and is using its resources efficiently in terms of either physical or economic criteria and then because of probate or death duty there is a break up in the partnership which causes the property to be sold or often to be split up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are <span class="highlight">family</span> farms in the main and they are quite different structurally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But his net income is simply not big enough, after his costs have been taken into account, to allow for replacement of capital or for him to give his <span class="highlight">family</span> a decent living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the proposed reliefs is to provide assistance to discourage the breaking up of economic rural holdings, particularly <span class="highlight">family</span> holdings, because of the need to pay estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A long standing principle in death duty law is that greater relief in death duties be given to beneficiaries who are members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leaving of estates to persons other than members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> means that those in receipt of assets from an estate are worse off because, firstly, they pay higher duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> company’ - I think that we could define it in this way - means a company all the shares in which at the date of a relevant person’s death are beneficially owned by that person or him and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of that matter, I wish to request the Government to give consideration to allowing this relief of duty to an estate which is left to a <span class="highlight">family</span> company, defined as may be necessary and with appropriate provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I. believe that this suggestion is consistent with the recognition by the Government that <span class="highlight">family</span> companies need not be treated with disadvantage as against individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we allow shares in <span class="highlight">family</span> companies with rural assets, included in estates, to qualify as primary producers, we should allow such <span class="highlight">family</span> class of companies, properly defined, to be given the same advantage as relatives when named as beneficiaries of such estates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> heritage is one thing; tax avoidance is another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have a situation of crisis in which the same hot money is standing by to buy up properties of <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprises which, as has been conceded by honourable members on both sides of the House today, have the record of being the most effective and efficient in absolute terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns a <span class="highlight">family</span> which has been farming in Australia for 5 generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of a sudden death in the <span class="highlight">family</span> they face, after 5 generations, extinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seemed that he had covered himself, his <span class="highlight">family</span> and their future adequately; but what has happened? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not he tried to adjust his insurance policies, the fact remains that he could not do so because the financial position of his <span class="highlight">family</span> was such that he could not afford the higher premiums that would have been applicable to his age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the widow, in a plea related to these new valuations, said: This now places an intolerable burden on the property and every member of the <span class="highlight">family</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">family</span> has displayed what has happened following the drought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to go on record in this debate as saying that if the Government is going to wipe out the whole of the <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprises in the countryside of Australia and to replace them with overseas corporations that will strive to follow the pattern, which has been established elsewhere, of controlling the whole of the food industries of the nation from the paddock right through to the housewife, then the honourable member will1 find in his electorate of Evans that he will have no recourse to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the summation of what I have said tonight: That the <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise has been demonstrated to be both efficient and effective and is the backbone of the rural development of the nation; that the current crisis is a product of policies or the absence of policies; that imposts, such as estate duty, must be totally reconstructed; that this small measure should be only a prelude to this being done as a matter of urgency; and that the vote on the amendment that has been put forward should be a vote of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand my colleagues and I have recognised for a very long time that the rapid increase in valuations is an imposition on the farming community, and that is the reason for this measure, lt is a measure designed to relieve the rural industries of a very substantial cost factor in terms of the maintenance of rural properties so that they might be able to continue not in perpetuity precisely but to continue as the interest of a <span class="highlight">family</span> or a descendant in a particular way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Riverina went on to illustrate the position of a <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise which as a result of this crisis - and 1 presume he is talking about the crisis we have heard him to be so vocal about in recent times - sees the end of an occupancy of a farm after 5 generations of, I presume, ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man asked that in view of the special and difficult circumstances in which he found himself an exception be made in his case and that the undertaking given to him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> should be honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where more than1 child from a <span class="highlight">family</span> attend a school, the total fee payable is $1 at primary and S3 at secondary schools, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might interest honourable members to know that it is on record in the current copy of ‘Box Office’, which is the periodical that is circulated to most film exhibitors throughout the world, that almost 90% of the top box office attractions are the wholesome <span class="highlight">family</span> type film. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we can say this: We can examine the films which have been successful and we will find that in most cases they have been the type of film, as I said before, that appeals to a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a number of migrants do not make application for Australian citizenship results, I believe, from a fusion of factors which would include indecision at to longterm permanent residence in Australia; the fact that they may be waiting for other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to become eligible before themselves making application; unawareness of the importance of citizenship; or being aware, the fact that they have not come to the point of making application or would prefer to become further established in the Australian community before playing a complete and meaningful part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our scheme seeks to preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the other hand, the general practitioner, as the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, has a most important role in the community - a role that is most rewarding to those who are motivated in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is the only one who can provide <span class="highlight">family</span> medical counselling, preventative treatment and early recognition of the presence of disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must supplement these financial provisions with initiatives aimed at ensuring that the general practitioner remains, as the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, the keystone of the health system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who have had any experience at all know the tremendous valueof a general practitioner, the old <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That doctor is a very important person to the <span class="highlight">family</span> not only in providing medical care but also in providing assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> in many other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, those of us who have had any experience of this relationship realise the tremendous value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor to <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Statistically, most of the medical expenses in this community are incurred by patients visiting their <span class="highlight">family</span> doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a view overlooks the regard that the public still has and will continue to have for the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor and the natural desire on the patient’s part to have one doctor treat him for all conditions for which he is competent to treat him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly he does not want the overwhelming cost of such care to threaten the whole economic basis of his life and his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the fairly constant recurring factors in his income and they provide the basic bread and butter for him and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have here a pamphlet circulated by general practitioners that suggests that where the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor could not be paid he received bunches of flowers, baskets of fruit, and onions and potatoes instead of the fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but I often received gifts in addition to the fee in gratitude for the treatment that a <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor can give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plantations, or farms, in these areas are worked as <span class="highlight">family</span> projects by <span class="highlight">family</span> groups and there are no contracts as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the practices ordinarily followed within the medical profession, the referring doctor will usually be the patient’s <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, lt is the Government’s objective that this proposal, which has been developed in the interests of patients, will be operated in such  a  way that it docs not have an adverse effect on general practice, or needlessly inflate the cost of the national health service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-55">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned about the ultimate effect this may have on the general patient - the person in the country, in an outlying area or in an outer suburban area who, in the event of an emergency, whether he be a person involved in a car accident at the corner, a son falling off a table, somebody cutting his foot or who suffers from any of the 100,000 things that can happen in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, requires medical attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the general practitioner who knows the circumstances of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and the background of the children’s health, and who has treated that <span class="highlight">family</span> for years and knows the ailments from which members of that <span class="highlight">family</span> suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He would know more about a member of that <span class="highlight">family</span> than would the specialist to whom that member was referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking myself as an example, I believe that the general practitioner is important to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another method that was suggested in the Labor Party’s health proposals at the time of the last election was that the scheme should be financed by a flat levy of 14% of the taxable income of a <span class="highlight">family</span> up to a maximum of $100 per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is an excessive imposition on a person with a low income or a person with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is for the individual to make up his own mind whether to insure himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the basis of medical care in Australia is the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, the general practitioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this can be done and that some effort should be made to do it, because I think that the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This, of course, means that any medical or hospital expenses for myself or my <span class="highlight">family</span> must be paid out of my own resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So free insurance would go to each lower income earner with a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> of 2 children and on a wage of $45 gross per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our system took into account the fact that the lower income earner has a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and I will show later that the Government’s proposition does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would mean that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 6 children could have a gross income of $57 and still get free insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, if you have an income of $42.50  a  week the Government very generously offers to pay the whole cost of your insurance but again it takes no acount of the size of your <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, on the other hand, a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a wife and, say, 5 children - maybe even more - receiving $50 a week will be required to pay the whole amount of medical insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Nimmo report, upon which this Bill is based to some extent, shows quite clearly that if the Government had been properly sympathetic, properly aware and considerate of the needs of the people, particularly the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, and had it accepted and implemented our proposals - or, better still, had the Labor Party had the opportunity of putting its proposals into practice - a very substantial proportion of our population would have been saved a lot of worry and a lot of expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first responsibility in this industry, as in other industries, must l e with the Government to determine firstly, whether it wants to have an Australian egg industry; and secondly, whether it wants to see Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> units as the mainstay of the industry - whether this is Government policy; thirdly, whether it will provide the guidelines necessary for the production required at home and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objectives of the Commonwealth scheme are twofold: To enable low income dairy farmers who voluntarily wish to do so, to leave the industry and to receive a fair price for their land and improvements; and, after the writing-off of redundant assets, to make the land and useful improvements available to other farmers so as to build up their properties to a viable <span class="highlight">family</span> farm level and, where possible, diversifying the pattern of land use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to associate my colleagues of the Australian Country Party with the references which have been made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to the late  Mr Joshua  and to join in extending the sympathy of my Country Party colleagues to his widow and to the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prime objective has been to encourage regional development of social services throughout the State so that services for handicapped children are located where the children’s families are living or to assist within the immediate region so that <span class="highlight">family</span> involvement can be maintained with the needs of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When speaking of handicapped children I mean children with physical as well as mental handicaps, lt is not possible to divorce the needs of the handicapped child from the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are the most urgent in the early years of the child’s life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill does nothing to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> or the child during this period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Many parents, given assistance at this stage of the child’s life, could later cope with many of the problems which drive them to seek hospital placement as the only means of preventing a complete <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> with a handicapped child is a handicapped <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no justice in a policy that asks not less of this <span class="highlight">family</span> but more because of a misfortune to which it has in no way contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such community services could include visiting social workers, physiotherapists, teacher and speech therapist services, financial assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> whose child’s condition requires this, a home help service - especially with trained personnel - and a visiting nursing service for the very young and for the bedridden or almost totally dependent child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should also be compulsory medical examinations under the national health service for all 4-year-olds to enable earlier assessment of children with special needs due to a disability and hostel accommodation for the aged, orphans, and others unable to live at home for any reason, such as illness, age of parent, distance from a facility, condition of handicapped person in relation to other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, size of <span class="highlight">family</span>, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another form of aid would be the introduction of taxation rebates as a form of social assistance where additional expense is incurred in caring for a handicapped member of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making provision for this assistance, we must guard against not seeing him within the context of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its report this panel of experts saw mental retardation as a national health, social and economic problem affecting in that country 51 million adults and children and involving from 15 million to 20 million <span class="highlight">family</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the effect on the lives of the other members in the <span class="highlight">family</span> it seems absolutely certain that the secret of success is the commencement of the skilled training and education as a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know he had a personal <span class="highlight">family</span> affinity with this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time when our doctors told us that for the future of the rest of our <span class="highlight">family</span> we must place our child in a home, we made inquiries throughout Queensland and in other States as to suitable institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acting on a brochure we received from the Sub-Normal Children’s Welfare Association, we  inspected The Chalet, and were immediately taken with the ‘<span class="highlight">family</span>’ type atmosphere, and the progressive outlook of the director . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell you, the decision to move our child from the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle was not an easy one, and we fully examined alt aspects of his future well-being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also very difficult to raise funds for <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling services using professional social workers because you can’t show touching pictures of children before and after service, or pictures of huge buildings which are monuments to the money that has been raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is becoming increasingly difficult for the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> - group to meet its responsibilities to those children who are not physically handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that in marginal areas there are very large tracts of land that with known technology and within the known economics of dairy production simply will not be able to yield the required productivity per acre or per milking cow to provide a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a reasonable living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if a dairy farmer voluntarily sells his farm, unless he is heavily in debt, he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> walk out with a substantial amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To enable low income dairy farmers who voluntarily wish to do so, to leave the industry and to receive a fair price for their land and improvements: and, after the writing off of redundant assets, to make the land and useful improvements available lo other farmers so as to build up their properties to a viable <span class="highlight">family</span> farm level and, where possible, diversifying the pattern of land use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is a laudable aim -  and, after the writing-off of redundant assets, to make the land and useful improvements available to other farmers so as to build up their properties to a viable <span class="highlight">family</span> farm level and, where possible, diversifying the pattern of land use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide the means of sustaining the average dairy farmer, in particular the owner-operator who, with his <span class="highlight">family</span>, is really the basis or the foundation of a very great industry which has spread across the continent but which is to be found in particular in the northern section of New South Wales, in southern Queensland, in Victoria, in parts of Tasmania and in South Australia and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dairy farming over the years has been mainly a <span class="highlight">family</span> effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, each member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> takes his place in the cowshed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the days are gone when children had to milk cows before they went off to school but in many dairy farms it is still a <span class="highlight">family</span> effort that gets them by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We give them the right to produce children and to accept the responsibilities of <span class="highlight">family</span> maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Young people are associated with charitable groups such as the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span> which engage in collecting food and clothes for needy people at Christmas time and on other occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of additional costs has been borne by the low income earner - that is, the <span class="highlight">family</span> which eats bread and eggs - instead of the Australian taxpayer making up any difference that is needed out of Consolidated Revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s policy, as always, is designed to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer and the small farmers - those who depend entirely on wheat for their income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference between the Government and the Opposition is basically this: The Government believes that the burden of the subsidy element should fall on the low income group, on the man with the big <span class="highlight">family</span> whose children eat the bread and the eggs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is to subsidise the wheat producer under stabilisation, the Federal Treasury or the taxpayer should be the one paying the subsidy and not the low income <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part let me conclude by stating now in the clearest and most categorical terms that 1 am not prepared to sacrifice one traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> farm or farmer to make a Roman holiday for a person who speculates in wheat growing during this time of over production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span>’s standard of living will be determined much more by where they live than by what they earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members may say that that is fair enough but of course he may well have a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> who are entitled to some kind of protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures I have just given are by way of illustration and are based on a <span class="highlight">family</span> of husband and wife and would vary if the <span class="highlight">family</span> included one or more dependent children, or consisted of one parent and a child A further relevant provision is in section 82u (1.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows, if honourable members have been able to trace these provisions through, that the amendment would affect only a very small number of applicants whose means as assessed are equivalent to between $47 a week, which is the eligibility ceiling for the pensioner medical service, and $48.50 a week which is the eligibility ceiling for low income <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been pointed out in this House time and again, it does not matter how efficient a farmer might be in terms of productivity per acre, per manhour or net income per acre or whatever it might be, unless he has sufficient gross income which is directly correlated to the size of his farm he will be unable to support his <span class="highlight">family</span> at a reasonable standard of living and amortise his assets in the farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Tasmania, however, the amount required to be insured in respect of any one claim of any one person in the case of passengers in the insured’s vehicle or members of the insured’s <span class="highlight">family</span> living with him is only $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700818_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, there is a realisation that population pressures must be controlled by <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and birth control measures, and that if <span class="highlight">family</span> planning is successful, the pressures on migration will become less and the Australian immigration programme, looking at it from our point of view, will be more widely understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of these factors are: nutritional deficiencies, insanitary living conditions, overcrowding due to frequent pregnancies and the congregation of many members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> into 1 residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many immigrant families, consisting of man and wife or man, wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>, arrived in Australia during each oft he past five years; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The time is appropriate for a comprehensive inquiry not only into the DFRB but into the whole range of conditions of service which are under lire at the moment - into pay, moves and re-posting, re-settlement and re-establishment in civilian life, <span class="highlight">family</span> separation and disruption, housing, education, in short into the whole social environment of the serviceman and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few of the aspects are, firstly, the interest burden on the young married couple seeking a home - also the <span class="highlight">family</span> group, which is continuously having its interest burden increased; secondly, the cost of a home and land and the inadequate loans that are available; thirdly, spiralling land costs; fourthly, the inadequacy of the low cost housing provided by State Government authorities; and, fifthly, the fact that it is almost impossible because of finance difficulty for a young couple seeking to construct or purchase a dwelling to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government at that time agreed to meet three-fifths of the cost of rent rebates, which was designed to ensure that no low income <span class="highlight">family</span> would be required to pay more than one-fifth of its income for a government home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the subsidy could be extended to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> groups who 5 or 10 years ago entered into housing agreements and who now find their interest burden, with the encouragement of the Government, continuing to rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the emphasis from now on will have to be to ensure that the low wage earner - especially the low wage earner with a <span class="highlight">family</span> - and the young married couple will be given the precedence to enable him to purchase his own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think there was not a man on this side of the House who would not dissociate himself, as I dissociate myself, from any intrusion into a man’s private home and any intimidation of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has a young <span class="highlight">family</span>, as I have, and who realises how much time his children spend with their eyes and minds glued to the television apparatus must be aware of the tremendous influence this thing exercises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The benefit for <span class="highlight">family</span> men on comparable incomes is lower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a wife and 2 children with a taxable income of $3,000 receives a benefit of $32. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all this there is not the slightest pretence of equity, not the slightest attempt to distribute benefits according to need, nol the slightest effort to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the genuine middle income earner against the raids which the rest of the Budget makes on his standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, the table involves a number of assumptions, even guesses, about probable <span class="highlight">family</span> spending on the items taxed in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the conclusion is clear and it is this: Seventy per cent of Australian families are worse off because of the direct and immediate consequences of this Budget, and the poorer a <span class="highlight">family</span> is, the worse it is affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cb) Expenditure by income grade of survey items 23, 34, 35. lc) Assumption that average <span class="highlight">family</span> includes dependant wife and two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have made adjustments in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for married taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe a young couple with no children can put up with the noise, but when they become established and begin to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> they may find that the problem has completely changed for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, no increase would have been of any real or lasting benefit to the pensioner, to the lower income group or to the large <span class="highlight">family</span> unless the Government was prepared to take strong measures to control the strike-happy, power-drunk  Mr Hawke  and the militant left wing union leadership who are the real enemies of the pensioner, the superannuitant, the lower income group and particularly the primary producer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While 1 believe that the Government has done its best to bring down a Budget that overall is in the interests of the nation and that less emphasis should have been given to lower taxation and more emphasis placed on assistance to the pensioner and the man with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, I maintain that economic measures are not enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless irresponsible, power drunk, strike happy disruptionists are controlled and unless the control of unions is restored to the hands of the decent rank and file members then the purchasing power of the pensioner, the superannuitant, the lower wage earner and the man with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, together with the exporter of primary products and manufactured goods, will continue to deteriorate at an ever increasing rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is good reason for dismay and consternation over the Budget, particularly in the case of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and those persons on fixed and low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot recall when a <span class="highlight">family</span> man and those struggling to make ends meet were subjected to the type of confidence trick perpetrated by the Government in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ones most adversely affected will be those least able to pay - the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, people on fixed or low incomes and pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore every person and every <span class="highlight">family</span> in receipt of social services today will be worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are some of the areas of taxation where the Government could assist the low income earner, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and those people resident in country or remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a person whose income is the equivalent or approximately equivalent to that of an invalid pensioner with a wife and 4 dependant children, the increase in the cost structure which is caused through the increases in sales tax and other duties which the Government has introduced is $27.90 a year based on estimates of <span class="highlight">family</span> spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final matter with which I wish to deal specifically is the reduced amount of income available to most <span class="highlight">family</span> men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man suffers most, as tax allowances for dependants have not kept pace with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies even more to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man in the lower and middle income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the case of  Mr Semo-Tordjman  and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This case has been carefully considered by senior officers within my Department who have made very close contact with the <span class="highlight">family</span>, who have done so over the period since that <span class="highlight">family</span> has been here, and who are continuing to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice tendered to me by these senior officers, who have had considerable experience in the handling of social welfare cases, is that at this stage the facts do not justify the repatriation of that <span class="highlight">family</span> at Commonwealth expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the reasons for that recommendation are concerned, I am sure that the House would agree that it would not be appropriate to disclose the personal affairs of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> farm concept in Australia has tremendous merit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These duties strike at the very viability of the economic structure of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I pity the mother with a big <span class="highlight">family</span> who is compelled to remain at home, unable to go out and get a job, and who tries with all her might and main, to send her children off to school as tidily dressed and as well cared for as are children from other homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless he is in State housing accommodation his rent alone will mean that he cannot support his <span class="highlight">family</span> on anything approaching a decent standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such a budget would have reacted more savagely against the people whom that Party purports to represent - the worker, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the low income earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the amount of labour involved has a very direct bearing on this optimum size because it is one of our greatest problems in the country, ft would be hard to find, in my estimation, a more efficient working group than the single <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government - whichever government it is - should be warned against any precipitate move which would make it harder for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit to continue as the traditional, efficient labour unit in the pastoral and agricultural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party’s opposition to taxation in almost any form except way up the scales is often based, in terms of the specific example, on the low wage large <span class="highlight">family</span> complex, as it were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These young people who because of high home costs and shortage of housing must have a working wife and put off having our most valuable migrants, a <span class="highlight">family</span> born here, are going to pay more for their <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has largely been corrected in Holland by the appointment of a trustee to safeguard the income and assets of such a <span class="highlight">family</span> to see that they are properly applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am particularly concerned to see the end of inflation and the end to the use of the present blunt instruments being applied in vain to cure it - and this is not only because of the general effect on pensioners, on those on fixed income, on the lower income groups, and particularly on the young, newly married where there are the expenses of buying a home and of raising a <span class="highlight">family</span> with only one income coming into the household. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man, very often a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with children to keep at school, a wife to maintain and a house to rent or pay off, will face increases in sales tax and in the cost of a telephone - it will be $7 a year for him - which the Budget imposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During his speech the Leader of the Opposition made great play about a table which he said was a table which disclosed ‘Budget impact on <span class="highlight">family</span> income and spending’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not the Government of the Australian people who have a long tradition of commendable personal values of fair play, of giving a man a go, of look ing after the battler whether the battler is the young married couple trying to build a home for the future, the wage and salary earner struggling to raise and educate a <span class="highlight">family</span>, or the pensioner trying to establish security and human dignity - his right - in retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer has not provided one single measure aimed at encouraging families living in this country to bear the unjust taxation burden that grows progressively as the <span class="highlight">family</span> increases in size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party’s opposition to taxation in almost any form except way up the scales is often based in terms of the specific example, on the low wage large <span class="highlight">family</span> complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude they reveal is positive proof that the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, the wage earner, just does not rate in this Government’s estimation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should consider how costs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man have increased since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The promised reform that resulted in the illogical general 10 per cent tax cut on incomes under $10,000 is patchwork confusion tragically directed against the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In dealing with the matter to which I was referring last evening, the neglect in the Budget of families, it is fitting to mention the widower and the grave plight that he faces in his endeavour to educate and care for his <span class="highlight">family</span> without the help of his marriage partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me indicate the only changes that have been made since 1954 in the maximum deductions for dependent members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am going to work as never before to get my colleagues to accept this programme: First, we must have an end to the policies which still discourage savings and thrift and which make a breadline pension inevitable for numbers of Australians; secondly, we must have an end to the position where some people can bludge on the community, spend all their income on non-essentials and know that they will be just about as well off as a man who struggles to educate his <span class="highlight">family</span> and who saves only a few thousand dollars before retiring or whose superannuation is little if any better and is doomed to decline to the breadline; thirdly, we must face the fact that the vast majority of Australians do not want old people to suffer real poverty, no matter why they are in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite apart from medical and allied costs, however, a person with dependants will invariably have continuing <span class="highlight">family</span> and domestic expenses; accordingly, the fact he is in hospital will not affect for him the introduction of the higher rate of benefit in such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The calculation of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and <span class="highlight">family</span> groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case, an addition for rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Available resources include certain income and capital; the main national insurance and industrial injury benefits, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and maintenance payments from a husband on the father of the claimant’s children are taken into account in full but some part of all other resources is disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently I had drawn to my attention the problem of a migrant of 65 years of age who was receiving nothing from the Government because his <span class="highlight">family</span> was working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect with which I wish to deal specifically is the Government’s refusal to give any worthwhile assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> within the framework of social  services  Child endowment is one of the best ways in which to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> because it is paid irrespective of the income earned by that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is indicative of how the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been completely forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government apparently thinks that child endowment and the <span class="highlight">family</span> today are old hat, and yet the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the very basis of our community and these are the people whom we should be looking after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing is worse than for a woman with a young <span class="highlight">family</span> to be suddenly deprived of her husband, lt is a dreadful thing emotionally and economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has to bring up the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and she no longer has her partner to assist her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this should never at any stage be used as an excuse to refuse or to forget to look after those sections of the community which have not been able, because of the various economic, social and <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances involved, to look after themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost certain that the husband is either an invalid or unemployable, otherwise he would not be prepared to sit back and allow his <span class="highlight">family</span> to suffer because of the meagre allowances that this Government provides under the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With full employment and with inflation running at 3 per cent to 4 per cent a year our concern should now be for the low wage earner, especially the low wage earner with a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 3 or 4 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a married couple without children or with children able to look after themselves or with a relative nearby to assist the children and look after them on their return from school the wife can accept employment and thus supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income, but the low wage earner with a wife and children is not in this position and thus is worse off than his neighbour whose wife has been able to supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its place a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance should be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additional pension for children: Pensioners receive an extra  $2.50  per week for the first child under  16  (or between  16  and  21  if a student) in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and an extra  $3.50  for each subsequent such child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something which is rather contradictory and which has been built into the income tax structure is that the allowance made for <span class="highlight">family</span> and other concessions runs counter to the logic of social welfare payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if the father of one <span class="highlight">family</span> has an actual income of $3,000 and the other father has an actual income of 810,000 the tax concession to the first <span class="highlight">family</span>, the lower income <span class="highlight">family</span>, is worth $2.56 a week but to the second <span class="highlight">family</span>, the higher income <span class="highlight">family</span>, it is $5.17 a week which is almost double the first amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he splits that up amongst his <span class="highlight">family</span>, including himself, each member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> will have an extra 4c a week, which is not enough to buy anything - not even an icecream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the taxable income were $2,500, which would mean that the man was earning more than $60 a week, the proposed tax reductions would give each member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> the colossal increased spending power of 16c a week or. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet a further matter which is under close and active consideration is the effects of frequent reposting of servicemen in the form of <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption and interruption to children’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we had in mind was a comprehensive inquiry into the whole social enviroment of the serviceman and his <span class="highlight">family</span>; into pay; moves and reposting, re-settlement and reestablishment in civil life, <span class="highlight">family</span> separation and disruption, housing and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lack of understanding of what it means to be an officer, an NCO or a serviceman who has to move from State to State and from theatre to theatre, with consequent disruption of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, justified and long standing complaints  on  pay, housing, transfers, retirement and <span class="highlight">family</span> benefits have impaired many career servicemen’s assessment of their chosen profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By far the greatest proportion of programmes in <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time consisted of general entertainment from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although many of these programmes attract the young audience it is clear that in <span class="highlight">family</span> viewing time there are unused opportunities for developing a wider range of Australian programmes of both an entertaining and informative character to interest children and adolescents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, by citing the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> in my electorate which has already had one son undergo his national service training and is now faced with the prospect of the next 2 sons - twins - having been called up for national service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether he and the Government consider it to be just and equitable that one <span class="highlight">family</span> should be compelled, under the lottery system of selecting national servicemen, to supply 3 sons for the Army while thousands of families are never expected to provide even one son. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any provision in the National Service Act or any other Commonwealth statute or regulation which could be used to relieve the burden on this <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to have a reasonable standard of living nowadays, the husband has to have either 2 jobs or work a considerable amount of overtime, in addition to which his wife has to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the only way in which a <span class="highlight">family</span> can get a reasonable income in these times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This scheme was designed to ensure that no low income <span class="highlight">family</span> would be required to pay more than one-fifth of its income on a government home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To get a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 6 from Green Valley to the beach or the zoo and back takes most of a day, including half, a day’s travel by car or perhaps 2 days’ wages in’ fares and expenses … 60 per cent of Green Valley’s families have no car and 29 per cent have no wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must keep in mind that both husband and wife have to do this in these areas because, under the economic set-up of this Government, there have to be two breadwinners instead of one in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Victoria moved right out of the field of <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance as from 30th September 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they have some responsibility, particularly in the <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance field, for the provision of supplementary assistance because of the variation of expenses and variation of the facilities that are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is indeed unfortunate if they have a young <span class="highlight">family</span> of school age and they wish to travel interstate with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> counselling is required to show the people how they can overcome the pressures and the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are things such as housing for pensioners, more money per week for the lone property owner, the payment to surviving members of <span class="highlight">family</span> units, such as mother and daughter, or two sisters etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They should be encouraged to give of their wisdom and of the benefits that they have derived from a <span class="highlight">family</span> involvement and from all the lessons of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In places where the Aboriginals have been placed on the edge of the town in a block of houses on their own, almost invariably the housing has gradually decayed and the <span class="highlight">family</span> life has sunk to the lowest level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we believe that it will only be when the Commonwealth is prepared to approach this problem in a personal way that every Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia will have available to it the kind of personal services that are available to, say, repatriation beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be able to set up some system under which the agencies of the Commonwealth or the State are directed in such a way that every Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> is able to take advantage of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With my <span class="highlight">family</span> I drove to Jay Creek outside the Standley Chasm which is a famous tourist resort and saw there some appalling living conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He stays at school longer; he improves his educational status in the interests of peronal security; he may take out life assurance; he saves his money to secure his <span class="highlight">family</span>, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But she would never be accepted as one of their <span class="highlight">family</span> in the sense of marrying into the sort of community in which their daughter moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only are they human problems, they are tangled human problems, and I, for one, do not feel that we do right by our Aboriginal people by breaking up their <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though the matter was reported to all appropriate authorities, including the Registrar, the Commonwealth Police and the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department, the final solution came from the representatives of another country after  10  months of mental anguish to this young lady and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second cost which is a hidden cost is that students who have to live away from home, the vast majority being country students, come from home situations which usually include lower <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes and higher living costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made the observation that as a person becomes older it becomes increasingly difficult for him to fit into the Army system; it becomes increasingly hard upon his <span class="highlight">family</span>, his career, his employer and upon the society in which he is taking an increasingly important part if he has to spend 2 years in the national service system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am glad to be able to inform the honourable gentleman that the Government has decided to increase the eligibility limits for <span class="highlight">family</span> income in the subsidised medical scheme by $4 as a consequence of the decision to increase the minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of up to $46.50 a week will receive a full subsidy from the Government for its health insurance; those with an income of between $46.50 and $49.50 will receive a two-thirds subsidy; and those with an income of between $49.50 and $52.50 will receive a one-third subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot help but have the greatest admiration for a migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> who uproot themselves from the country of their birth and travel halfway around the world in search of a new and better life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three sections of the migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> are affected by this communication barrier: The breadwinner, the housewife and the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unfortunate thing is that when the <span class="highlight">family</span> comes home to the mother at night probably they all take the easy course of conversing in their own tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise that the disadvantaged migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia has a distrust of schools and a lack of knowledge about the aims and methods of teaching employed by teachers at schools which their children attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The factors which are considered are the circumstances of the particular offence for which the person was charged, the person’s antecedents which include his age, state of health, personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> history and any circumstances which may have any special bearing on the commission of this particular offence, past offences or the possibility of his committing further offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While he was a child his mother, along with the rest of his <span class="highlight">family</span>, suffered the anguish of worrying whether he would be able to leave hospital to lead a normal life after suffering the adverse effects of one of these drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is bad enough for the Army to interfere with the best years of this young man’s life and to cause anxiety to his mother and <span class="highlight">family</span>, but to deliberately rua the risk of placing his life in further medical danger is callous and inexcusable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the South Australian Government already is running at a deficit as a result of the actions of the Federal Government and the Federal Treasurer but has seen fit, because of the urgency of the situation and in the interests of preserving human life and preventing <span class="highlight">family</span> suffering, to recognise that it cannot continue to permit the Eyre Highway to take such a tragic toll of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister did not have the decency or the courage to place the matter before his Cabinet colleagues on compassionate grounds so that Cabinet could look at this particular case on its merits and see the effect the call-up would have on this widow and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet it is well known that if a man wants to keep his <span class="highlight">family</span> in a reasonable state and wants to sec his children educated the best contribution he can make is to send his wife out to work, and that is what is happening across the nation at the present lime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a common impression among the public in general - and this has in some cases been engendered by sections of the Press - that every time they see a Commonwealth car it is some politician or his <span class="highlight">family</span> going for a joy ride at the taxpayers’ expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A man in my electorate whose home has been seized and whose livelihood has been destroyed seems to me to.be, with his wife and young <span class="highlight">family</span>, the victim of monstrous official oppression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without warning men employed by the New South Wales Government rapped on his door, handed him a document, told him that his home had been resumed by the New South Wales Government and that from that moment he was no longer the owner but a tenant and that within 3 weeks he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> must be out with all their possessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  home is, or was, a quiet holiday guest house and he was further notified that from that day onwards he must have no more guests nor even any visitors to see him or his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thus  Mr Home  and his <span class="highlight">family</span> have since been permitted - as an act of grace, mark you - but subject to extraordinary prohibitions on his rights as a citizen, restrictions which cannot be linked by any stretch of the imagination with legitimate forestry purposes, to stay in the home until the end of this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second point is that  Mr Home’s  prosperous business has been destroyed overnight and he is without means now of providing for his <span class="highlight">family</span> except by selling his furniture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and 1 will not ascribe the motives animating those  who  ordered this extraordinary treatment of a citizen and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be thought that the  non-payment of a benefit for one child for a few weeks would not mean much of a loss to a <span class="highlight">family</span> if sickness is not retcurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but with the extension of the school leaving age it is not impossible for two or more children over 16 years of age in one <span class="highlight">family</span> to be receiving full-time education, yet if sickness overtakes that <span class="highlight">family</span> such students are not taken into account in determining the amount of benefit the <span class="highlight">family</span> should receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They eat as much as adults and it costs as much to clothe them as adults, but they are not recognised as dependants and this imposes a double penalty on the <span class="highlight">family</span> because in calculating the amount of benefit payable in respect of children, those children’ above .16 years of age are not considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, when wheat is produced in Australia and goes into the custody of the Wheat Board, an advance payment is made which enables the grower to buy the goods and services that he wants for next year’s crop and to maintain his <span class="highlight">family</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this type of attitude is not an unusual one, for in the case of a widowed mother who left a country reserve because her <span class="highlight">family</span> was growing up and faced no prospect of employment, the departmental attitude was: She had accommodation on the reserve so why did she leave? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mindful of the effects on Sunday employment and anxious to preserve the concept of Sunday as a <span class="highlight">family</span> day when worship and recreation can go hand-in-hand, we have sought to have legislation enacted to protect employees from being forced to work on Sundays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In listening to the comments and in accepting the broadness of the subjects mentioned at this time of the parliamentary year, I would like to say that with all the talk about the needy in the community perhaps there is no more needy and no more critical area in our social situation than that of the young widow with a small <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were: That large numbers of Australian farmers should be helped off their farms; that company ownership would tend to replace <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprises; that a farm mortgage loan insurance scheme should be introduced; that there should be higher interest rates to ensure that any loans that are made are not made at an uneconomic level - I think that was the term - and that land values should not rise; that there should be support for rural reconstruction boards; and that the so-called hopeless cases should be helped to sell their properties at what the Government’s report called normal market values’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say only this in conclusion: It is to be hoped that we will not have to wait too long before having an inquiry because, as the Minister well knows, not only is the Navy involved in this, not only is the boy involved in this, but also the <span class="highlight">family</span> is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similar distances and (without weekly concession tickets) even higher fares separate them from most friends and relations they’d like to visit, and from the pleasures and services of the city centre which is more than an hour each way and more than a dollar return … To get a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 6 from Green Valley to the beach or the zoo and back takes most of a day, including half a day’s travel by car or perhaps 2 day’s wages in fares and expenses . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the following points: Firstly, large numbers of Australian farmers are to be helped off their farms; secondly, company ownership will tend to replace the <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise; thirdly, higher rates of interest will ensure that loans are not made to uneconomic farmers and that land values will not rise; fourthly, the socalled hopeless cases are to be helped to sell their properties at what are called normal market values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to my far sighted friends in the metropolis: Sad will be the day when the countryside is deserted and sold, when the money lenders’ auctioneers have disposed of it around the world and  Mrs City  relies on the decisions of the board rooms of New York, London, Tokyo and other capitals for the daily bread of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the long term survival of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm in Aus-, tralia is dependent to a large extent on its ability in the future to obtain and manage capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we think of the Kormilda College and of the Yirara College at Alice Springs, which is the subject of the present motion, we ought to have regard to the fact that, in contrast to the conditions that prevail in the rest of Australia, the preponderance of young Aboriginal people will be taken away from their <span class="highlight">family</span> if they desire to undergo higher education, that is, education beyond the age of 12 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that, if one deliberately set about a policy of assimilation, one could not go about it more effectively than by arranging to take the children away from their <span class="highlight">family</span> at a certain age, to take them away from their tribal customs, to take them some hundreds of miles and for some years put them in a place in isolation from their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the attitudes of the Aborigines themselves to normal concepts of hygiene, the implications of the life style which most Aborigines choose to follow and the absence of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning leading to the inadequate spacing of children are significant contributing factors to the Infant Mortality Rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From my discussions at the General Assembly with delegates from various countries, if I remember correctly, there was not one who did not agree that here was the first case in history where a country set down its own conditions for admittance to the United Nations by saying: ‘I will become a member of this great <span class="highlight">family</span> of nations provided you meet my requirements’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The thought that is occupying the minds of those who are looking for a compromise is that Taiwan may have its own seat in the United Nations, not specifically for its own islands but that it may build up a small <span class="highlight">family</span> of islands under the control of the Nationalist Chinese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has lost much of its relevance because so many of its members have so little in common, except in some instances a desire to use meetings arranged pursuant to the elaborate fiction that they are <span class="highlight">family</span> gatherings as occasions for vituperative recrimination against other members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By and large, our discourse in the international field will be better conducted if we discard the shibboleth that all members of the Commonwealth have meaningful <span class="highlight">family</span> ties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These same peaceful protesters may have saved us from being cast out of the Olympic <span class="highlight">family</span>; I believe we are after all to be invited to participate in the next Olympic Games. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the only way we can bring the People’s Republic of China, mainland China, into the <span class="highlight">family</span> of nations is to recognise only the government of that country - and this is not to say that we are going to recognise any forceful takeover of Taiwan - then we must make this difficult choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have absolutely and unqualified sympathy for any honourable member who needs to go and do something for his <span class="highlight">family</span> life or his <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs, but no other consideration should prevent our being in our place in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an honourable member wants a hotel room for himself or a house for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, it should be there for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a serious reflection on Australian national life that in the 40odd years the Parliament has been in Canberra no serious consideration has been given to the <span class="highlight">family</span> life of honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have families to go to and it is only human to see that their <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs are attended to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have I day at home with my <span class="highlight">family</span> and that is usually on Saturday because the children play football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree very fully as a rule with the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Jess)  but on this occasion he made a sensible point when he said that the civil service and our own secretaries and other people involved do not work on Saturday or Sunday and, therefore, if an honourable member tried to go home for a short weekend, as is the case under this system, he would not have a great deal of success in pursuing his electoral business apart from catching up with his <span class="highlight">family</span> or public engagements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet it was this Government which sabotaged the Statistician’s proposed <span class="highlight">family</span> expenditure surveys which could improve this index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reflects not a justifiable concern for the welfare of <span class="highlight">family</span> farms impoverished through no fault of their owners, but the servitude of the Minister for Trade and Industry to large scale and corporate farming interests and the servitude of the Prime Minister to the banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great pastoral properties often owned not by individuals but by companies will receive assistance they do not need while <span class="highlight">family</span> farms are denied assistance without which they cannot survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Prime Minister acknowledged at least one of the most pressing problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Prime Minister knew, perhaps from his own experience, that <span class="highlight">family</span> farms cannot survive without proper access to long term, fair interest finance, and he promised therefore in his opening speech in the Senate election campaign that the Government would establish a rural finance insurance corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm for those who value it by providing alternative sources of income within easy reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitudes to <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare, almost not mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, in view of his adoption of a new, strange <span class="highlight">family</span> code at Launceston, are well understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the attitudes to <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare are also real in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> code policies enunciated at Launceston, according to which the natural addition to the Australian work force following some second-rate left wing overseas intellectual proposition is to be reduced, he desires to increase immigration from non-European sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have produced instead a scheme which will help the rich get richer and the struggling <span class="highlight">family</span> wool grower will receive practically no benefit at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that in low rainfall western areas the Minister is giving the <span class="highlight">family</span> wool grower the kiss of death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> wool grower may receive a few hundred dollars while the pastoral finance companies to whom he is in debt will receive, in some cases, $100,000 direct from the Government for sheep they own, and they may decide that the <span class="highlight">family</span> grower on their books will receive none of the money due to him personally; they may decide to retain it and apply it with the rest of their profits to buying up ice cream firms in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no guarantee that the <span class="highlight">family</span> producer will receive very much at all from the subsidy payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them, young people particularly, have the problem of bringing up a <span class="highlight">family</span> at the same time as they are buying a house on terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the purchasing power of the people in the community - the pensioner, the superannuitant, the man with a large <span class="highlight">family</span> - is decreased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A nation-wide network of clinics to provide free advice by experts on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, including contraception to anyone who so requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are proposals of the once great Labor Party on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This to me is a shocking thing when it is realised that a woman who has raised a <span class="highlight">family</span> cared for a home for many years and is getting on in years, suddenly finds herself in a position of having to look around for some work to augment the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The steepness of this increase certainly strikes at the whole community, and in particular the lower paid <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those families with fewer than 2 children it is not just another increased charge but a 100 per cent increase in a charge, an increase that the Government is asking the lower paid <span class="highlight">family</span> man to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that every <span class="highlight">family</span> will appreciate the rise in the rate of child endowment for the third and subsequent children that this Budget provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> of 4 children now receives $5.75 a week in child endowment, and it may be as well to remember that child endowment itself is one of the many innovations in the field of social services that was made originally by a Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An estate agent related that a migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> came to inquire about the purchase of a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> appeared reluctant to answer the agent’s inquiry as to how much the <span class="highlight">family</span> earned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, he said, with reasonable tact: ‘You would need a weekly income of about $80 to buy a house’, to which the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> questioned: ‘Does anyone in Australia earn $80 a week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite will have no difficulty in answering the question of the head of that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of child endowment for the third and each subsequent child under 16 years in a <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be increased by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present child endowment is payable at the rate of 50c a week for the first child under 16 years in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, $1 a week for the second child, $1.50 for the third child, with cumulative increases of 25c a week for each subsequent child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child endowment is now an accepted feature of <span class="highlight">family</span> income and for some time the Government has been concerned that the larger <span class="highlight">family</span> has been more adversely affected by wage and price increases than the smaller <span class="highlight">family</span> with, say, one or two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wage increases which have to be spread over a greater number of dependants reduce the relative improvement in the position of the whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that at the present time an effective way of providing real benefits to the larger <span class="highlight">family</span> is by way of increased child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the proposal in the Bill before the House is to increase endowment for the third and each subsequent child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that the rate of endowment in respect of the third child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> will become  $2  a week, in respect of the fourth child $2.25 a week and so on, increasing by  25c  for each additional child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to families via the National Health Act where the <span class="highlight">family</span> insurance rates for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners, the last a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, a TPI pensioner with a wife and 2 children, who also receives a service pension, but with no other means, will receive a total <span class="highlight">family</span> increase of $5.12 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members now travel by plane and we can get home to our electorates each weekend not only for <span class="highlight">family</span> reasons - and they are very important reasons - but in order to look after other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was considered in view of other pressing demands on government construction funds, especially for houses to provide <span class="highlight">family</span> accommodation, that available resources should be directed more towards meeting the pressing needs of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is pressure for increased welfare benefits, social service benefits, repatriation benefits, assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and assistance to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man who would suffer about a $90 a year increase as a result of the impact of this Budget if he is unlucky enough to be going into a Housing Commission home today, with an average cost of the house and land of about $10,000, will be paying another $100 a year in interest or a total of $190 a year as a result of this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we have increased child endowment by 50c a week for each child under the age of 16 in excess of 2 in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that this mysterious and reluctant document will be resurrected and presented to this Parliament with the same degree of alacrity with which the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was restored to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One sees the drift of population from country towns and the closing down of <span class="highlight">family</span> stores that for many decades had been the sheet anchor of the rural community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Back in 1845 the explorer Eyre discovered that it was unusual to find an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> with more than 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children was rare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today it is not uncommon to find an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> with 6 or 7 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These families are desperately in need of health and hygiene education and education on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, ft has been reported that 50 per cent of Aboriginal children are under the age of 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably, deductions are allowed to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man to ensure that his tax burden in relation to that of a single man is not too onerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the deductions are adequate then the <span class="highlight">family</span> man’s tax burden over a period of time will not be increasing at a faster rate than the rest of the community’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it aggravated the difference in treatment between the single man and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the 21 per cent increase in personal tax once again adversely burdens the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man continues to be burdened in an unfair manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But only the most distorted analysis of these increases could suggest that they actually benefit the <span class="highlight">family</span> by providing more than totally inadequate cost of living adjustments in endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I pay some tribute to the people who work day and night, who give up their <span class="highlight">family</span> life and go out arranging meetings to form Party branches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can produce a new motor car for every <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia probably every 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> group would be very lucky as it would qualify for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figure for the <span class="highlight">family</span> group of a husband, wife and 2 children was given as $49.91 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> group would qualify, but it would not qualify for the full assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> group of a husband, wife and 3 children would need to have an income of $52.56 a week to be on a very stringent poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, a <span class="highlight">family</span> group earning that income, which it must earn to be just above the poverty line, would be immediately placed beyond eligibility for this subsidised health insurance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> group in Victoria of a husband, wife and 4 children would need $59.86 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> group of a husband, wife and 5 children on $67.44 would have no hope of qualifying under this scheme, nor would the <span class="highlight">family</span> group of a husband, wife and 6 children on $74.97 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen that any <span class="highlight">family</span> group in Victoria of a husband, wife and 3 or more children would be receiving such income that they would not be eligible for assistance under this subsidised medical scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> could then be allowed to earn $4 a week for every child after the second child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the dropping out of employment of married women would not show up in the figures of the recipients of benefits it would very seriously affect the economy of the area and of the families concerned because the income of these women has become a part of the normal income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the spending rates and standards of living have been geared accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include low income, lack of aspiration and motivation, which is a generational sort of thing and will continue within those <span class="highlight">family</span> groups pretty much unless we do something to improve opportunities for these people, and also retention rates for secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members well know there are fairly generous concessional deductions allowable for a <span class="highlight">family</span> such as medical, hospital and education expenses as well as life assurance payments but what the taxpayers do not generally realise is the way that these falls result in a massive transfer from low and moderate income earners to high income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the financial year 1968-69 $805m was allowed as deductible claims for <span class="highlight">family</span> purposes involving medical, hospital and educational expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the child deductibility allowance, where there is a <span class="highlight">family</span> of a man, his wife and 3 children, and he receives a salary of $2,700 a year, he will gain a tax saving of about $99; whereas the man with a salary of $16,000 a year will gain a saving of $406 on his tax payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has given high priority to the one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can never assess the importance of having a mother at home to look after her young <span class="highlight">family</span> when they arrive home from school and I do feel this is perhaps the most important aspect of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might mention that this is not the position in the Asian countries where it is a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s responsibility to care for the parents and other relatives, and to me they appear to be much happier for the experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they were happy to share what they had with the other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was prepared to share his house and what he had with other members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and was held in respect and, no doubt, loved for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Government had the revenue to provide our elderly citizens with everything they need and accepted full responsibility for them, they would be missing something vital - that is that warm, human, personal and friendly touch that only members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more happy and satisfactory life for our senior citizens, invalids, TPIs and so on can come about only as a partnership where members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> must accept a greater responsibility along with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it bluntly, tax rates for <span class="highlight">family</span> taxpayers are so low at that point that the individual tax saving is negligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That appeared to me to be a very old fashioned and anachronistic sort of attitude, and it is not just distressing, it is absolutely appalling to find that that is still the situation today, except for pensioners with children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the suggestions that we should abolish or reduce some of the taxation concessions I wonder whether the honourable member for Perth realises that most of these concessions were introduced to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, particularly the man with a large <span class="highlight">family</span> who is on a low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child endowment is designed to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> - to encourage Australians to have larger families and to populate our country with the best migrants we can have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child endowment, a measure first introduced by the Liberal-Country Party Government as was generously recognised by the honourable member for Sydney  (Mr Cope),  has been increased for third and subsequent children, so that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children receives a total income supplement of $2.50 a week while a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children receives $5.75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When wage increases have to be spread ‘ over a greater number of dependants the relative improvement of the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, the rate of child endowment for the third and each subsequent child under 16 years of age in a <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be increased by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was impressed with the matter brought forward by the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Reid),  who spoke about the need for members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> to look after and care for aged parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an allowance were given, these people could be looked after in their own home under normal <span class="highlight">family</span> conditions and in  a  more satisfactory and happy atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Holt said, in many instances eastern countries can show us <span class="highlight">family</span> care and respect for aged people which many of us would benefit by copying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health insurance rates for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable for a married couple without children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the increase in child endowment this time applies only in cases where there are more than 2 children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> and as the amount is only 50c, at a time when the Government places emphasis on children’s needs, it must be pretty obvious that any increase daring the next 4 years or so will be very small indeed, if there is any increase at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that parents with large families are not being assisted to the extent that they should be and that in turn the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> is suffering in the areas of health and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">family</span> - including the aged, invalids and widows - needs them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man with the same <span class="highlight">family</span>, who is on the minimum wage now, pays $2.85 per week or $148.20 a year in income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1949 child endowment paid to a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children - which is close to the number of children in the average <span class="highlight">family</span> - represented 11.3 per cent of the average male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Budget, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children will receive $3.50  a  week in child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1948 when the minimum wage was $11.60 a week, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 5 children received $4 a week in child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same sized <span class="highlight">family</span> now receives $8.25 a week, but the minimum wage is now $46.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To retain the same relationship child endowment now should be over $11 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 5 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The recent Budget was not a <span class="highlight">family</span> budget by any stretch of the imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt is interesting to analyse how the <span class="highlight">family</span> income shrinks as extra children come along. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This reduces the <span class="highlight">family</span> income to $42.15, or $21.08 a week each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The couple receive 50c a week child endowment, which gives the <span class="highlight">family</span> $43.40 a week, or $14.47 each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> income is now $44.95 a week, or $11.24 each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the third child, tax paid weekly is $2.40 and child endowment is $3.50 a week, leaving the <span class="highlight">family</span> income at $47.40, or $9.48 for each unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the fourth child taxation is reduced to $1.95 each week and child endowment is $5.75 a week, making the <span class="highlight">family</span> income $50.10, or $8.35 for each unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that the bigger the <span class="highlight">family</span> the less each <span class="highlight">family</span> unit has to live on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect on the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget when the first child reaches the age of 16 years is most noticeable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, 1 have an interjection from the Opposition’s shadow Minister for Health based on his own <span class="highlight">family</span> code policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret very much that, as the very basis for the determination of a social welfare policy, the Opposition has adopted policies with respect to Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> codes and immigration, which is itself an addition to the work force, which run counter to every tradition that we have had in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment and mothers allowance together, for the first child there is an extra payment of $9 and if there is more than one child it is about $7 per child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had some cognisance of <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities and this is a measure of the improvement which we have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that in a 5-year period, a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 5 Australians sharing one <span class="highlight">family</span> car would be paying about $1,000 towards the expense of injury producing car smashes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also showed that after taking into consideration the accommodation costs of the persons concerned, their assets and the <span class="highlight">family</span> help they received, only one in fifty was in poverty and in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of the survey, which was carried out in the June Quarter 1966, the poverty line for a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> comprising husband, wife and two dependent children was arbitrarily set at $33 per week, that being equivalent to the then Victorian basic wage of $30.70 per week plus child endowment for two children plus a loading of 80 cents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The updated poverty line for a standard <span class="highlight">family</span> as calculated from Victorian average weekly earnings for the June Quarter 1971, would accordingly be $49.18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the June 1966 base is updated according to increases in the Consumer Price Index for Melbourne to June 1971, the poverty line for the standard <span class="highlight">family</span> would be $38.63. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that this <span class="highlight">family</span> was ordered out of Honolulu by the Hawaiian Government and has refused repatriation back to the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, as  Mr O’Leary  and his <span class="highlight">family</span> now appear to be illegal immigrants will the Minister state the full facts of the case and what action, if any, is being taken by his Department in relation to this remarkable one-man unassisted mass migration programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is in relation to the willingness of die United States authorities to repatriate the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the second is in relation to whether it is correct that the American authorities paid the fares of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the problem here is that each flat, being occupied by one <span class="highlight">family</span> or person, would be regarded the same as a house and so naturally the tenant of each flat al one address would be obliged to have a licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish now to deal with the increase in prescription costs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 50c to $1 as this is another strike at the <span class="highlight">family</span> - the very section of our community whom we should be helping and not hindering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, this is another assault upon the <span class="highlight">family</span> which will particularly affect my electorate which, as I mentioned earlier, probably has the youngest average population in Australia and has more couples bringing up the future generation of this country than most other areas, and I submit that a part of this Budget surplus should be used to reduce the cost of prescriptions to the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think most people will appreciate that any person who is bringing up a <span class="highlight">family</span> in circumstances where, for example, in the case of a widow pensioner the husband has died possibly at an early age because of a heart attack or something of that nature, the widow is placed in a most invidious and difficult position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet under the social service framework instituted by this Government the woman is almost invariably forced to go out to work to keep her <span class="highlight">family</span> at a time when her responsibilities within the home and her need to be in the home are greater than they ever were before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the time has come when, in the interests of humanity and in the interests of those young children who have to be brought up with the attendant requirements of education and the rest, the pension for a civilian widow with a <span class="highlight">family</span> should be immediately reviewed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is equally applicable to the invalid pensioner who has a <span class="highlight">family</span> to bring up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It applies also to the age pensioner and the widow who does not have a <span class="highlight">family</span> but it applies particularly to the civilian widow with a <span class="highlight">family</span> and the invalid pensioner with a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In trying &lt;o understand this Budget, we in opposition are convinced that in endeavouring to deflate the economy, which seems to be the only alternative that this Government has in mind to combat inflation, the wage earner and the <span class="highlight">family</span> are the real victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I instance for example the Jewish <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare organisation in Melbourne, which has been interesting itself in this field, but lately this matter has taken on a new dimension by reason of the pioneering work done by Alderman Joan Pilone and the City Council in Sydney in the establishment of the Beehive Industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, as the means test at present victimises large families who need a larger income to be above the poverty line than the means test allows, will he broaden the means test to take account of differing incomes needed for differing <span class="highlight">family</span> sizes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is it in a land such as ours that young people are unable to acquire a block of land at a price within their economic means, to build a house and to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This demand for land arises from the basic human need for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to have a decent place in which to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These prices do not include the high interest charges which are fixed by this Government and which are inevitably forced on the average land buyer because his income is not enough to enable him to -accumulate enough capital to have a house of his own in which to rear his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the circumstances of a withdrawal from Vietnam - that means a great reduction in the Australian commitment overseas - and in the realisation that the people in time of peace will be more reluctant to accept sacrifices in their own personal lives, in their association with other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and in their business interests and the like, than they would be in time of war, the Government has decided to reduce the term of national service from 2 years to IS months and is proposing to make certain other adjustments to the National Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has taken all reasonable steps to reduce disruption to the careers of national servicemen by deferring call-up until completion of studies or on <span class="highlight">family</span> hardship grounds, and by guaranteeing restoration in civil employment on completion of service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsection name is different for husband, wife, sons and daughters and does not identify the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the way a European surname does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, since the Commonwealth Government provides 50 trees and shrubs for every <span class="highlight">family</span> it brings to Canberra, why is similar provision not made for families which it transfers to Army bases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problems will not easily be overcome, for they require the improvement of living conditions and the extension of medical and health knowledge and understanding amongst Aboriginal parents including increased voluntary use of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Dr Callaghan  said in Cootamundra quite recently, you can do what you like about birth control and you can do what you like about <span class="highlight">family</span> planning but there will be many more millions of people in the world in the next 20 years and at our present rate of food production we will not be able to supply them with food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As some 20 million refugees and displaced persons are today facing acute problems of hunger and privation - nutrition and child <span class="highlight">family</span> problems- ultimate famine and death on an unprecedented scale- the Commonwealth Government must plan to come to their assistance in a more sacrificial way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lastly, as I have mentioned, the newspaper article is headed ‘Labor Favors 2-Child <span class="highlight">Family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are finding is that many males’ in Australia simply could not afford to lead a <span class="highlight">family</span> on the means test involved in this system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> income is below $52.51 a week, the plan gives special help in paying health expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 3 categories of assistance: Firstly, where a <span class="highlight">family</span> income is $46.50 or less, free medical benefits and public ward hospital cover are available; secondly, where a <span class="highlight">family</span> income is above $46.50 but does not exceed $49.50, medical benefits and public ward hospital cover are available for only one-third of the normal cost of health insurance contributions; and thirdly, where a <span class="highlight">family</span> income is above $49.50 but does not exceed $52.50 medical benefits and public ward hospital cover are available for two-thirds of the normal cost of health insurance contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any <span class="highlight">family</span> with at least one dependant with a taxable income below $1,730 would be automatically exempted from contributing but would have full access for free public or standard ward hospital treatment and for medical services from a private doctor of the patient’s choosing, Importantly, those most luckless of all Australians - the Aborigines - would be fully covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A matter which is a worry to many people in Australia, especially the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, is the cost of health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that there is a need to provide special finance for <span class="highlight">family</span> units so that families can extend their homes by the building of self-contained in-law units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By this means there may be a tendency in our community to get back to the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me reiterate that the only means of including every citizen within a single insurance scheme is to have a single compulsory, universal insurance scheme that levies charges on the pay packet according to the ability to pay and with generous exemptions according to <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, even supposing every low income <span class="highlight">family</span> eligible for Government assistance was involved in the Government subsidised scheme, the fundamental questions would still remain: What sort of care do such families require, and are these needs being met? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is supposed to be progressive in its application, to be levied according to people’s capacity to pay and takes into account certain circumstancial differences between taxpayers by reason of <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments and other sorts of allowances that have from time to time been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also means that when a man does increase his earnings by individual effort he is able to keep for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> a fairly big proportion of this increase without the state taking an undue proportion of it away from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be effective in assisting families this concession should be given in the form of a fixed rebate of total taxation for all <span class="highlight">family</span> people and not be specifically designed to give a concession which increases with the wealth of the individual recipient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I am not at all happy with the present method of offering <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance or concession and am of the opinion that a straight forward allowance of direct taxation deduction irrespective of income would be a much more equitable and acceptable system, but even this would not help those people who, because of their circumstances, pay next to nothing in tax in any case and yet who at the same time are the very people who require assistance for the education of their children or to ensure their good health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course when there are 2 children in each <span class="highlight">family</span>, or 3 or 4, then the man with a higher income gets an even greater advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a fixed amount of deduction for a wife and a <span class="highlight">family</span>, for education, for medical expenses and the like, because it is not fair that the person on a low income should not receive the same benefit as a person on a higher income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that the Budget has added more than $2 weekly to the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man’s cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a <span class="highlight">family</span> nowadays to have a reasonable standard of living the husband has either to have 2 jobs or to work considerable overtime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone has a lot of sympathy for a mother of 2 or 3 school age children if the husband does not work overtime and the <span class="highlight">family</span> depends only on his wage rate for the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With this Government’s constant rattling of the war drums in its determination to confront the trade union movement, to force strikes upon the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who can ill afford them, it is in an atmosphere of extreme despair that some of the building workers in Western Australia are considering a strike meeting next week in an attempt to determine what action they can take, such as the banning of overtime or voluntary short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present that <span class="highlight">family</span> group receives 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and when the increase is granted it will receive 32.8 per cent of average weekly earnings, a percentage lower than that applicable in 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the reasons why the present unemployment situation has arisen is because companies, like Broken Hill Pty Co.

    <p>A decision to leave the business of farming is not just like a decision to choose another job because, in many cases, it is a decision which will affect the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> and, in most cases the whole way of life to which it has been accustomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it can be argued that federally the Commonwealth has no direct interest in farm quotas nevertheless indirectly farm quotas have raised some important national problems because the economic problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm enterprise in Australian agriculture can be expected to be given greater political priority now that farm quotas have spread to the wheat industry on virtually a permanent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the survival of the <span class="highlight">family</span> - I say this very sincerely - and the survival of the farm are at stake and the bank manager is saying: ‘You had better sell or sign up’ the wheatgrower has to look at his home first, particularly when he knows that the Government is wrong and will not admit it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to protect farms of an economic size surely we must admit - if honourable members do not know this they ought to - that an economic <span class="highlight">family</span> farm in today’s conditions will always beat the corporate farm because it has a great many advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion let me point out also, that there is not much incentive to the Australian worker to pay extra taxes from long hours of overtime in order to exclude himself and <span class="highlight">family</span> from benefits for which they have toiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minis  ter whether it is a fact that he revealed on Tuesday night that he had not been consulted on the speech in which the Treasurer speculated about a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In directing my question to the Treasurer I refer to his address to the Federated Taxpayers Association in which he implied that a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit scheme of taxation was a possible course of action, although he later withdrew it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of some of the comments which I shall make later criticising this Government very strongly I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  on standing firm on the question of a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit tax and putting the blame completely on the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it ought to be pointed out for the record that the Wilson <span class="highlight">family</span> is associated with the Aged Cottage Homes Inc. in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought to be encouraging families to hold together the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that I have moved away from the position which I once held about the individuality of groups in society and the less desirable features of the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the problems and tensions we are moving into today in our society demand that we take steps to hold the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> unit together, more especially with mothers working at the high rate at which they do today as a result of Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this situation we ought to be providing money on very easy terms so that self-contained inlaw units can be built onto homes so that the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship can be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The quality of the education a child receives is determined not by his own capacity to learn by by his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s capacity to earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe the Commonwealth should now see that pre-school, primary, secondary and tertiary eduction of not less than an agreed standard is provided for every young Australian irrespective of the income his <span class="highlight">family</span> receives, the church they attend or the locality they inhabit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one wants to compensate a child from a poor <span class="highlight">family</span> to provide an equal opportunity in life, one must discriminate in his favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this is typical of a number of other social attitudes that they adopt in which they suggest that the State can replace <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ths  would lead to what could become  a  breakdown in traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average rural <span class="highlight">family</span> is larger than its urban counterpart and this again places a heavier burden on the isolated parent who must find finance for boarding children in order to give them access to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A child from a culturally under-privileged <span class="highlight">family</span> has less starting opportunity than have normal children and therefore requires greater encouragement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation where a child of 16, 17 or 18 years who is starting to become a very expensive luxury for any <span class="highlight">family</span> is trying to cope with an adolescent life with the normal costs of living at that age and obtaining an education on a basic income available to his <span class="highlight">family</span> of something less than $40 a week and, quite often, something substantially less than $30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great weaknesses of the public services of Australia and many of the large private commercial concerns such as banks has been the arbitrary and capricious way in which people are shunted off around the country, <span class="highlight">family</span> life and everything else notwithstanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Four months ago I asked the honourable gentleman whether he had studied the New Zealand system of capitalising a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s child endowment as a grant towards the cost of a house and whether he had calculated the annual cost of making a similar provision in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when the low income farmer can do little other than leave the industry with a significant capital loss and illequipped to earn other income to house and provide for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, this is an injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to say a few words in respect of that matter, but first let me say that it is an extremely evil thing to apply vicious death duties on the estate of a farmer whose son, daughter, wife and the other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> have worked and slaved to make the farm an economic proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the Government should have taken steps long ago to ensure that synthetic meat or imitation meat - call it what you like - would not be an attractive commodity to the Australian housewife and her <span class="highlight">family</span> or consumers of meat in Australia generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have explained in my Budget Speech that these increases in dependants allowances, together with the reductions in income tax proposed by the Bill I have already introduced, are directed to easing the tax burdens of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am talking specifically about these low income <span class="highlight">family</span> groups earning $51.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my electorate a man with an income of $65 a week, with 7 children, the eldest of whom is 10, is in debt for over $1,000 through just keeping his <span class="highlight">family</span> surviving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the scheme he is punished because he is trying to raise a large <span class="highlight">family</span> on a low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the eyes of the Federal Government he should be able to live and try to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 7 children on $65 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition a further grant of up to $250 per annum will be payable subject to <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the maximum living allowances are paid when the adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income does not exceed $3,100 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the calculation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> income a deduction of $450 for each dependent child other than the scholar will be allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this whole system there is no conception of assisting the child facing disaster because the breadwinner of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is dead, or ill, or has deserted the <span class="highlight">family</span>, or is an alcoholic or the <span class="highlight">family</span> is large or disadvantaged for any reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income level from $3,100 to $4,200 is also not much more than an as you were’ increase offset by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, my own <span class="highlight">family</span> has been a major beneficiary under that system and I realise all of its advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any reader of that speech would be led to the conclusion - as I believe .the audience was led to the conclusion - that all deductions for income tax purposes except <span class="highlight">family</span> concessions would be taken away by a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose this applies particularly to those children in a one-child <span class="highlight">family</span> - the only child or the first child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, I think these early mothering moments, if I may put it that way, when emotional ties are established and when the early development of the child in its social setting in relation to the <span class="highlight">family</span> is taking place, are very important indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer’s typical <span class="highlight">family</span> man - the average wage earner with a wife and 2 children - pays a higher proportion of his income in tax under the McMahon Government than under any government in Australia’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer said that his standard of reference was what he called the typical <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He had nothing to say, one notes, about the typical <span class="highlight">family</span> woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a citizen who must buy land, build a house or rent one, raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>, keep them and himself in health, travel to work, pay State charges, pay municipal charges, pay insurance charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The typical Australian today is, I profoundly believe, a man or woman who wants to believe that he or she lives in a society which is committed to achieving justice and equity and opportunity for all, not just for himself and his immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> but for all his fellow citizens, and who believes that he can and does contribute to achieving such a society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasingly, he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> depend on local government to provide a whole new range of basic services in health, welfare, sport, culture and recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of that sort of limited involvement is that a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a taxable income of $3,000 pays in New South Wales $1.24 a week for public ward cover, a man on $5,000 pays $1.06, while a man on $20,000 pays 5 lc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the time to put purchasing power in the hands of Australian families by restoring the value of child endowment or introducing <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a <span class="highlight">family</span> includes one young child or 4 young children, it is still a one-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the time to drop the frantic search for exploitable migrant labour, and being a programme of migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would the Australian Labor Party increase direct personal income tax, but it would also take away all deductions except the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, more tax concessions are given to fewer than onethird of the number - that is, those taxpayers earning over $4,000 a year - in respect of life insurance and superannuation than are given for all of the <span class="highlight">family</span> claims of taxpayers earning under $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore these reductions will be a stimulus to the economy and of great assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year they declined to 22 per cent, so there again there was no benefit we could sec for the small <span class="highlight">family</span> man whom the present Budget purports to be able to help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> man says: ‘If the Government offers me a bribe of $2 a week it will take $4 back from me because no increase is worth anything today unless there is price control.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me touch briefly on the <span class="highlight">family</span> swindle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average endowed <span class="highlight">family</span> represents 2.18 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949, the average amount of child endowment paid to a <span class="highlight">family</span> was $90; today it is $104. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it stands to reason - it is almost commonsense - that the majority of <span class="highlight">family</span> men on $10,000 a year are not going to rush out and spend it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, I am talking about a <span class="highlight">family</span> man on $10,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there has been the fear of inadequate security for retirement, illness, the education of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and the provision of a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> of 5 - that is, with 3 children - have, in addition to the benefits and entitlements of all Australian citizens, an average expenditure on them of $1,850. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like all other groups within our widening society, we welcome their participation and their political aspirations as part of a <span class="highlight">family</span>, not as aliens holding the nation to ransom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told that it will wipe out all taxation deductions other than for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances - that is, all education allowances, insurance allowances, medical allowances and expenses in earning income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a wife and 2 children, receiving $5,000 a year, is to receive a tax reduction of $141 a year, yet he is alleged to be getting a princely benefit of a 17.6 per cent reduction -  2i  times the percentage but only one-third of the amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there were hopes of getting something going but it is a matter of time and there is <span class="highlight">family</span> hardship where the banks have decided to close down by saying that there would be no more money and where cheques have been dishonoured despite the fact that the growers concerned are owed large sums of money for fruit which they produced, harvested and delivered and which has been put in cans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not denied the Minister’s charge that the Labor Party would wipe out all taxation deductions other than <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Income tax at present rates has been placing too heavy a burden on the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, but under this Budget the <span class="highlight">family</span> man will benefit very considerably in a variety of ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the same size receives in child endowment a sum which is less than 4 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the revised scale of tax deductions issued with the Budget papers a man on the minimum wage of $51, with a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the same number, will pay $2.36 a week or $132.98 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Inadequate, almost nonexistent urban planning by free enterprise governments, whose sympathies lie more with the developers than with those they are supposed to serve, has led to a chaotic urban bungle that is slowly destroying the fabric of <span class="highlight">family</span> and social life within our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the contrary, the very nature of retirement to a new area entails leaving <span class="highlight">family</span> ties and life-long friendships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Estate duty has broken up many a <span class="highlight">family</span> property which has been run efficiently for generations to the great advantage of the nation, the district and the people in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another thing that has benefited the primary producer tremendously, particularly the primary producer who wants to hand over to his <span class="highlight">family</span> property that he has gained and built up Over the years by sheer hard work - incidentally, he paid taxes on any income earned - and who then has found that he is unable to provide for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, has been the relaxation of gift duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, although the Treasurer is correct in asserting that the percentage reductions in the amount of income tax payable are significant to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man on a low income, once again the greatest beneficiaries are those on higher incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in practice it is most difficult to tell a man that he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> must sell their house and get out of one area and go to another area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these days of intense living one never knows when a husband may be struck down at a comparatively early age, leaving his wife with a great economic problem and with more than twice the responsibility - I say deliberately, more than twice the responsibility - for bringing up her <span class="highlight">family</span> than she had before her husband’s death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No woman could be expected to stay at home, where she should be with her added responsibilities of parenthood - I stress the words ‘added responsibilities’ - and bring up her <span class="highlight">family</span> on that amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Budget also does nothing to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> by way of increases in child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can Government supporters then say that this is a <span class="highlight">family</span> Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it that the Government wishes to perpetuate the socially wrong concept that each <span class="highlight">family</span> must have 2 incomes and not one to survive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dependants’ allowances are a means we use to make more equitable the tax burden as between persons on the same income but in different <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the increase in dependants’ allowances will be widely welcomed and will help particularly the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since I can remember, which is quite a few years now, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the taxpayer in the poorest circumstances have, upon a measurement of the financial circumstances, made the greatest contribution to the revenue of this country, have carried the greatest burden and have been treated most unfairly in relation to taxation, both direct and indirect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, the method which the Government has decided to use on this occasion in relation to alterations in the taxation scale has further aggravated and further reduced the living standard of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the man on the lower income as measured against those without families or in comfortable or wealthy circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the reduction in percentage is greater, but in actual money, which means actual relief - it is actual money that buys food and clothing, not percentages - It is the low income groups and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who get the worst deal and who in fact have been treated very shabbily in this Budget compared with those on very high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it amounts to only $67 a year or 21c a week per person of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That taxpayer will enjoy a tax reduction of 9.1 per cent, which in actual money amounts to $646 a year, or $2.07 a week per person of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who suffers most from increases in the cost of living, and the larger his <span class="highlight">family</span> the more he suffers - not only financially but also in a general way, because it is a great strain and worry to him if he is unable to provide his children with the start in life to which every child should be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is too lazy, too unconcerned or too incompetent to trouble itself about working out a system or formula for giving the <span class="highlight">family</span> man a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of ways by which the <span class="highlight">family</span> man could and should be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could be spent towards the welfare of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also would be real assistance in a financial way and could remove much of the worry and burden which <span class="highlight">family</span> taxpayers carry at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be far better to stop immigration immediately, except to those people who have guaranteed employment or who are <span class="highlight">family</span> dependents and do not affect in any way those persons who are in employment already, who are reuniting a <span class="highlight">family</span>, or who are seeking employment in a restricted market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, I reiterate that it should look at a further curtailment of migration except for <span class="highlight">family</span> reunification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  this is the second time in a few months that I have asked the House to express its condolence to  Her  Majesty the Queen following the death of a member of the Royal <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the association of the late Prince’s <span class="highlight">family</span> with Australia has been a close one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A home for old people is certainly no substitute for the love aud care of one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> and every effort should be made by young people to accept a greater responsibility for their aged parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a remarkable and very valuable step forward in the concepts which have been introduced by this Government over recent years and it will have a profound effect upon the environment of the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, the Government’s record is of rising costs and prices; a sluggish economy; excessive taxes; declining <span class="highlight">family</span> purchasing power; serious inflationary trends; declining business confidence and the highest rate of unemployment for a decade, with some 100,000 Australians out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the latest report of the Director-General of Social Services we find that the average number of children in each <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving child endowment is 2.18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the report of the Commonwealth’s Director-General of Social Services says that the number of children per <span class="highlight">family</span> endowed is 2.18. and in only one out of 12 families is money coming from the Commonwealth for the third child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 78 of the same document we find that the average annua) amount paid per <span class="highlight">family</span> in 1949 was $90.79, and in 1971, 22 years later, it was $105.13. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same people who told us 18 months ago that immigration must stop because it costs up to $50,000 per migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> to establish them by building houses, roads, schools, hospitals, etc., and that it was uneconomic to bring them in because they were really a manpower loss, tell us that we must stop immigration because they take all the jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, in its study of the care of sick elderly people, was aware of the social and medical advantages which apply when aged people needing only light nursing care are able to be maintained within their own <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are obviously many cases where patients would lead happier and fuller lives if their <span class="highlight">family</span> financial situation enabled them to remain in their homes and to receive an appropriate level of nursing care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases, nursing and medical care form only part of these needs with the remainder able to be adequately provided by the <span class="highlight">family</span>, relatives or friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact of modern day living that the evolution of the so-called nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> tends to exclude, often through necessity rather than choice, the care of parents or grandparents in the same home as their children or other relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also true that there are many families who feel deeply a sense of <span class="highlight">family</span> totality and who make considerable sacrifices to keep elderly relatives within the home even when they may require constant nursing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If genuine concern had been felt, immediate taxation relief by way of tax deduction for money expended on child minding in day care and <span class="highlight">family</span> care centres would have been provided; These mothers’ efforts to maintain themselves and their families should be rewarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After spending a lifetime building up a worthwhile asset, and just when everything is going along nicely, the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> might die unexpectedly, leaving the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the impossible position of having to dispose of their hard earned assets just to satisfy the Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is neglected, abandoned and unwanted by this Government which gives practical aid to the zero population advocates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those opposed to the <span class="highlight">family</span> concept would certainly find comfort in what the Government has done in ignoring the wants of the <span class="highlight">family</span> - the people who have built and who are maintaining our country; those who are upholding the standards upon which this nation has been built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this year of handouts there is nothing for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, which is the base of the development of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Government has ignored the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, lt has disregarded the people who are playing a most important part in building this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the families - the people who are responsible for maintaining this country - are the ones who are suffering most because of the blindness and hardhearted attitude of this Government which through the years has shown scant respect for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment was first introduced in Australia in 1927 - it came into operation on 22nd July 1927 under the Lang administration in New South Wales - that legislation was bitterly opposed in a most cruel and nasty fashion by the Henleys and the Ness’ and others who sat on the LiberalConservative side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other major step taken was to increase dependants allowances in order to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals will put an extra $565m into the pockets of the taxpayer each year and will particularly help the <span class="highlight">family</span> man earning an average income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increasingly, he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> depend on local government to provide a whole new range of basic services in health, welfare, sport, culture and recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave - It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Commonwealth Department of Social Services with the full support and cooperation of the State departments concerned with social and child welfare has commissioned a <span class="highlight">family</span> research project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The areas to be included in the study will include the incidence, causes and consequence of <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown; the emerging new <span class="highlight">family</span> patterns and structures; and community services available to the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advertisements for staff for the <span class="highlight">family</span> research project will appear within the next 2 weeks in the national Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Research Project - Ministerial Statement, 3 lst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently we have been setting the pace on ways to help fulfil the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had been indicating that there is a case to provide, for instance, a mothers allowance so that mothers who wish to stay at home with their <span class="highlight">family</span> will be able to do so or so that other mothers who work will at least have the opportunity of meeting the cost of providing adequate care for their children while they are at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not inquire into the broad aspect of social welfare in the community into which the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dovetail very neatly although representing only one section of a vast range of high priority needs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if we are concerned about social costs - believe me, I appreciate that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  is not only aware of them but is genuinely concerned - arising in our community because of the destruction of the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, we also should be concerned about the tremendous social and economic cost of the single unattached male in our community and of his particular problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merely to restrict the inquiry to the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is to set up an inquiry that is too narrowly based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’ is the same <span class="highlight">family</span>, although its members’, spell their names a little differently! ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular it is a budget for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these are measures which are directed quite specifically at the average <span class="highlight">family</span> person within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to this, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  has said that tax deductions will not be allowed, except for <span class="highlight">family</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As things currently stand, most people, and particularly those with families on lower income levels, would be advantaged if <span class="highlight">family</span> concessions were liberalised and all other deductions eliminated, and the revenue yield would go up as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to young married couples setting up a home and raising and educating a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These , young men and women, totally preoccupied with working, building a home and establishing a <span class="highlight">family</span>, have not the opportunity to organise themselves into yet another pressure group to petition, demonstrate or lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has offered nothing, despite the claim by the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  in his Budget Speech that in framing the Budget he was concerned with the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today the honourable member for Macquarie  (Mr Luchetti)  devoted a certain portion of his speech to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members can take it from me that the Labor Party as a government will certainly see that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are increased substantially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aggregate of what was allowed for life insurance was the same as all the <span class="highlight">family</span> deductions for taxpayers who had incomes less than $70 a week in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were supposed to have been introduced in the interests of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man on low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He floated this concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They mean that as from tomorrow all taxpayers will pay lower income tax and higher <span class="highlight">family</span> deductions will be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, they are designed to benefit the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and, in particular, the one-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all taxpayers in the community, in my view the one in most trouble is the oneincome taxpayer with a <span class="highlight">family</span> to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know of anyone who can accurately determine the statistical evidence in this respect but I am confident that most of those with high savings bank deposits are young people who are perhaps not yet married and are saving up to buy a home, 2 income families and persons in the middle age group whose <span class="highlight">family</span> is off their hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose if we deal in approximations and take an average across the board figure of 10 per cent, we could say that a 10 per cent rise or fall in taxation at the <span class="highlight">family</span> level is worth about $500m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Melbourne Ports indicated that the <span class="highlight">family</span> man - the man on $90 a week or thereabouts - would be the person who would be paying the tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to labour the point about <span class="highlight">family</span> deductions that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports made in his interview. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he is an honourable man and that he was sincere when he talked about doubling <span class="highlight">family</span> deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, I suppose, we all remember the Treasurer having his fingers burned earlier this year when he flew a kite about taxing families rather than individual units within a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">family</span> area is the most critical area of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I venture to guess that even after these changes are made the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with dependants will still not receive the same benefit from his dependants’ allowances as he did in earlier days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  emphasised in the Budget Speech that in the Government’s view personal income tax was too high as it existed last year, and that the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man in particular was being hit too hard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>, the typical suburban <span class="highlight">family</span>, had been hard hit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It works out at about $200 each, or about $800 for an average <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The production manager and the employees interviewed on the programme all testified to the fact that they were getting more <span class="highlight">family</span> life and more time at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estate comprises the matrimonial home and furnishings - this is the sort of thing which happens every day - the <span class="highlight">family</span> car, life assurance, small amounts of cash and other investments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to migrants, it is necessary to take into consideration that the total figures for migrant settlers do not represent the number of persons entitled to be enrolled in the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan because, in the case of families, enrolment by the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> provides Subsidised Health Benefits entitlements for the whole of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The numbers of single persons and of <span class="highlight">family</span> groups of particular sizes are available for assisted migrants but, in the case of unassisted migrants, the figures used in this answer represent an estimate made by the Department of Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These related to the need for child care facilities at a cost to parents which would not impose hardship; vacation centres for the care of children of working mothers; the provision of a much extended system of occupational training for women whose employment has been interrupted by the raising of a <span class="highlight">family</span>; the provision of incentives to private employers able and willing to employ women on a part time and/ or tandem basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a report in The Review, 27th May-2nd June 1972, (a) that the present manager of the Foundation has abolished the Foundation’s welfare program and cancelled such things as providing amenities for showering and shaving or a free meal for welfare cases who needed help to get back their self-respect and dignity before looking for a job or housing and (b) that the second floor of the building used by the Foundation, once used as emergency accommodation for Aboriginals in need, has been converted into a comfortable apartment for the present manager and his <span class="highlight">family</span> at an alleged cost of $7,900; if so, will he investigate these allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-47-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often the survivor is left in a <span class="highlight">family</span> home which is far too commodious and which, because of its size, creates difficulty with which the aged person cannot cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to various food producing services and when he returned to Australia he found that a good number of aged people, especially, as I stated, where only one person remained in the <span class="highlight">family</span> home, did not go to the trouble of preparing a well balanced meal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fully effective programme should both keep up with the growth rate in <span class="highlight">family</span> formation, which is roughly estimated to be of the order of 1,200 new families a year, and overcome at the same time the very substantial backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I estimate that for the first time the allocation for 1972-73, taken along with what the States are doing with funds from their own resources, should provide enough houses to keep pace with the rate of <span class="highlight">family</span> formation amongst those families wishing to occupy houses provided by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of experience we are moving increasingly towards smaller <span class="highlight">family</span>-type hostels as being more attractive to Aboriginal students and workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The West provides to the Commonwealth immense funds through its exports of raw materials and through its royalties, but little is being rechanneled to assist the unemployed and those in <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses or to establish labour intensive works and industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Minister a question about restricting migration to Western Australia to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migration must be further curtailed to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those soldiers who entered the scheme in the early and middle 1950s have had major financial problems, particularly in relation to the size of properties and the inability to get sufficient productivity to get a sufficient cash income to pay the rent based on the valuation and to support their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of one firstclass South Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> which had some experience in clearing land, even in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> would have taken over vast sections of the brigalow country if it had been given any private encouragement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This arrangement would also apply if  a  property had passed to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a deceased settler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister give urgent consideration to restricting migration to <span class="highlight">family</span> re-unions and special cases until the unemployment situation is overcome? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said in this House before, since we have had in this country a level of unemployment which is higher than the Government would desire, instructions have been issued to posts overseas that overseas workers, as opposed to <span class="highlight">family</span> re-union cases, are to be brought to Australia only in categories for which, on the advice of the Department of Labour and National Service, there is still a demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely this woman, who already has a <span class="highlight">family</span>, who is a mother, a housewife and a deserted wife to boot, should not be penalised in such a way on the basis that the child was not of the legal marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those sorts of people to be on the unemployment benefit is not only unreasonable, discriminating and repressive for them but is terribly unfair for their children who have never done anything wrong in society except perhaps to be born into a lower socio-economic <span class="highlight">family</span> and accordingly attract the sort of penalty from the conservative Government of which I speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rates of benefit are $17 a week for an adult or married minor, $8 for a spouse, $4.50 for each child under 16 years, and so they go on through the range of social service benefits affecting the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be remembered that in June 1966 Professor Henderson set down a poverty line of $33 which he applied to what he called the standard <span class="highlight">family</span>, which was a man, wife and 2 children paying rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the soldiers’ children’s education scheme is one of the most effective and continuous forms of social service operating in this country, but the fact is that the deprivation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> because of the loss of a serviceman, or the total or partial incapacity of a serviceman, is totally immeasurable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The irony of the situation is that had they, as a young couple, migrated to Australia without a child and subsequently had a slow learning child, no thought would now be given to deporting the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put such a barrier to reuniting a <span class="highlight">family</span> is incredibly harsh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  to reconsider the situation and to see what can be done to admit the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, in many cases a farm cannot be sold because it provides a living to a <span class="highlight">family</span> - a comfortable enough living perhaps but not a living that is consonant with the capital value of the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a primary production estate, even though it is carrying a burden of debt, can be reasonably viable one day and virtually insolvent the next day as a result of the imposition of death duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we increase benefits I hope that they will continue to be channelled into the hands of the immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> of the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has caused great personal hardship particularly throughout the countryside, led to the destruction of <span class="highlight">family</span> farms and even to the break-up of families themselves in tragic circumstances, trying to meet an impossible tax conceived 2 generations ago and allowed to grow into a mindless, inflexible Frankenstein monster which has devoured and destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the legislation leaves the tax with all its inequality and the fact that it applies only to the little man - to the <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise whether it is a farm or a business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise in most cases has not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once he was required to sell the property to meet probate he faced bankruptcy and the destruction  of the <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from a now inadequate share of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home, she realises she is just a chattel who must prove ownership of every single item or pay duty, plus the heavy legal expenses involved, on everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Paying out of capital, her future livelihood is reduced; indeed, in some cases, a widow finds she is forced upon the charity of her <span class="highlight">family</span> or even becomes an added burden on the State, And this at the most traumatic moment of her life; when she may be quite old and forced to face a contingency she and her husband made heavy sacrifices to avoid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The countryside and the nation generally will certainly, in contrast, warmly welcome the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition at Cowra in New South Wales where he proclaimed the Opposition policy that the assets of a <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise, whether a farming enterprise or a business enterprise in the town, should not be diminished by the death of one of the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This commitment and this policy will certainly answer the plea of the widows and <span class="highlight">family</span> numbers who have to face the hardships created by a tax which is shot full of anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we accept what is before us in this measure but we serve notice that the alternative government of this country is pledged to end a system that attacks the very survival of <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He suggested that the rate of new <span class="highlight">family</span> formation was about 1,100 or 1,200 Aboriginal families a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact very shortly I will be going out into one of these areas by aeroplane and surface vehicle to try to appraise whether it will be suitable for an old Aborigine who considers he can live on it with his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of Aborigines in this area have the determination and ability to run some places on their own, but the point is that the Aboriginal philosophy is such that if one man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> get onto a block and get a few head of cattle and some water they are obliged to see that their relatives, if they arrive on the verandah or outside the homestead, are watered, fed and cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The children who go to the greater public schools come from the more affluent sections of the community - from the professional sections of the community and from favourable <span class="highlight">family</span> backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We run on the formulation of the Australian Council for Educational Research an examination which picks up those children who are most advantaged in the cognitive use of languages, which means, of course, the children from the sort of <span class="highlight">family</span> background of the professional groups in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person can turn up to a non-state school with his <span class="highlight">family</span> and knock on the door and say: ‘I have just come from Turkey, Greece or Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the children who attend state secondary high schools and technical schools, one in every 15 is from a <span class="highlight">family</span> which earns less than the minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not make a scrap of difference to the child in the country school, the child from the working class <span class="highlight">family</span>, the child from the migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> and all those whom we regard as being in the low income section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not make a scrap of difference because the means test is applied through this scheme itself which has been convincingly proved over and over again to be discriminatory against a child who happens to be born into a lower income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as this policy of ignoring need continues there will be children whose abilities cannot be utilised to the maximum simply because they are victims of the <span class="highlight">family</span> income situations into which they happen to be born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have endeavoured to escape from the Scylla of cramming - it is not an examination in the ordinary sense - but they have not escaped the Charybdis of the sociological and <span class="highlight">family</span> condition of a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A child with verbal manipulative skills, with a <span class="highlight">family</span> background of developed conversation, approaches an examination which diagnoses those verbal skills with a great advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, under the present scheme a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $51.50, which is equivalent to $2,678 per annum, but n&gt;i exceeding $54.50- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the South Australian medical benefits organisations have recommended that they do not pay amounts of fund benefit because the charges are raised by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association and not by medical practitioners in private practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then there was some weeping concerning the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What does the Labor Party say about the relationship of the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor with the Trojan horse of its own salaried service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What doctors have not come to terms with yet is that the concept of the ‘folksy’ old <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor is largely dead and gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let there be no doubt in anybody’s mind that the philosophy and the intention of the Opposition concerning the general practitioner in Australia - that old folksy <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor - is perfectly clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no question whatsoever that the Government believes that the general practitioner - the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, if you like - is absolutely fundamental to the proper operation of any medical system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One problem is that often in these <span class="highlight">family</span> units there exists a disabled member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 should point out that successful achievement in this respect was built on the basis of chain migration and <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to do the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  an injustice, but 1 think he tended to imply that a system of migration that was based on chain migration and <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions would result in us being inclined to get labour that was somewhat less desirable than would be obtained in a mass recruited migrant system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The criteria that has applied to chain migration and <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions in the area I happen to represent have been tougher in practically every respect than the criteria that have been applied to mass recruitment migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important to acknowledge that this initiative comprehends assistance at 3 levels - that of the child, of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this reason the level of fees charged a <span class="highlight">family</span> at each point in time must be left to the judgment of supervisors of centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Persons in charge of centres will be required to seek the co-operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling and other local social welfare agencies including those operated by local governing authorities, especially in cases of <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption and where parents or guardians are seeking to place very young children in centres; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One practical application of this proposition will be studies to review how the scheme provided for in this legislation is meeting the needs of the child, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community, and to identify inadequacies, if any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One area that will inevitably attract investigation is alternative forms of child day care such as <span class="highlight">family</span> day care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Child care centres have to be seen in their proper perspective; they are supportive of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and in extreme cases are the alternative to placing children in residential institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They prepared a budget for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 5, comprising a husband, wife and 3 children on the minimum wage paid in Queensland - the lowest wage would be $46.80 - and this budget showed that at the end of the week, if they did not run into expenses, the <span class="highlight">family</span> could have 50c left for luxuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, why did it have to go cap in hand begging the McLachlan <span class="highlight">family</span> in South Australia, who went under the neck of the Commonwealth Government after it had written a cheque for the amount involved in the acquisition of this property, and plead with the <span class="highlight">family</span> to allow the Commonwealth to purchase it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will terminate on that point, but perhaps I should add that Murumba Minerals was also controlled by the Barton <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of an old pastoral <span class="highlight">family</span>, I know that the old pastoral companies from the United Kingdom have been in Australia from the very beginning of white settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that type of community which existed and which still exists in some parts of Australia, the work of the head of the house was generally seen to be crucial to the survival of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the father did mattered to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community hung together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, taking the example of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 5 members with the married man getting $17 a week, the dependent spouse $8 a week, and 3 children under 16 getting $13.50 a week, the total income of that <span class="highlight">family</span> in this day and age would be $38.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That weekly income has to keep that <span class="highlight">family</span> in food and clothing and provide all of those other things which each one of us who has a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> to keep has to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that if a child of one of these unfortunate families in these circumstances turns 16, and if the child has ability and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community generally want that child to stay at school and perhaps go forward to university, the allowance payable for that child ceases immedi ately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New Zealand the recipients of <span class="highlight">family</span> benefits, as they are called there, who wish to capitalise child endowment have to pay a penalty for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 6 children whose ages ranged from below 12 months to 5 years would pay a penalty of about $438. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that the <span class="highlight">family</span> of whom I have just spoken, with children whose ages ranged from under 12 months to 5 years, would’ forfeit over $2,000 for the term of these children’s entitlement to child endowment by capitalising at this early stage of which 1 have already spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if a mother and children leave the father in occupancy of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home - the reason does not matter - and the house has been purchased with a deposit funded by capitalised child endowment the mother and children will forfeit their equity in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the entitlement is based on <span class="highlight">family</span> size rather than on demonstrated needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent New Zealand royal commission into social security at paragraph 21/92 stated:   we note -the view expressed to us by the representative of the State Advances Corporation that while the amount of capitalised <span class="highlight">family</span> benefit has been invaluable as a deposit, it has had a very limited effect in reducing outgoings on a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have on numerous occasions known of the breadwinner passing on and leaving a wife and children behind and then the friends and neighbours taking up a collection or holding a raffle to assist in paying the funeral expenses and also to provide some cash to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> carry on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mean reasonably’ in the sense that it is accepted as a responsibility of the community to see that this provision is not abused and to see that certificates are not handed out to unjustifiable cases merely because the patient or the patient’s <span class="highlight">family</span> happens to be a good friend of the doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, for the community as a whole there will be an extension and upgrading of an invaluable community service supportive of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is repeated in many other advanced countries and I believe that the proportion of working mothers will continue to rise as women see their role in life as embracing more than just being married and raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action of the Government in making the repeal of these discriminatory provisions one of its first legislative acts is a token of our determination to banish racial discrimination within our community and is also a step towards building on equal terms the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation in citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should add that the actual benefit set out in the Bill for the unemployed and sick will provide a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 4 with $46.50 a week which is a very considerable increase over the levels of $34 and $37 that previously applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, a government which is concerned to eliminate poverty must do more than provide adequate social services, lt must also endeavour to ensure that the lowest wage is such that no man can work for a full week and then take home an income that would leave an average <span class="highlight">family</span> living in poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1966 the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission introduced the minimum wage concept for adult males and although it was initially above the poverty line as set by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic Research it later fell below that level for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 4 and is still below that level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The butter industry on the Downs is in serious difficulty - due to harsh seasons, Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community and the increases in the margarine quota, and a price received completely unrelated to the cost of production as it does not take into account the value of unpaid <span class="highlight">family</span> labour - and, I emphasise, the Australian ethos has been built on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under these amendments, a widow will not have to prove dependency if she was living with the employee on a bona fide domestic basis at the date of his death and, for this purpose, she will qualify if she was only temporarily living apart from him, perhaps because he was in hospital or she was merely temporarily away from the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the previous Government, workers who suffered injuries at work faced not only the impossibility of living on workers compensation payments but also the cruelty of not knowing for sure that they would get any benefit; workers were never sure when they would be facing up to the counter of a Commonwealth Employment Office week after week, having to wait 7 days to accept unemployment benefits which were only a fraction of the real cost of living; workers faced periods of sickness knowing that Commonwealth social security sickness benefits would barely keep a <span class="highlight">family</span> from starvation; workers could never be sure they would not receive an injury at home which left them unemployable, and facing a lifetime on an inadequate invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be a matter for each university to determine who should receive, assistance but I would expect that grants would be made available to students who are in extremely difficult financial circumstances following misfortune outside their control, such as death, injury, serious illness or desertion by breadwinners of families on ordinary incomes; the annihilation of <span class="highlight">family</span> income in flood, drought or bushfire; seasonal or chronic unemployment of the breadwinner; loss of earning power by the breadwinner for any other reason; unreasonable refusal of financial support by parents; and to the children of age, invalid or widow pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ninety per cent of Australia’s married women of child-bearing age practise <span class="highlight">family</span> planning but only 63 per cent of those who do so use reliable methods such as oral contraceptives and intra-uterine devices, or exercise an informed preference for the ovulation method associated with the Catholic faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One per cent of the married women who practise <span class="highlight">family</span> planning rely upon douching, which has a failure rate of 31 per cent; 2 per cent upon spermicides, with a failure rate of 20 per cent; 5 per cent upon diaphragms, with a failure rate of 12 per cent; 9 per cent upon condoms, with a failure rate of 14 per cent; and 19 per cent upon withdrawal, with a failure rate of 18 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas only 7 per cent of married women with 13 or more years of formal education have never practised <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, 11 per cent of those with 10 to 12 years of education, 13 per cent of those with 7 to 9 years of education, 19 per cent of those with 1 to 6 years of education and 22 per cent of those who are devoid of formal education - they are a significant group within our community - have never done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ignorance of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and failures of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, often arising from the economic circumstance with which this Bill in part deals, have created a situation in which doctors estimate that up to half the pregnancies which occur in Australia each year are unwanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost benefit studies which were carried out in 1972 by Political and Economic Planning for the British <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association established that averting the birth of an unwanted child saved in public health and welfare services alone $1,350 in the case of a child born fourth in its <span class="highlight">family</span>, $1,510 in the case of a child born fifth in its <span class="highlight">family</span> and $8,728 in the case of the illegitimate child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a mark of our backwardness in matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning that comparable studies on the cost of unwanted children to Australia do not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our former Government increased enormously the likelihood of unwanted pregnancies, abortions and unloved children by refusing to promote sex education in schools or to assist the States, local government bodies and voluntary agencies such as churches in the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics through which information on birth control techniques, Including for those who prefer it the ovulation method, could be disseminated effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It hampered <span class="highlight">family</span> planning by prohibiting the advertising of contraceptives, imposing tariff duties and a ‘luxury’ sales tax of 271 per cent on contraceptives and by excluding prescribed oral contraceptives from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whereas the former Government subsidised <span class="highlight">family</span> planning for Aborigines but not for other Australians, the present Government has already made available $300,000 for the development of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning in all sections of our community, including those whose interest is restricted to the ovulation method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will try to be more relevant than speakers from the other side of the House who in my opinion used their contributions to this debate to rationalise their inactivity in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning or at least in the role that the Federal Government should play in the field of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless this matter is seen in the whole context it is seen in isolation and a role cannot be forged for the Federal Government in <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To retain the sales tax on contraceptives is an unjustified discrimination and penalty against Australian women wishing to practice responsible methods of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The contraceptive can both stabilise marriage, if the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, by removing fear of unwanted pregnancies or it could encourage infidelity for the same reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must realise that removing sales tax from contraceptives is only portion of the whole question of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning; it is the part that can be played by this Government in providing such a service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removing that sales tax, luxury tax or entertainment tax, as I have sometimes heard it called, from contraceptives is only one approach that the Labor Party, this Government, is committed to introducing in its overall program to support <span class="highlight">family</span> planning as the right for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are committed to setting up <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics which could provide facilities in the 3 areas in which we need to improve our <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services, namely, advice, education and free supplies of contraceptives for those who need them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To add to the nonsense and counter-productive effect of prohibiting advertising of contraceptives, most States are prevented by law from even advertising the activities and services of government supported <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in the Territories that the Commonwealth oan sponsor a whole range of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning initiatives, but Australia-wide we can make a significant contribution to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning by removing the sales tax on contraceptives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pose this question to the Treasurer: Would not the cost involved in placing the pill on the pharmaceutical benefits list have better served the community, particularly that section of the community which is being discussed in this House today, if the money had been spent on more <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics and child care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter is a complex one which I do not wish to go into in detail at this time, but 1 believe that the measure to remove the sales tax on contraceptives, as proposed in the Bill, is only one of a wide variety of <span class="highlight">family</span> support, counselling, education and other social welfare programs which this Parliament should consider and support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, on the one hand, the Australian Labor Party wishes to control the natural increase of Australian born children while on the other hand allowing the uncontrolled immigration of people into Australia, irrespective of their country of origin and including nonEuropeans, merely on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth provides substantial subsidies for the expansion of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to these amounts of money, the new Government is allocating over $250,000 to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am opposed to the pill being on the free list and I would prefer to see these funds of $5m, or S8m from next year, allocated to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning agencies rather than the present system of subsidising the use of the pill and other devices - and they are being subsidised - because <span class="highlight">family</span> planning agencies provide counselling and advice across the whole range of <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was pointed out to me in conversations with senior members of the staff at this mental hospital that there are 2 or 3 sisters and 2 or 3 brothers who are inmates of the institution who probably would not have been there had their parents received <span class="highlight">family</span> planning advice or been able to obtain contraceptives at a reasonable price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that whilst this measure will be of great benefit at this time in our history I certainly would not like to see a decline in the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in Australia because I believe that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, with devoted parents showing proper and true affection to the number of children that they want, is the richest asset any country can possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the things that has happened m the structural changes in the proprietary companies is that there has been a great deal of finance invested in companies which previously were to a considerable degree locked in because families were involved over a successive number of generations and as a result of the death of one or another of the early members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> it was not possible to apply large amounts of capital to develop or to change the basic operation of the former <span class="highlight">family</span> based company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The privilege of owning his home is a large part of a man’s heritage, and I completely agree with the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson)  that more avenues should be made available for a man to obtain finance to rear his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Psychologically it is a great benefit for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to have their own home because they are inclined to be much more community conscious, which leads, as we know, to a great deal of desirable parochial pride. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The system now seeks people who can go out and find out what needs to be done, and then not merely make a speech about it, send a telegram to a member of Parliament or call a public meeting, but put in writng the aims, aspirations and needs of a particular community or a particular <span class="highlight">family</span> and convey them to the Minister or to the Department in order that the problems might be looked at and, if possible, solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree that there must be an association in the mind of a young child with the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation and the transition which all children have to undertake from a purely <span class="highlight">family</span> situation to one of the wider community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The best estimate that I have been able to obtain of the consequences of the 35-hour week would be that it would add $800 a year to the costs of an average <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the poor who must struggle to keep up and fight the never ending battle of stretching shrinking dollars to cover <span class="highlight">family</span> needs* Perhaps, as one political analyst put it, it is true to say that the poor, by and large, are locked into safe Labor electorates or otherwise - I am thinking particularly of pensioners - they are to be found in the so-called widow belts of seats held by honourable members on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is thinking of nationalisation, and he could well be doing that, he should look at the lesson which history has taught us and particularly at what we once regarded as the European <span class="highlight">family</span>, the <span class="highlight">family</span> from which we have been emotionally expelled and will very soon be effectively expelled because we are becoming more and more regarded as a member of the communist bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> goes to the unemployment office and says, in effect, that the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> do not want to work and that they are unemployable - it is easy to find a way of proving such a claim - they can draw $102 a week in unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the House: What will the conscientious, hardworking person, whether he be Australian born or a migrant, on $65 a week, with a wife and 3 or 4 children say about working for that wage when he can go to the unemployment office with his <span class="highlight">family</span> and draw in excess of $102 a week without doing a tap of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, 1.5 million adult males in Australia were earning less than what it is possible for such a person and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to draw in unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would, strongly support any move to make generous unemployment benefits available to, for example, someone who is redundant, someone whose firm has been taken over and which does not have a vacancy for him or a sick wage earner such as the head of a <span class="highlight">family</span> who has children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be a matter for each college of advanced education to determine who shall receive assistance, but I would expect that the grants would be made available to students who are in extremely difficult financial circumstances following misfortune outside their control, such as death, injury, serious illness or desertion by bread-winners of families on ordinary incomes; the annihilation of <span class="highlight">family</span> income in flood, drought or bushfire; seasonal or chronic unemployment of the bread-winner; loss of earning power by the bread-winner or any other reason; unreasonable refusal of financial support by parents; and to the children of age, invalid or widow pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All work by its very nature is hazardous because it takes a man away from the things he would wish to do or the things he would probably normally do, and in order to satisfy the economic needs of his <span class="highlight">family</span> he engages in activities that are not necessarily familiar to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope very shortly to introduce into this House a Bill aimed at this problem of helping the young married couples particularly in respect of housing difficulties which they must face on the birth of the first child which prevents the continuance of the earning of 2 incomes in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that it will be a matter for each university to determine who shall receive assistance, but I would expect that grants would be made available to students who are in extremely difficult financial circumstances following misfortune outside thencontrol such as death, injury, serious illness or desertion by breadwinners of families on ordinary income; the annihilation of <span class="highlight">family</span> income in flood, drough or bushfire; seasonal or chronic unemployment of the breadwinner; loss of earning power by the breadwinner for any other reason and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be said that they should take this into account as one of the risks of coming  to  live in Australia either because they personally wish to come here or because they are drawn here to join relatives and <span class="highlight">family</span> living permanently in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he had any discussion with the Minister about amending the way in which migrants are selected to come to Australia, that is, has he discussed whether the Government will recommence recruiting migrants to Australia according to their skills for work in the work force and not rely solely upon <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions to answer the need of Australia’s development and the shortage of workers in, for instance, the important building industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments which deny their responsibility by failing to provide efficient <span class="highlight">family</span> planning programs and then prohibit abortion on request can only be described as architects of double standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to confine one’s thinking to this single absolutist principle is to ignore the many other rights inherent in the situation, such as the rights to health and welfare of the mother and her existing <span class="highlight">family</span>, the rights to choose whether to bear children or not and the right of the child to be wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced personally or through <span class="highlight">family</span> associations with a situation in which a decision must be made, I think most of Ug could find ways of justifying in our own minds that an abortion should be performed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me  that  there is a real question to be dealt with here - whether the right to life of the unborn child can be subordinated to the quality of life of the existing <span class="highlight">family</span> or the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To me, these trends must result in a weakening of those institutions - marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> - which provide the best environment for the upbringing of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should we not be moving more quickly to the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether this Bill is passed or not, might it not be worth while to consider the establishment, perhaps in the Australian Capital Territory for a start, of special clinics to deal not only with <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, .education and similar matters but also with abortion legally performed under the existing law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(5)In what ways can the incidence of abortion be reduced by improving services and facilities such as sex education in schools, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics, supply of contraceptives, pregnancy support agencies, adoption agencies and social security payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That situation has been created not by permissive abortion laws or by abortion law reformers, but by the apathy which keeps us from facing up squarely to the challenge of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning or taking seriously the breakdown in fertility control and other social policies to which I have already referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variations between countries in the incidence of abortion - and they have been clearly documented - demonstrate conclusively that the ratio of abortions to live births depends not upon the flexibility or rigidity of the laws by which abortion is governed, but upon the initiative which governments show in providing proper sex education and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services and the support that is given by public opinion to governments in the provision of these services and their use by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Britain where abortion laws are relatively permissive and in Sweden where abortion laws are relatively strict, widespread use of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning keeps the rate at which women are aborted to between 12 and 15 abortions for every 100 live births. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, where abortion is permitted and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning is neglected, have between 30 and 35 abortions for every 100 live births. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France, which endeavoured until recently to suppress both abortion and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, has 50 abortions for every 100 live births, and Italy where both abortions and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning are still suppressed has abortions and live births in equal numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not begin to reduce the frequency with which women are aborted until we establish clearly in the public mind that there is a connection between abortion and the inadequacy of arrangements under which sex education is provided in our schools; between abortion and our shortage of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics, pregnancy support agencies and adoption agencies; and between abortion and our tradition of treating as outcasts from society the unmarried mother and her child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a thoroughly healthy woman with a small <span class="highlight">family</span> and more or less unlimited financial resources would not dream of seeking an abortion simply because she would prefer to have, say, a Mercedes car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, will he accept my assurance - I am sure that I speak for all honourable members who, out of a strong conviction on the basic principles involved, voted against the Bill and the amendment - that the House will co-operate to the fullest possible extent in helping the Government expedite the development of measures such as <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics, child care centres and education programs which will make an important and constructive contribution to the solving of the serious personal problems which abortion raises for many people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this were translated into increased savings for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man, intent upon providing the security of a home for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, it would mean that he would have to increase his earnings by $48 a week which, when one considers the average wage of about $95 to $98, would make it an impossible task to clothe, feed and house his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the increase in housing costs is added to that, the amount translated into increased savings is almost an incredible $80 a week to enable the <span class="highlight">family</span> man to purchase land and establish a home in these outer eastern suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Royal Commission would point out ins social and personal needs for women in the community - marriage counselling, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and sex education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main bread-winner - exclusive of any overtime and child endowment payments - does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the <span class="highlight">family</span> includes more than 2 children, this will be increased by $2 per week for each child beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement also provides that each State will ensure that the number of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings allocated by its housing authority to families who satisfy the needs test shall not be less than the total number of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built with our advances and become available during the year for allocation for the first time, and 25 per cent of the number of <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings constructed by the States with financial assistance under this and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the proposed Agreement up to 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built by housing authorities with our advances may be sold at a fair price to families who satisfy the needs test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said before, a matter which at some time or other impacts itself upon every <span class="highlight">family</span> in this nation was allowed  3i hoars  of debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will sponsor a move, if someone does not pre-empt me as I believe someone may to put a motion before this House for some inquiry to be made into these agonising questions on a matter which impacts itself on every <span class="highlight">family</span> throughout this nation at one time or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This will have an effect upon that country and upon the economies she influences similar to that which it would have in any <span class="highlight">family</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>College students generally come from poorer <span class="highlight">family</span> backgrounds than do university students, and are less able to afford to buy the books required for their course reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Australian Government taken any action to protest against (a) the judicial murder of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 5 Iraqi Jews in Baghdad and the previous public hanging of Jews in that city; (b) the detention and murder of Pakistani prisoners-of-war in Indian POW camps; and (c) the judicial murder of Asian and Ugandan citizens in Uganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what ways can the incidence of abortion be reduced by improving services and facilities such as sex education in schools, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning clinics, supply of contraceptives, pregnancy support agencies, adoption agencies and social security payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only end by saying that this is not because we think parents should never discourage their children’s marriages but because this is not the way to do it; not because we think well of marriages made in defiance of parents but because we think the law now contributes to the defiance, not because the <span class="highlight">family</span> is too weak to use this weapon but because it is strong enough to do without it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should perhaps say, because I believe there are some in the community who will regard this Bill perhaps as loosening some <span class="highlight">family</span> or parental influences which they consider should be maintained, that the Latey Commission gave very careful consideration to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all firmly believe in the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the last thing we would want to do is to pull the rug from under it; but after much thought we have come to the conclusion that this argument does not stand up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that in this field at least the law is useless as a strengthener of <span class="highlight">family</span> ties, and indeed by the friction it causes between the generations may well help to wear them through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have seen the <span class="highlight">family</span> strain which occurs when there is parental opposition and children have to go before a magistrate to get consent to marry in defiance of their parent’s wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I wish to make it clear that although the Opposition is not opposed to this Bill its main concern is with the normal 2-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> and especially the young <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, while supporting this legislation, puts as its first priority the needs of the young <span class="highlight">family</span> who face many difficulties and who have accepted their heavy responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like other honourable members, I have had widowed constituents coming along to me with their problems and showing quite clearly the difficulties they encounter in caring for a large <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the legislation of the Commonwealth, through broadening for social security purposes the definition of the term ‘widow’, provides for families other than those where the <span class="highlight">family</span> is fatherless as a consequence of the death of the father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They try to anticipate the burdens that will be placed upon them when they undertake the rearing of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I support this legislation for what it will do for the children of fatherless families, I do urge the Government to look into the establishment of a far more comprehensive <span class="highlight">family</span> benefits scheme whereby young mothers with very young children can, in effect, be paid to be at home providing the care that they wish to give to their children so that, instead of the community having to pay for substitute mothers, the natural mother of the child can provide care at home, certainly during the infant and pre-school days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will find that by tackling in a piecemeal fashion the problems concerning the provision of benefits for children we will impose great pressures on the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> in the community and that by putting those pressures on that <span class="highlight">family</span> we will cause greater difficulties in the future because of the inability of the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> to face the financial burdens that are imposed upon it when the first and second children come along and the mother chooses to stay at home and care for those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This discrimination between the different <span class="highlight">family</span> groupings within the community is likely to cause severe difficulty for the future generations of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we need to look at them in a more sensible fashion and to adjust the benefits at levels according to the needs of the families to enable them to spread their earning capacity in a way which permits them to provide their children with a reasonable standard of living at all stages of the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  and the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  have both, T think very rightly, drawn attention to the need to look after the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> to a greater extent and particularly to the need to look after the married couple at the birth of their first and second children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should also recall that the previous Government commissioned a <span class="highlight">family</span> research project through the Commonwealth Department of Social Services with the full support and co-operation of the State departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was realised that the <span class="highlight">family</span> research project would have great significance in developing in Australia a social services system which was fully balanced, efficient and humane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the redistribution can contribute to social and welfare progress in municipal areas in terms of halls, libraries, swimming pools, community welfare centres, the community nurse nursing service, the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning centre and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of the difficulties that can be faced by widowers of relatively small means who are left to care for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had a complaint from a migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> which I believe should be conveyed to the House in order to draw attention to a highly undesirable practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only today I received a complaint of an unsolicited visit to a private home by a canvasser who, in the absence of the parents, questioned a 14- year old daughter of the <span class="highlight">family</span> on her parents’ work and income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not be surprised if when that report is issued it is found that among the people who are suffering most there are many of these young couples whom we would consider to be almost in a normal situation but who have <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities which they find difficult to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its efforts to help such groups, the Labor Government’s social welfare program, as revealed to us so far, is getting to a stage where it is placing impossible burdens on the traditional base of society, the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that women work from the time they complete their formal education until the commencement of the <span class="highlight">family</span> formation period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can so easily create the impression that the position today for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> is entirely satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is increasing evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of poverty arises from our failure to effectively relate <span class="highlight">family</span> income to <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a time the wage differential between rates of pay for men and women doing the same job was justified on the ground that the wage system was thus made sensitive to <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the wage system is insensitive to <span class="highlight">family</span> size, how then do we equalise the burden of child rearing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly there is an overwhelming case against tackling the problem by efforts to make the wage  system  sensitive to <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task is to resolve how best to enable men and women to spread their income over their lives so as to give them the means of keeping the <span class="highlight">family</span> when they need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important also that we take steps to ensure that the standard of a living of a 2 parent <span class="highlight">family</span> where, the mother, iu the interests of her children, stays at home to care for them, compares favourably with such a <span class="highlight">family</span> where the mother, due to the age of her children, feels that she can go out to work without prejudice to their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet to take that job would enable her to ease the economic pressure on the <span class="highlight">family</span> to meet the commitments on the first and second mortgage on the house and other loans in respect of a refrigerator, a television set and a secondhand car that she and her husband had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She also justified her decision to take full time employment on the ground that when the child was going to school the child would have greater opportunities available to it because of the economic resources then available to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The incomes coming into the <span class="highlight">family</span> were the incomes that both of them brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst her friend staying at home was constantly under pressure in meeting the <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments, she saw her friend relieved of those pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As more and more young mothers feel that the economic pressures upon them are such that against their better judgment they must go out to work even when their young children need them at home, more and more young mothers will do so because the contrasts between the 2 alternatives of being a 2 income <span class="highlight">family</span> and a single income one will be so marked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to ask ourselves whether extended <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances by way of substantially increased benefits should be made available at certain periods in a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need also to look at important measures such as that introduced this morning by the honourable member for Mackellar, for this Bill is a measure to provide some alleviation of the financial burden that is imposed upon the young normal <span class="highlight">family</span> and to relieve the young mother of some of the financial pressures that would otherwise be on that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will give them a real incentive to provide for the future, lt will enable them to level out the peaks of affluence against the troughs of poverty which are experienced during the life span of any individual because the demands upon the resources of our earnings vary according to our <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure will go some distance in recognising the need to help in a big way a normal, young 2-parent single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A young <span class="highlight">family</span> can, say, cash sufficient to provide for a deposit on a house and, get long term finance for the balance of the purchase price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then a young <span class="highlight">family</span> can work out for itself a planned program whereby it can cash a sufficient number each year in order to meet the mortgage payments on the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the community as a whole accepts that it is in the best interests of the community, the children and the families who make up the community that the mother should be at home to care for her young <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore urge this House to enable this Bill to be studied in detail, in the total context of the need for us to make it easier for the normal young <span class="highlight">family</span> to bring up Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why not extend these conditions to enable a current borrower to obtain finance for additional accommodation for a growing <span class="highlight">family</span> or aged parents or in some other similar circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> homes to be built by the State Housing Authorities with our advances will be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinners will not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the agreement and, where the <span class="highlight">family</span> includes 2 or more children, this will be increased by $2 a week for each child beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Housing has estimated that each of the 93,000 applications on the waiting lists of the nation’s housing authorities represent  a  <span class="highlight">family</span> of 4 or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the proposed Agreement up to 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built by the housing authorities with our advances may be sold at a fair price to families who satisfy the needs test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the States have a death benefit insurance scheme for persons purchasing their homes so that in the event of the decease of a breadwinner the purchase price outstanding is discharged and the <span class="highlight">family</span> has no fear of losing the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were to engage in the practice of employing guest workers as it operates in, for example, some European countries we would be abandoning our traditional attitude to migration; that is thai we bring people to this country, welcome them and want them eventually to join the nation, to join the national <span class="highlight">family</span> and be a part of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I speak of emergency housing I mean true emergency housing that could be made available at an instant’s notice when a crisis arose, whether it be flood, bush fire, some domestic dispute or something else that might cause a <span class="highlight">family</span> to be immediately evicted and left without proper shelter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Buying a house is compulsory saving, and if there is one thing in this community that a <span class="highlight">family</span> should have it is security in some form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Should the death of the breadwinner unfortunately happen, a death benefit insurance scheme provides security for the <span class="highlight">family</span> of an eligible participant by providing payments for all outstanding loan money and this, of course, is a marvellous thing, because even a week after a tenant has decided to buy his home and the necessary documents have been finalised, should the breadwinner die then the wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> become the owner of the home entirely unencumbered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should the present Government push such a philosophy on a Liberal government which has seen a policy bloom into such remarkable success in Victoria where 33,832 home owners, all needy people, are at last assured of some security as far as their wives and <span class="highlight">family</span> are concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Home ownership surely is the goal of every Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> and we as legislators must be aware of the problems that are being experienced in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that the legislation provides that no fewer than 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> homes to be built by State housing authorities with Commonwealth funds will be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner does not exceed 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings per employed male unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kelson, Billings, Stevens and the Dyason <span class="highlight">family</span> (including two <span class="highlight">family</span> investment companies, Dyason Investments Pty Ltd and Kunyung Investments Pty Ltd) are shareholders in Increment Fund Incorporated, with total holdings direct and indirect of at least 262,000 shares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, during the period when a woman has a young <span class="highlight">family</span> it may be possible for employment to be provided on the basis of a 2 or 3-day working week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not regard the question of maternity leave solely as an industrial benefit, because to consider the proposition in that way is to introduce an element of positive discrimination in favour of working women who raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It in fact left the <span class="highlight">family</span> man to find his own feet and do the best he could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact in this day and age, m spite of all the modern technology, we find that the average <span class="highlight">family</span> needs to spend more time at work to provide for the needs of that <span class="highlight">family</span> than did our grandfathers and great grandparents a hundred years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was necessary in those days for the breadwinner to work 60 hours a week to provide for the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we find that the male in the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is working a standard week of 40 hours and an average amount of overtime of 4.3 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it can be seen that on the average the working week of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been extended in order to provide for the basic needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that even a cursory glance at the available statistics will establish beyond any shadow of a doubt that the overwhelming majority of female employees who are married are continuing in employment to do no more than to supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income and so to provide the basic needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it ill behoves the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  or any other honourable member opposite, after the long period that they had in government and during which they refused to do anything to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, now to criticise this Government which is in its early stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This illustrates that in this type of legislation we have not only concern for those who are part of a married <span class="highlight">family</span> unit but also a growing concern for unmarried mothers in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the average marrying age has decreased from 25.5 years in 1948 to 21.4 in 1971, it can be seen from an examination of available statistics that the great majority of married women return to employment to supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the undeniable fact is that one income is no longer sufficient to satisfy the needs of most <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Denison  (Dr Gaha)  suggested that, instead of augmenting the <span class="highlight">family</span> income by the payment of child endowment, we should provide for the sale of houses at lower prices and that it should be possible to use the money now paid in child endowment to amortise the cost of such an undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: In addition to his comprehensive program for social welfare will he give urgent consideration to the problems of families, and the need to provide increased <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance so that mothers will not be compelled by economic circumstances to seek employment which would disadvantage her children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then if the scrip was successful one found that members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and companies associated with the founders of the company were able to take up options once they had proved that the scrip had a certain market value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because, for example, the particular sections dealing with the ‘more than 50 per cent’ test will be mandatory - unless of course the continuing business test is satisfied - and are not alleviated by any saving provision, such as there is in relation to the tests of public company status, which would authorise the loss to be allowed, notwithstanding failure to satisfy the continuity test, if, say, the excessive changes in ownership are explicable by ordinary business or <span class="highlight">family</span> dealing and had no substantial fiscal motive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another anomaly could arise if we assume that there was a more than 50 per cent change, over the  7  year period in which a loss can be carried forward, in the beneficial ownership of a company’s shares due to <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances such as sons and sons-in-law coming into the business, trusts for infant children being created and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This example is a case where one <span class="highlight">family</span> bought the shares of their relatives who held just over 50 per cent of the shareholding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, if one wished to prolong the debate on this issue, one could say that, although <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprises in Australia represent the most efficient sector of farming, in effect the operation of the Bill that the Treasurer has before the House today could hand this sector over to corporate farming and limit the value of this efficient sector of farming, that is, if we ignore the lower level which hardly pays taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Changes could be exempted, it has been suggested to me, by ‘the explicable by ordinary business or <span class="highlight">family</span> dealing clauses’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) Approval was granted for the entry to Australia of a Pakistani man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> on the basis of his re-union with immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> relatives in this country and his ability to meet the criteria for migrant entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The idea is to build a united <span class="highlight">family</span> not to have little bits and pieces and enclaves - totally unacceptable and the idea we need to import rural workers at the present time I find extraordinary because living in a rural area myself- 400 miles inland I know what the rural recession of the last 3 years has done to the countryside and the problem is then to get work for people blown off their properties by that recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 8 July1973 of Arthur Augustus Calwell, a member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council, a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great, a member of this House for the division of Melbourne from 1940 to 1972, a Minister of the Crown from 1943 to 1949, Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 195 1 to 1960 and Leader of the Opposition from 1960 to 1967, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the great influences in his life, one should not ignore his special sense of <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although he and I belonged to opposing parties, he remembered members of my <span class="highlight">family</span> and would always make personal inquiries as to how they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a great <span class="highlight">family</span> man, as the Prime Minister has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> were very attached to each other and worked together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was typical of Arthur Calwell ‘s determination and of the co-operation of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of life to Arthur Calwell was the quality of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, of happy communities of people, and of the development of a strong nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like on this occasion to express publicly my deepest sympathy to  Mrs Calwell,  to her daughter Mary Elizabeth, to Arthur’s sisters and to other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with other honourable members in expressing sympathy to his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute to  Mrs Calwell  for the long and wonderful <span class="highlight">family</span> life that they had together and for the many sacrifices which she made to enable Arthur to carry out his very difficult duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, in itself, reveals his great qualities and it is something for which his <span class="highlight">family</span> might justly be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said so much, I join with others in expressing to his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> my deepest sympathy and my respect for a colleague I liked and respected in every way and whose absence I mourn with all other honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 20 June 1973 of Dugald Ranald Ross Munro a member of this House for the division of Eden-Monaro from 1966 to 1969, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The death of a young <span class="highlight">family</span> man of promise must in any circumstances be deeply saddening and, in the appalling circumstances of Dugald Munro ‘s death, most sad, most horrible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> have a very special place in our sympathies as he has in our memories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express my sympathy, and I couple with this expression that of Allan Fraser ‘s, to his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like briefly to pay a tribute to the late Dugald Munro and convey my sympathy to his wife and members of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although he served as a member representing Eden-Monaro, he was a member of a well-known <span class="highlight">family</span> which pioneered the Moree district, which happens to be my home district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I convey my sympathy to his wife and young <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, provision is made for a limited quantity of effects to be transported by air, in addition to the normal accompanied baggage entitlement, where the early return of the items would avoid the necessity for a member and his <span class="highlight">family</span> who are returning by air to occupy motel/hotel accommodation on arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-117-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this scheme any full-time Australian student enrolled in an approved course at either a university, college of advanced education, teachers college, technical college or agricultural college will be able to apply for a living allowance subject to a means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of the adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income at which these maximum allowances will be payable will be increased from $4,200 a year to $5,300 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child from such a <span class="highlight">family</span> is now in an Australian school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was evident from the survey carried out for the previous Government in 1971 that the renunciation was accepted in the simple legal sense, to which there was no objection, but it seemed to be a renunciation of <span class="highlight">family</span> ties, culture and background and therefore was totally unacceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was indicated in the 1971 survey that there was a need then to have a deliberate effort made by the Australian Government to invite people to take out citizenship and join the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation in a more positive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is suggested that the present Opposition should defy the expressed view of the majority of Australian citizens, ignore the distinguished representatives of so many organisations, including the Returned Services League, and take us back to the past and to a hurtful imposition which seems to be required by some either to deter people from joining the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation because they do not want them or to impose hurt for hurt’s sake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could really push the small <span class="highlight">family</span> winery into severe difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to all the factors I have mentioned the <span class="highlight">family</span> wineries will have to meet a far higher taxation bill in the future, following the increase in private company tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that <span class="highlight">family</span> companies in this industry have received the benefit of the private rate of income tax which is applicable to private companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a citizen who must buy land, build a house or rent one, raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>, keep them and himself in health, travel to work, pay State charges, pay municipal charges, pay insurance charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the response of the Government of the day to each of the requests- relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning itemised by him in his reply to me on 30 May 1973 (Hansard, page 2923). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where direct financial commitment by the previous government was concerned, my understanding is that the granting of $10,000 to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Australia in 1972 to assist in sponsoring the First Medical and Scientific Congress of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (part of 1 (iii) to my reply on 30 May 1973 (Hansard, page 2923), was its only response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather the present government took these initiatives on its own account knowing full well the considerable need that had been built up over a number of years for real and direct assistance to the development and provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Australia $200,000 a year from 1 April 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has endeavoured to give every Australian the right to a full education, irrespective of social position or <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> hunted possums, scrounged other food where they could and slept where they could find beds until the local policewoman became aware of their predicament and said they would have to be made wards of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost for the average working man to educate his <span class="highlight">family</span> bears upon him far more heavily than it bears upon anyone else in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to tear it down and restructure it in such a way that it will not discriminate against the low wage earner and the young <span class="highlight">family</span> man as the present scheme does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will hurt the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cost him more to go to his favourite sport or to take his <span class="highlight">family</span> out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the rises that will occur in the prices of cigarettes, beer and spirits, will hit the <span class="highlight">family</span> man more than anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot (take your <span class="highlight">family</span> away to a new environment during that period because your wife cannot get her holidays at the same time’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They brought about an economic system which demands that a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit have at least 2 incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">family</span> in danger of disintegration does not need just marriage guidance counsel alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, the marriage unit and the religious structures are quite different from what they were just one generation ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as it exists today in the nuclear age is hardy recognisable from that unit which existed one generation ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My philosophy is that, if we want to maintain those standards, if we do believe that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is something worth preserving in a country that wishes to have some sort of social stability, we must not lower the standards; but, for goodness sake, we must change our attitudes on how to cope with them and on how to maintain the <span class="highlight">family</span> standard with all the erosions of it that are occurring all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">family</span> dialogue this has 2 results: The child feels superior and is therefore patronising and the parents feel inferior and are therefore aggressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation, consequent upon this Budget, will grossly disadvantage the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party pays lip service to the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm but legislates against it in a highly discriminatory way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is determined that the efficiently managed <span class="highlight">family</span> farm will continue to be the basis of Australian agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of premises that a policy of adjustment can be based on and should include are: That the cost-price squeeze will continue; that an increasing volume of total farm production is consistent with fewer farmers; that economic efficiency of farming is more important to Australia than the number of farmers; that neither the economy nor society needs every farmer as a farmer if over-production of unsaleable products is taking place and better marketing cannot help; that fewer farmers will not mean the end of <span class="highlight">family</span> farming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The best guarantee against corporate farming is viable <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this Budget is a budget to hit the <span class="highlight">family</span> man or the working man whom the Labor Party claims it represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married couple with 2 children - they are the ones who I suggest comprise the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and the people against whom this Budget is directed - who seek non-public hospital accommodation after the Government has nationalised medicine, as it proposes to do on 1 July next will pay more than they do at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As more and more general practitioners join together in group practices and shield themselves from out-of-hours calls behind a barrier of recorded messages, emergency telephone numbers and mobile locum services the old feeling of security which arose from ready access to a <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor is being lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man’s <span class="highlight">family</span> was woken at 1 a.m. when he first became ill and again at 3 a.m. when he was clearly very ill indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The son - I will call him  Mr Smith  - rang the local clinic at which the <span class="highlight">family</span> had been patients over the last 23 years and was told by a recorded voice the name and telephone number of a doctor who is not associated with the clinic but who was said to be available for emergency service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he wants to take his <span class="highlight">family</span> for an outing on the weekend it will cost him more because of the increase in petrol tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know of one <span class="highlight">family</span> of 3 people, each member of which is between 25 and 35 years of age, each of whom paid a 10 per cent deposit on a block of land in addition to purchasing a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A supposed sign of universal affluence is that there is about one car for every 2 people in Australia, yet a Melbourne transportation survey discovered that 63.2 per cent of low income families did not own motor cars whereas 42.8 per cent of high income people owned at least two cars per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of a voluntary health insurance organisation my <span class="highlight">family</span> unit has a number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is stored away by the hospital benefits organisation which keeps on its records the number of claims I have made, the complaints that there have been in my <span class="highlight">family</span> and the categories they come under. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man the increased tax slug of the Budget will be at least $3 a week before the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a case for paying child care allowances to mothers of young children as there is a case for restructuring the tax system in order to achieve equity for the normal <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They, along with the <span class="highlight">family</span> man on the middle or low income, are being made to pay the price for Labor’s inflationary policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the way in which this Budget bears down upon the pensioner and the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  disapproving the Budget for the reasons outlined in that amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government considered that with the changing pattern of immigration into Australia and the Government’s own initiatives in immigration policy giving priority to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and sponsored’ migration it should attain self-sufficiency in respect of movement of migrants and that it was no longer appropriate for Australia to remain a member of ICEM. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I move- (1) That in the opinion of this House, a Federal Judge should be appointed as sole Commissioner In accordance with the provisions of the Royal Commissions Act to inquire into the social, educational and legal aspects of sexual relationships with particular emphasis on the concepts of responsible sexuality, responsible parenthood and <span class="highlight">family</span> life, such inquiry to investigate and evaluate the following matters in Australia and comparable countries and make recommendations for areas within the jurisdiction of the laws of the Australian Parliament: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in the event of failed contraception and consequent unplanned, unwanted pregnancies, the social, psychological and medical results of termination and failure to terminate such pregnancies, and adequacy and effectiveness of existing medico-legal determinations in relation to termination of pregnancy, including the incidence of such terminations, the factors influencing their occurrence, the adequacy of medical training in, and evaluation of methods of termination and the consultative rights of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and other parties to the pregnancy, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be no less appalled by the social, economic, medical and social wefare problems which make of pregnancy not a human joy but an economic disaster for many families, mothers and mother-to-be and by the shortcomings in sex education and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services of which abortion is but one sympton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas 87 per cent of married couples of childbearing age practise <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, only 40 per cent rely for protection upon effective techniques such as oral contraception or the use of an intra-uterine device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should acknowledge that by failing as a society to make proper arrangements for matters such as sex education and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, we have allowed ignorance and irresponsibility to make rich men of many abortionists, parents of many couples who have neither the inclination nor the temperament for parenthood and battered babies of many children of whom it can be said quite literally that they would have been better off if they had never been born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the present Government came into office on 2 December it has provided grants of $225,000 for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, $125,000 for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, $200,000 for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association of Australia and $100,000 for the National Catholic Welfare Committee of Australia which will be repeated as an annual commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we need now is a national approach to the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning along the lines which were being developed in Britain by the public servants and officers of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association with whom I talked 2 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with legitimate criticism of some of the consequences of the 1967 Abortion Act, the British Government has responded not by repealing or amending that Act but by setting up a committee of inquiry under  Mrs Justice  Lane to report upon  those aspects of administration over which abuses have arisen and by upgrading <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services in order to reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Secretary of State for Social Services,  Sir Keith  Joseph, outlined the expansion of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services to the House of Commons on 12 December last year in a very brief statement which I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one hand the Secretary’s statement proposed that <span class="highlight">family</span> planning consultation and advice should be provided without charge for everybody who chooses to take advantage of them, that general practitioners should be encouraged to undertake more <span class="highlight">family</span> planning work and that hospitals should offer more <span class="highlight">family</span> planning advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upshot of this decision is that every municipality in Britain before long will be offering its own <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services in cooperation with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope to see a judicial inquiry take: note of the experience Of the city of Aberdeen where <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services were taken oyer by local government from a voluntary agency in 1946, expanded greatly in the early 1960s and reorganised in 1967 so that advice and contraceptives could be provided without charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent report notes that in Aberdeen the benefits of free and energetic <span class="highlight">family</span> planning ‘have included notable reductions in the birth rate, the fertility rate, high risk maternities, illegitimate birth rate and unwanted pregnancies, while Aberdeen has one of the lowest infant  mortality rates in the world’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason we have tolerated our present inadequate <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services so long is that we have been ignorant as a community of the great advantages conferred by services of a higher standard upon cities such as Aberdeen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An inquiry is needed not only to sweep away that ignorance but also to test the assumptions upon which our present attitudes to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning are based and to open our eyes to the process of innovation which is going on in countries comparable with our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of honourable members have expressed the view that the .terms of reference of which I gave notice originally gave insufficent emphasis to responsible parenthood and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:  in the opinion of this House Commissioners should be appointed to inquire into the <span class="highlight">family</span>, social, education, legal and sexual aspects of male female relationships with particular emphasis on the concept of responsible parenthood, such  enquiry  to investigate and evaluate the following matters in Australia and overseas and make recommendations for areas within the jurisdiction of the laws of the Australian Parliament and further to indicate whether such recom mendations should be implemented through existing bodies or through government instrumentalities to be created: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision, adequacy and effectiveness of existing <span class="highlight">family</span> planning facilities, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater emphasis is required on a range of problems associated with personal development and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> life, which is essential to our social, religious and moral system, has only been recently mentioned in the much changed motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These take their first form in the <span class="highlight">family</span> context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the proposed inquiry to face the question of sexual responsibility in the necessary context of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and of social and economic pressures and their influence on shaping attitudes of responsibility is an index, I believe, of the unrealism of the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A realistic approach to the question is to study precisely those pressures and problems that make it increasingly difficult for the <span class="highlight">family</span> to perform that function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that much evidence emphasised that the prevention of pregnancy in the unmarried teen-age girl is a much more complex problem than can be solved by a simple provision of contraception and that sex education should be provided not as a subject in isolation, but as part of health educational programs, and of education for responsible human relationships and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic social unit, such an inquiry should investigate those problems, their root causes and the aggravating factors that prevent the <span class="highlight">family</span> from performing adequately its rightful function in developing human personality and responsibility in inter-personal relationships and towards parenthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the areas of inquiry should include the social, economic and psychological pressures on <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There certainly should be, as the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews)  said, more informative <span class="highlight">family</span> planning techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us accept this basic principle - we want to preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to see is an inquiry into the circumstances which cause an abortion; the consequences of it; the action required to assist women in avoiding it; the action required to deter people from aiding and abetting it; the adequacy and effectiveness of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning techniques; the action required to ensure that medical practitioners always act in the interests of the woman’s health; the action required to ensure that all services are available free of cost; the action required to establish the necessary supportive services; and, generally, the action required to ensure the preservation of the lives of the mother and her unborn child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are interested in the rights of children as well as the rights of women and the value and worth of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, rather than the concept of sex without responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also want to assist people who want children but whose circumstances are such that <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, even <span class="highlight">family</span> limitation, is not only desirable but also necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how impolitely the honourable member for Hotham may care to label me, I still value the institution df marriage, the trust between marriage partners and the role of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and I see danger in the denigration of moral standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes me concerned to encourage, beginning at medical school as is stated in the amendment, the training of the medical profession in the important role of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and contraceptive counselling, as well as its acceptance of it, because so often it is the doctor lone who has the opportunity which is often denied to parents, friends or other advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes me concerned to see that there is absolute adequacy in the provision of effective, active and fully trained <span class="highlight">family</span> planning advisers, and facilities and clinics available and accessible to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adequacy and availability of contraceptives, advice on contraceptive techniques and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning facilities are most certainly fundamental and at the heart of the inquiry, but the motion itself makes this virtually the total scope of the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There also should be provision for adequate <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, particularly the provision of appropriate child minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple fact is that we cannot make an extra privileged class way above all the other people who are starting off in life building a <span class="highlight">family</span> and building a home and doing all the other things that have to be done by a young <span class="highlight">family</span> - sending children to school, clothing them and the rest of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member seeks to justify this upon the basis that this remedy had to be taken in order to achieve equity between the pensioner and the young <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the way the problem should have been dealt with was for the tax threshold, as it applies to the young <span class="highlight">family</span> man, to be lifted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet if one looks at the report of the Coombs task force one sees that there is some suggestion that the Government is looking at the question of lowering the income at which young <span class="highlight">family</span> men shall begin to pay tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an inequity so far as the young <span class="highlight">family</span> man is concerned, there are those of us on this side of the House who have urged for a long time that the tax threshold - the point at which tax first becomes payable - should be looked at across the broad spectrum of all taxpayers and not in the manner in which this legislation is proposed to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, he was consistently following the <span class="highlight">family</span> tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the more touching scenes in Adelaide was the annual pilgrimage to the <span class="highlight">family</span> cherry orchard where tea and sympathy were copiously distributed amongst pensioners toy his father, but there was never a vote by him in support of amendments moved here in support of pension increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this does point up is the fact that there is a serious defect in the argument that the conventional concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor being available for such impossible hours will not stand up and weakens, of course, some of the case that some people are trying to make on behalf of the medical profession in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main provisions in these treaties to which I refer are: Extradition is provided for in respect of extradition offences committed extra territorially; an offence against the law relating to genocide, referred to in the Genocide Convention Act 1949, as well as the taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his or her <span class="highlight">family</span> are not to be considered as crimes of a political character; a very important change has been made to the speciality rule so that an extradited person may be dealt with by the requesting country or be surrendered to a third state for offences other than those upon which the extradition was based where consent is given by the executive authority of the requested country; delivery at the time of surrender of any article that may be material evidence in proving an offence to which the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive relates; the custody of a fugitive who is in transit from one state to a third state; in the case of the United States of America, provision is made for the extradition for federal offences where there is an additional element in the extradi tion offence of such matters as the use of interstate facilities or use of mails or transporting across the borders of states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But last night the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  told us on television that the Government was going to control every item that makes up the daily cost of living of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the charging of rents below par for company owned houses in which they live; generous expense accounts which are made available; extravagant superannuation schemes which are for the privileged few; the business trips to Honolulu and elsewhere on which the <span class="highlight">family</span> is taken along and which consists of one 10-minute interview - the total cost is on the house; the payment of school fees for children under company executive scholarship schemes; and the provision of motor cars and the payment of running costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, when the means test is applied, the point at which the scholarship begins to reduce is at $4,200 a year adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income, and the point at which the minimum grant of $150 is made is at $5,375 adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has in fact subsequently informed me that he was not present at that meeting because he was attending a <span class="highlight">family</span> funeral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was saying before I was interrupted, we find a peculiar circumstance whereby the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> who buys meat on the home market is charged but the purchaser overseas - or the exporter - does not have to pay a service charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the average Australian worker wants his <span class="highlight">family</span>’s economic life disrupted by hardship caused through strikes, any more than he wants it caused by unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly hope that he will because it is not in the best interests of anybody, much less the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, to be out on strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make it very plain and I stress again that what we must do at all times is to invite people to join us - not to be the shock troops in this or that operation, but to invite people to join us as permanent settlers and members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we seriously intend to allow them to follow their own rules in their domestic and <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs, and to adapt their style of life in ways and at speeds of their own choice and not ours - a principle to which the previous Government pledged itself - we must open to them fully the path of their own wisdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, my indignation was absolute when I found that some people had intervened in a manner which seemed to constitute a breach of trust with the Brown <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity if, after an Aboriginal child grows up with a white <span class="highlight">family</span>, its parents, for some reason or other, say that they want the child returned to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is a great need for these children, who may come from an illiterate <span class="highlight">family</span>, whose mother and father have had no formal education, who possibly live in a humpy with earth floors and no water or electricity laid on to it, who are without the advantage of a television set, a radio or even a clock in the house, as is frequently the case, and who cannot take school books home because there is nowhere to put them where the smaller children will not get at them and destroy them, to be brought into a pre-school situation, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Ashley Brown). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who are over 16 years of age can take some comfort from the fact which I have just quoted from the New York <span class="highlight">Family</span> Health Magazine of March 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such accommodation provides somewhere to go for people who have been displaced from the <span class="highlight">family</span> home, and to ask them to contribute anything but a nominal amount would be asking them for something which was beyond their capacity to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From them, by the opportunity they present for people to meet in suitable and peaceful surroundings, these people draw strength and renewed confidence and enthusiasm to resist the pressures that are thrust on them from economic, social, health and <span class="highlight">family</span> worries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As all the evidence to hand at the present time supports the contention that school administrators and educational experts, armed with vast resources, are unable to overcome the disadvantages of the <span class="highlight">family</span> background, one step towards this end would be increased government assistance to the adult migrant education program, by sponsoring on television imported Italian, Greek, Spanish or Turkish variety programs, as well as adventure programs, that have met with success in terms of popularity overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the functions of these voluntary bodies I think one comes to this conclusion: First, the Government, through its system of social services - age pensions, <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment, widows’ pensions and the other payments that it makes - should be able to make certain that nobody in the Australian community is left below a certain level of poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it involves the age pension, the widow’s pension or <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment, it is the citizen’s right; it is not charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although time will not permit me to develop this point now, I believe that the most important major and massive social problem which lies before the Department of Social Security is providing help for the young and the forming <span class="highlight">family</span>, especially in the lower income brackets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now are faced with the much more massive problem which goes right to the root of our social structure, namely, of help for the young and the forming <span class="highlight">family</span> and, particularly, help for the young couple at the time of the birth of their first child or in the provision of the matrimonial home which is desirable at all times but becomes, I believe, necessary when the first child is born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housewife has to make her dollars stretch each week to purchase the requirements of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the home and when housewives find that these costs are continually moving up, every day and every week, as they have been doing in more recent times, they will start to think about the policies which the Government is implementing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot quote from previous speeches made by the Treasurer, but I can remember the Treasurer himself sitting at the table when he was in opposition and pointing to the very problem which I am raising tonight, that is, the future survival of the small businesses, the small <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses and the small co-operatives throughout the length and breadth of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The scheme that was introduced of allocating finance to a coloured <span class="highlight">family</span> for every child that attended a secondary school offset this to some extent, but I know that in some instances the child only attends secondary school in order that the <span class="highlight">family</span> gets the benefit of the finance, and not because of any desire to further his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ought to be sufficient for over 1,100 houses, which would roughly equal what we believe to be the annual rate of <span class="highlight">family</span> formation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government established a special study group of Commonwealth and State health authorities which recommended a co-ordinated program covering establishment of local health committees, delivery of health care - including much wider deployment of doctors and community health nurses - administrative re-organisation, education, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, research and other special programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member for Wannon and those who, like him, try to undermine the process by which these facts could regularly be brought under public scrutiny have any comprehension of the misery of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the child when defects of speech get steadily worse over a number of years while that child is waiting for treatment and none can be provided for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is really beyond the power of the Schools Commission but certainly we can tackle the disadvantages of being born into an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> rather than a white <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that the small investor, the pensioner, the widower or the widow with a large <span class="highlight">family</span> and the youth who is just starting on the long journey through life should have had a much higher interest rate applied to their deposits which, because they are usually under $4,000, attract the very lowest rate of 3J per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is more appropriate and better for the future of the Australian ethos if a person on his initial entry into the home ownership field can buy a home that will be suitable for him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> for the rest of his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We maintain that one of the greatest bulwarks of the maintenance of the Australian way of life is for each <span class="highlight">family</span> unit to possess an individual home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some form of rental allowance could be considered in these circumstances whereby on the <span class="highlight">family</span> income a low income <span class="highlight">family</span> could rent good quality accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This enables the not-so-well-paid <span class="highlight">family</span> to have the ability to obtain a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where the <span class="highlight">family</span> includes more than 2 children this limit can be increased by $2 a week for each child after the second child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We realise that a contented <span class="highlight">family</span> is one that has a home, whether rented or owned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premiers and the State Ministers for Housing - Labor, Liberal and Country Party - really dug their toes in when the Minister proposed this course of action, which went against all the traditions, birthrights and ambitions of the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> to own their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At last some assistance is to be given to the low income earner who wants to provide shelter for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government let the private financial institutions do what they liked and it regulated the economy by turning the screw on the low income earner who was trying to provide shelter for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time when a <span class="highlight">family</span> buys a house, in the early years of home repayments the repayment forms an inordinately high percentage of that <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would take some of the burden off the young <span class="highlight">family</span> which has many other commitments in trying to pay off a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that price is upheld it will have to be passed on to every poor <span class="highlight">family</span> which goes to live in Tuggeranong, the new satellite city being built to the south of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Early diagnosis and treatment, social support and follow-up will be closer to the approach of the old village doctor, parish priest or other traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at this stage I would also make a very special plea for extra grants for library books for external study centres of the university such as we have in Toowoomba where, through the generosity of the Boyce <span class="highlight">family</span> and a group of supporters, a substantial external centre of the Queensland University will be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their fees simply cover their costs and, with the wage increases and galloping inflation which have come about since the Labor Government came to power, the fees are fast becoming beyond the reach of the average <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our predominantly conformist, overtly masculine society, fixed on the 2-child nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> mushrooming in suburban wastelands, the homosexual is an unwelcome outsider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that pretty soon we must come to the time when if, for any reason - technological change, alterations in tariff policies, mergers or any other reason - a worker is required to change his job he will require support to ensure that he does not lose anything in wages, he will require support in retraining and he may even require support in re-housing and moving himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to a place more convenient to his employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A complete dislocation to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and tribal tie-ups is occurring in some areas because of this money being made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask those honourable members to think for themselves: How many of them could look after their wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> on an advance for living at the rate of $2,200 a year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely to goodness people in this House do not think that it is possible for a man and his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> to exist at that level, even for only food and clothing, for 12 months in this day and age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they had any comprehension of these problems they would do something effective to control inflation and something effective to protect the position of the average <span class="highlight">family</span> person in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the things that comes to my mind when I listen to the class-conscious utterances of the Australian Labour Party is that thinking people recognise that in children who are being educated in our society differences in potential arise from biological inheritance, <span class="highlight">family</span> background and aspirations, influence of school and church and wider influences of the media and society at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This campaign is endeavouring to incite people to make a nuisance of themselves by ringing my home and upsetting my <span class="highlight">family</span> life about something over which I have no control, something which is the responsibility of previous Liberal governments at the Federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hear so much about law and order, yet this leaflet is asking people to make a nuisance of themselves and upset my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should take up the slack in times of stress but that we should not be making the pace and ensuring that other areas of administration - State parliaments and local governments - and individual families and the people themselves have less in materials, in time and certainly in money with which to carry out the work that they want carried out for their own personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Budget, in my own area, 4 new juicing plant projects have reached the stage of negotiating for finance, another <span class="highlight">family</span> firm project is under way and another is in the process of formulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also applaud moves to provide facilities not only for treatment but also for the rehabilitation of the patient and indeed the whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We applaud this modern day approach to this problem of treating these people initially in their homes where no embarrassment is felt and where, through the participation of the whole of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the healthy environment that is created, the patient can probably readjust himself and overcome his problem, whether it be an inability to cope, a problem with drink or a problem with drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully, we are now moving away from the prehistoric age concept where someone who was mentally ill or suffering from a disease or a sickness such as alcoholism or drug dependency had to be locked up away from the community, where a stigma was cast on the <span class="highlight">family</span> if a member of that <span class="highlight">family</span> was an alcoholic or mentally ill, whether that person acquired that mental illness or was bom with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our understanding is that the Government is to provide living allowances on a different basis, that they will not be provided on any basis of scholarship but purely on the basis of <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that on the basis of payment of living allowance to people in universities the matter to be assessed is really the basis of the <span class="highlight">family</span> income - the nature of the means test - and therefore whether or not a particular student ought to be paid an allowance under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, what place has academic progress in the payment of a living allowance based on <span class="highlight">family</span> income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our method for scholarship holders, as the House knows, was to pay all fees and to pay the living allowance for those who came within a <span class="highlight">family</span> quired for education, despite what this Government would argue that its proposal provides greater support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the students of low <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes, the living allowance will still be the only funds available to them to get through university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these arrangements, if the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is sufficiently inadequate a student will qualify for the living allowance, again very much on the same basis as before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this scheme any student is eligible for a living allowance, subject to a means test of <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also the level of <span class="highlight">family</span> income at which the maximum allowance can be paid will be lifted from $4,200 to $5,300 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in the Budget Speech it was outlined that the maximum allowance of $304 would be payable where the adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income did not exceed $3,100 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the Australian Union of Students estimated that in 1972 a <span class="highlight">family</span> on an average income of $4,200 would spend 30 per cent of this in sending one child to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The notion that social levels should reflect differences in innate ability rather than differences in <span class="highlight">family</span> was part of the democratic revolution which accompanied industrialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The benefit will be subject to a means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The arrangement should facilitate <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So Australian business, Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise, in the last quarter of a century has suffered from the lack of protection which is implicit in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against this background the need for protection of the Australian consumer, housewife and <span class="highlight">family</span> is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary I believe that, as understood at the moment and without real qualifications and amendments, the Bill will, if enacted, do great harm to those who really matter, that is, the people of this country - the consumer, the <span class="highlight">family</span>, mum and dad and the kids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is the Government trying to do what it can to stabilize land prices so that the average <span class="highlight">family</span> can purchase a home at reasonable cost and the Opposition parties are doing their best to sabotage the Government’s actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the subsidised health benefits plan further expanded so that those on the lower scales of income could be phased into the voluntary funds at discounted premiums which would be related to such factors as <span class="highlight">family</span> income and number of dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this <span class="highlight">family</span> would pay more under Labor to join the scheme and, in addition, would pay $147 a week for every week in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a <span class="highlight">family</span> where the wife is working, the break-even point is in excess of $10,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person who is ill at present may like a particular doctor, but the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget may not be going as well as it might be because of the inflation that we are all complaining about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the tragic case of those children who are totally dependent on their parents and the other members of their <span class="highlight">family</span>, no amount of affection can ever overcome the despair which is generated by the totality of their demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But in her absolute and complete innocence, she is unable to communicate in any way at all, but she knows’ her own familiar things and, as a loved member of her <span class="highlight">family</span>, is intended to remain in that circle of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is not a good practice to continue these descriptions when people have joined the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation; they are citizens and they should be regarded as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only is the effect of inflation to put up the cost of house building, but also it becomes very difficult for the lowincome <span class="highlight">family</span> to secure suitable accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A motherless child’s allowance could also be paid in respect of children who are in the custody of their father either because their mother is dead or because she has deserted the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and has left the children uncared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a terrible hardship for a man who has lost his wife - even by desertion and much worse if he has lost her by death - to find that he is placed in a financial position in which he has to break up his young <span class="highlight">family</span> and perhaps lose contact with his dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is to be a breakup during the week days at least there should be provision whereby under such circumstances the <span class="highlight">family</span> could be reunited at the weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I reiterate what I said before and that is that the most massive problem that lies in front of us - not the most acute but the most massive - in the field of social services is, I think, help for the young couple with a forming <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the position of a couple starting a marriage with 2 incomes coming into the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, when their income diminishes, the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If our social structure is to become secure we must think not only of the young people but also primarily of the young people with a forming <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But young people with a forming <span class="highlight">family</span> are a class of people who are due for real assistance when the social security program is expanded, as I believe it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A paper “The Deserted Father, A Study of his Problems’ by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee of the Victorian Council of Social Service, Melbourne, on this subject had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Successful rehabilitation of an incapacitated member can mean a lot to that member’s dignity and pride and could be the means of enabling him to become a useful member of the community and of greater assistance and value to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the opinion - and that is my problem - that where a member has a terminal disease, a problem of mental health, or some incapacity due to previous venereal disease infection, the reasons for his claim’s rejection as not being due to war service should be guarded, coded or clouded in some way - I do not care how it is done - in order to avoid embarrassment to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Minister went on to say that a comparable <span class="highlight">family</span> on $400 a week pays $52 a year after tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, there will not be a large section of the population at risk, so to speak, faced with the disaster of large hospital and medical costs if any member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> falls ill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Cabinet, frankly, has not got round to considering this issue, although I am told that, in view of the testimonial by the Minister for Northern Development on his own behalf and going back 2 generations in his <span class="highlight">family</span>, the consumption of sugar by members of this House has risen amazingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With one exception, none of the powers proposed to be transferred by the referendum will benefit the people of this country in a personal way, as was done in 1946 in the amendment, by referendum, to section 51 (XXIII  a)  of the Constitution which conferred power on the Australian Parliament to make provision for such benefits as child endowment, unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we expect local councils to provide facilities over a wide new field, such as infant welfare centres, pre-school centres, libraries, a multiplicity of sporting facilities, meals-on-wheels, <span class="highlight">family</span> guidance clinics, open space, home-help services, social workers, welfare officers and youth workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that any policy designed to achieve this must establish land use priorities because in my opinion the great majority of that section of our wildlife population which is under threat - and this applies to and includes quite a number of species of the kangaroo <span class="highlight">family</span> - is threatened not because of hunting but because of the spread of civilisation which has gradually encroached on and eroded its habitat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that possibly onethird of Australia’s total population is linked either directly by birth or less directly .by <span class="highlight">family</span> or marriage to the history, language, culture and traditions of an overseas country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically the information used for the purposes of that exercise comes from the Bureau of Census and Statistics pub lication ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Income 1969’ which was published quite recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is particularly true in the case of <span class="highlight">family</span> companies many of which have taxable incomes of less than $10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in private company tax rates combined with an effective increase in personal taxation plus the enforced distribution of a significant part of trading profits, particularly for <span class="highlight">family</span> companies, places strains on liquidity and inhibits the growth of this type of company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a contract of life assurance has superimposed upon its terms a set of tax rules entirely different from those existing when the contract was made, those most seriously affected would be the parties to or the beneficiaries under a contract providing for the payment of a sum of money upon a life assured attaining a certain age or upon prior death, i.e., upon those who have made provision for their own personal security or that of their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These reasons could include the resale of a residential property to acquire another property with different accommodation for reasons of personal illness, additional unexpected <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities such as aged parents, multiple births and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him to look further at this provision because, in cases of this type, the proceeds from the sale of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home are completely reinvested in a replacement property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>places inflexible rules on the sale of property which take no account nf reasons unconnected with profit motives such as illness and additional <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities; ff) impedes the development of small businesses  by  increasing the rates of private company tax, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a blatant attempt by these people who talk of a 35-hour week - which at the right and proper time I do not condemn - to reimpose on the primary producer long hours and the necessity for slave labour where the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> has to return to an unprivileged status of yesteryear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not overstating the position to say that it will almost certainly threaten some manufacturers, particularly some <span class="highlight">family</span> companies that are hit by other sections of this Budget, with hardship and even threaten bankruptcy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a property is bought and sold within 15 months or 2 years, of course, the profit is not assessable for taxation purposes unless the Commissioner of Taxation decides in terms of section 26a of the income tax legislation that the profits are part of the general income earning performance of a <span class="highlight">family</span> or an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the whole of the profits would have to be distributed the incorporated partnership concept is likely to be attractive only to the <span class="highlight">family</span> or small scale enterprise and would be an alternative to partnership and not to public company status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that basis there is value in keeping the retention allowance, but of course where it is not applicable - and I believe it is unfortunate that it will be retained - is to the companies which are of a <span class="highlight">family</span> company nature or of smaller companies with an income of less than $30,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This afternoon, however, I wish to deal with 3 of those items and they are those lettered (a) where we say that we are most unhappy because the Bill imposes unwarranted taxes on pensioners; (e) because it places inflexible rules on the sale of property which take no account of reasons unconnected with profit motives, such as illness or additional <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities; and (g) because it places added cost burdens on Australia’s wine and brandy producers, especially the smaller producers of wine grapes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the general level, at the threshhold for the young <span class="highlight">family</span> or the young income earner, we have this absurdly high rate of marginal tax payable which is destroying all incentive to work to gain an income above that level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn to the words of an old friend who told me that the common denominator of religious faiths was the belief in the brotherhood and sisterhood of mankind and that those professing religious affiliations cannot show a better attitude to others than by application of brotherly love in positive discrimination on a needs basis to children who must overcome financial, social and even <span class="highlight">family</span> background problems, among their own, other religions and non-believers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other things include their attitude to work, to study and to the reading of books, whether the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> talk together at night and educate each other in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our belief that health is a <span class="highlight">family</span> affair and a community affair and that communities must look beyond the person who is sick in bed or who is in need of medical attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I still see as one of the major problems facing agriculture in Australia the question of how the minimal living area for a man, his wife and his <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will have effective decentralisation, we will guarantee the opportunity of the man on the land, the proprietor of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm, to stay where he is only through policies of concentrated development which scatter growth centres across this country on a systematic basis so that appropriate opportunities for recreation, for employment and for education are accessible to Australians wherever it is they may live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that there should be no unearned increment; the savings should be passed on to the person who purchased the land so that the cost of providing a house for his <span class="highlight">family</span> will be lower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that a Bill such as this which literally affects every <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia should be debated while the proceedings are being broadcast and that there should Be a maximum time allowed for debate so that honourable members on both sides of the House can exercise their right to speak on this proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, there is need in Newcastle for a new medical school which should be developed at the University of Newcastle in association with the hospitals in the area and centred on the Royal Newcastle Hospital for the following reasons: The supply of potential teaching beds; the size of the existing medical schools in Sydney; the population distribution; the general desirability of decentralisation and the orientation towards social medicine and <span class="highlight">family</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There might be good <span class="highlight">family</span> reasons or other reasons why it should not be made public, so I do not press the Minister to the point of agreeing that nothing shall be excluded, but rather I ask him to examine that aspect of the matter because I believe it to be an important point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This device could have saved the lives of 3 young children of a <span class="highlight">family</span> a week or two ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With reference to the case of  Mrs King  of Canberra and her efforts to adopt her foster child, Kelly, will the Minister investigate the situation with a view to maintaining what is now a happy <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-54-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, before any transfers are made, consideration is given to the position of each member including his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With private companies, because there was a limited number of shareholders who often were closely knit on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis, it was easy for the income of a private company to bear less tax than it would have borne if it had been earned by a partnership or by individual activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is better than what is being suggested that where there is a declining area we should insist that a postmaster and his <span class="highlight">family</span> should remain in that area when perhaps they do not want to remain there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British people love the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> as their own and honour them for what they are - a wonderful example to each and every one - through war and peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is human nature for a person to conclude: ‘Well, if the Government is compulsorily adding to my taxes in order to provide me and my <span class="highlight">family</span> with free hospitalisation then I will use it and get my money’s worth.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received estimates from various funds of what it will cost a <span class="highlight">family</span> man in addition to the 1.35 per cent supertax he will be forced to pay on his taxable income to insure for his wife, <span class="highlight">family</span> and himself for intermediate or private bed accommodation in a private hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates - it is impossible to get an accurate cost - range from $80 to $125 per annum extra in insurance costs to entitle him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to a bed in a private hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the young <span class="highlight">family</span> man on a middle sized income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an intolerable situation for any young <span class="highlight">family</span> to find itself in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a driver now pays $133 for private ward accommodation for himself and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the technical area, of course, the consumer of health care is not able to know precisely the details of the specialist or technical treatment that he is receiving, and here his relationship with his <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor is important because the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor is, if you like, his health broker who acts for him in the market place of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian on an average, ordinary income, whose wife works, will immediately pay more to get the type and quality of health care which presently he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> are receiving in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that the example I have given is the <span class="highlight">family</span> right in the middle of the spectrum in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the whole theme of the Government’s alternative proposal is to forget what has been done over so many years in the reform of the health care system in Australia, is to foist on Australia a philosophy which, as I have described, is part of the fag end of an old socialist era, is to be immediately more costly for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia and is in the long term to lead to a rundown in total community resources devoted to health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite plain that it simply does not believe health care services are a right which should be enjoyed by everybody and that instead it wants to ensure that health services should be marketed as a commodity and be available according to the financial resources of each person and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A case brought to my notice recently concerned 2 members of the one <span class="highlight">family</span> - one of whom is an aged person and both of whom have been receiving prolonged treatment from a specialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any discussion on health must consider the following 5 areas: Firstly, the individual and his <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities - I know that the Labor Government denies anyone individuality; it thinks people are mere cogs in a machine; secondly, the medical profession in its widest application; thirdly, hospitals - public, private, religious and charitable; fourthly, government responsibility; and fifthly, health insurance schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best judge of the necessary medical attention is the patient’s doctor - best of all the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the economy of Toowoomba - and of Queensland as my colleague the honourable member for Fisher  (Mr Adermann)  reminds me - depends to a large extent on this magnificent <span class="highlight">family</span> partner ship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inflation will have immense economic and, more importantly perhaps, immense social consequences for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and for the peace and happiness of the young <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will also operate to the disadvantage of many single taxpayers who at present pay only half the rates that are paid by a married man with a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this scheme single taxpayers will pay the same rate as a married man with a <span class="highlight">family</span> pays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  personally find quite unacceptable a system whereby the man who drives my Commonwealth car in Sydney pays twice as much for the same <span class="highlight">family</span> cover as  I  have, not despite the fact that my income is four or five times higher than his, but precisely because of my higher income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would still see a constant repetition of the example I quoted in my 1972 policy speech - the example of a car driver paying twice as much for the same <span class="highlight">family</span> cover as a man whose income is four or five times higher than his. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point is that Queenslanders - and I know that this applies to the rest of Australia - at present enjoy a system in which if the husband works and belongs to a medical benefits fund his contribution covers the entire <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community interest and involvement in this area have increased our awareness of the need for a complex and imaginative program which, along with day care centres and pre-schools, might also include <span class="highlight">family</span> day care programs, play-groups and neighbourhood ‘drop-in’ centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Opposition we agree with the philosophy of the Bill because what it does is establish community health centres - sometimes with salaried doctors or salaried paramedical personnel - in those areas where people are poor, where people cannot understand if they or members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> become ill, where they can go for medical advice and medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One reason is that the Australian fishing industry traditionally has been a small business operation - very often a <span class="highlight">family</span> business - with limited capital and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen in the year that is behind us many moves which could be interpreted in that way - moves which on the surface seem fair and reasonable and attractive enough but when they are put together into a pattern seem to move towards this funda mental Government objective of destroying the Australian States, destroying every other form of democratic government and centralising everything here in Canberra in one House of Parliament so that the man who obtained the Prime Ministership by some quirk or chance of fate will be able to perpetuate his power, be able to over-ride everything in the Constitution and have complete control of the whole Australian economy, social structure, <span class="highlight">family</span> life and everything else that one can imagine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I trust that his <span class="highlight">family</span> will accept my sincere condolences and the expression of sympathy which come from my <span class="highlight">family</span>, from the good friends of his old electorate and especially of his home town of Ipswich and which of course will be endorsed by honourable members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measures that have been introduced include grants of up to $3,000 per <span class="highlight">family</span> for immediate relief and emergency house repairs, grants of up to $15,000 for major repair or rebuilding of private homes, loans to flood affected primary producers and business firms for whom needed finance is not available from normal commercial sources and grants to local authorities for restoration of their assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will the Minister reconsider the suspension in view of the advantages of the system in facilitating <span class="highlight">family</span> visits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that these provisions will encourage the States to refer to this Parliament powers such as <span class="highlight">family</span> law, defamation and shipping and navigation which, in this context, have been raised at the Constitutional Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, I point to the voting figures in the division in question, which were 57 votes for the Government and 51 votes for the Opposition - indicating that in view of the fact that the Government had 67 members in attendance or, allowing for yourself  Mr Speaker,  66 votes, 9 Government members missed the division hut only 3 Opposition members missed it, as we had 3 members away due to their own illness or illness in the <span class="highlight">family</span> and our Leader, the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden),  did not vote at any time today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He sought reference by the 6 State parliaments with respect to 14 matters ranging from <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, air transport, uniformity of railway gauge, organised marketing of commodities, uniform company taxation, uniform company law - name it and it is virtually to be found there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the honourable member’s concern because the Weber <span class="highlight">family</span> lives in his area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can one place some valuation on the grief experienced by the <span class="highlight">family</span> whose home and all its contents were washed away? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Monday of this week my attention was drawn to the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> who had been insured with the State Government Insurance Office, which is controlled by the Queensland Government of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all Australians were pleased to welcome the Queen and Prince Philip, together with some of their <span class="highlight">family</span>, to Australia and were particularly pleased that the Queen opened this session of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is an enormous number of people, particularly young people, who are incapable of relating to the society or the social unit in which they find themselves - whether that be the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the marriage or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average wage earner is certainly being very badly hit as he tries to support his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has made the means test so much harder to meet that it is almost impossible for a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which the wife chooses to work to qualify because the <span class="highlight">family</span> income is taken into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government talks about an assessed, seasonal or adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income, which allows for a deduction of $300 for every child undergoing full time primary or secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a fairly shabby trick for somebody who professes to be a republican to try to hang on to the coat tails of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that the husband of the lady who wrote to me about this matter is not in good health and the <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned that the son should be allowed to come to Australia before anything of a fatal nature happens to the father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is some reason - frankly, I could not appreciate why there would be a reason - why this lad and his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> are not able to come to Australia and if that reason could be given, further discussion and representation could take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the matter will be brought to fruition very quickly and that the man, his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> will be allowed to come out and join his parents in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in fact a delay of about 6 months in the finallisation of many of the matters concerning people coming from overseas, whether they are individuals or <span class="highlight">family</span> groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were not able to communicate with the people concerned because the case involved a very close member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> having a very unhappy and miserable disease which it was not our responsibility to advise or to make known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is very often necessary to try to go through a drill which will, in the first instance, safeguard the Australian community from susceptibility to the disease and, secondly, safeguard the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, of course, there was the willing response of the Federal Government in regard to the providing of immediate relief for families amounting to $3,000 a <span class="highlight">family</span> and $15,000 a household in respect of major repairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first point I should like to make in relation to Fiji is that we have some 4,000 residents from Fiji and a good percentage of them have settled so successfully and so well they have joined the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation as Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proud of the Fijian settlers who have come through our front door and become part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They establish a bridgehead, they introduce their dupes and they keep them in bondage for years to pay for return fares they never had in the first place, for accommodation - up to 17 to a room - they were never consulted about, and for services rendered in beating Australia’s laws designed above all to prevent exploitation and to preserve standards for all people in the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are always delighted to have  Her  Majesty the Queen and any member of her <span class="highlight">family</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more difficult today to buy a house for a <span class="highlight">family</span> using finance from traditional sources because of the high interest charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> on the average income has no chance of getting finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have no intention of rushing in with a heavy-handed approach and flattening out the economy with damaging recessionary policies which hit the <span class="highlight">family</span> man hardest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite talk about the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That hits the unskilled, the low income earner and the’ <span class="highlight">family</span> man first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the introduction on 1 December 1973 of the reforms in the acquisition of citizenship and a public campaign inviting settlers to become members of the national <span class="highlight">family</span> by seeking Australian citizenship, applications are running at more than 20 per cent above the previous level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday night the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock)  mentioned the case of a nomination by parents at present resident in Australia of a son and his <span class="highlight">family</span> remaining in an overseas country and a request they had made for assisted passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His second complaint was that this case was straightforward and should not have taken this length of time to determine, that the parents were in ill-health and that they wanted the son and <span class="highlight">family</span> to join them, that this should not be delayed and the assisted passage should be granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has had 2 firm replies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So he has done a service in raising it, as it would seem that there is a need to plug the gap in the system of advice so the member and the <span class="highlight">family</span> are both advised and the member who initiates the matter is not overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the complaint about the intending migrant and the receipt by him of an assisted passage I must remind the House of my words the other night, that behind the bland reply to a <span class="highlight">family</span> often lies a tale which is better left untold for their peace of mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned lodged the nomination of their son and his <span class="highlight">family</span> from a capital city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She told the honourable member there was ill health in the <span class="highlight">family</span> and of course this gave edge to his concern, and I acknowledge it, but the son said the parents were both in good health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that within the very generous criteria laid down the decision was sound not only in the interests of Australia but also in the interests of the parents and I might say in the interests of the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where he lives in the world there is no lack of employment at present and if he makes an effort and works for a change, stays out of gaol and pays attention to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and applies again I will always be happy and I am sure any of my successors will always he happy to reconsider the decision, but on the present basis I am sorry the answer has to be no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that to burden ageing parents with such a <span class="highlight">family</span> - a man, wife and 5 children would be too much, even if I had the authority to spend Australian taxpayers’ money on such a case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He vividly remembers the incident because it obliged him to forgo an evening at home with his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion cases is the Government limiting the migrant intake from all countries to skilled tradesmen or higher qualifications or are unskilled people still coming into the country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there could be 3 brothers in the one <span class="highlight">family</span> with different criteria applied to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only in this morning’s newspaper that the Treasurer tells the people of Australia that this scheme will work only on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true, as alleged at the weekend, that there is difficulty in breaking down the figures for <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion migrants and those arriving under the national need category because the biggest group of migrants arriving in Australia is completely uncontrolled, unselected and indeed not even interviewed, that is, migrants from Britain, Canada and New Zealand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These employees’ eligibility for assistance under the “low income <span class="highlight">family</span>” provisions of the National Health Act was in no way affected by their direct participation in an industrial dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six were rejected; three because they were from single persons who did not comprise a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, and three because the combined <span class="highlight">family</span> income exceeded the allowable limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applicants whose <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income does not exceed $69.50 a wek are eligible for assistance under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing the criterion of low income is met, my Department is not required to concern itself with why the income is low, however, in determining the level of <span class="highlight">family</span> income, acount is taken of the past income and the likely future income of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To prove the substance I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows that the greatest benefit of this loan deductibility will be to the single man and not the man who has dependants or <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basically important question of population control, there has been steady progress but no noteworthy new breakthrough or assessment in the field of demography and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning As the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported in 1972: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is increasing evidence that sufficiently widespread motivation for limiting <span class="highlight">family</span> size cannot be produced without more families becoming aware that their standard of living is rising, including benefiting from a higher level of education, especially for women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In India, for example, the population has grown by more than 100 million people in 10 years, during which time a fairly concentrated <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program has been under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been asked by a number of people the income effects of Professor Henderson’s proposals relating to child endowment and the removal of tax concessions for various <span class="highlight">family</span> income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it might be handy for purposes of the record if I indicate here the order of costs involved in increasing child endowment, for example by $1 a week for all children according to their place in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deep point of philosophy and even pragmatism is involved here because it can be well and truly argued that child endowment for the first child for different philosophical reasons should be higher than for, say, the second child because quite often the first child is far more costly to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit than the second child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that members of the Parliament and also the public should know exactly what is being spent and in which direction because there are so many hidden subsidies in the tax concessions system that the Parliament at no stage knows exactly by how much it is subsidising a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, the farmers or any other group in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around the same time, at the Tokyo conference the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that the Australian Government would be looking at ways in which some of its current aid effort, especially in areas of population, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning, transport and communications, might be linked with the work of some of the regional projects sponsored by that Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since taking office the Government has broken much new ground in the aid field, such as accepting a commitment to the United Nations target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to foreign aid and contributing to international activities in the field of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gets to the point where, at a meeting I had last Monday, a young woman with young children told me that the burden of taxes and prices on her <span class="highlight">family</span> was such that though she did not want to do it - she wanted to remain home with her young children - in order to preserve her <span class="highlight">family</span>’s standard of living she was going to be forced to take employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason is that it is human nature for a person to conclude: ‘Well, if the Government is adding to my taxes to provide me and my <span class="highlight">family</span> with free hospitalisation I may as well use it and get my money’s worth.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In contrast to the Government’s policies the thrust of our housing policy is designed to help those who need it most - young couples and single people seeking their first home and new home owners in the first years of paying off their loans when the financial burdens are heaviest on the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bankruptcy is a case in point; so too are taxation, trade practices, <span class="highlight">family</span> law, industrial property and a wide range of matters arising out of laws made by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The taking over of <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction now exercised by the State Supreme Courts under the federal legislation should not of itself increase the total number of judges required to administer that jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would emphasise that the placing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction in a special division of the Superior Court will permit the appointment as judges of that division of lawyers who are particularly qualified to exercise jurisdiction in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member for Wentworth and the Minister for Manufacturing Industry will be able to ease my mind as to whether this legislation would break down if Barton were to be brought into court in Brazil in relation to his extradition to Australia, with his skilled and wise lawyer,  Mr Gruzman,  Q.C., who recently flew to Brazil to interview him, and if Barton were to say: ‘I have Margaret Abertito in the <span class="highlight">family</span> way’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that puts in proper perspective what 1 have been contending, namely, that the $250 rebate will be not for every one of the one million families but for the average <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This shows how higher taxation is hitting right at the heart of the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If the Government is not prepared to do that, it will be the average Australian worker, the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> and the Australian housewife who suffer as - I am sure the Minister understands this - unemployment begins to loom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need for the national Government to involve itself, not by directly overseeing urban development projects and becoming a giant landlord and developer, but by providing additional funds to local government for capital works programs such as day and child care centres, recreational and care centres for children both after school and during holiday periods; parks, gardens and flora and fauna reserves; <span class="highlight">family</span> and community counselling facilities, particularly among migrant communities; library and recreational facilities; health and welfare centres, including <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and infant health centres; sewerage and drainage schemes; and road, street and bridge works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the arguments put forward by the employer opponents of equal pay in the 1969 equal pay case was, by implication, that equal pay should not be granted because it would jeopardise the status of the male in the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite existing New South Wales legislation, various adaptations of pyramid selling were still operating in my electorate as recently as a few months ago, when an instance was brought to my notice of despair in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, where the parents were divided over propositions put to them for pyramid selling schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want finally to mention what I think is the most important thing; that is, that the Government is as yet doing nothing effective for the young and the forming <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last two or three years the need to help the young and forming <span class="highlight">family</span> has been very much accentuated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I see every reason why, if she so chooses, a married woman who has no <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities should take outside employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I see every reason why a married woman who has <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities should not be compelled by economic exigencies to take outside work against her will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the solution to the financial distress suffered by pensioners and all low income earners, particularly those with a <span class="highlight">family</span> to support, is to make incomes on 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and below tax free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If tax relief were given at this end of the scale much would be done to relieve the pressure on the low income <span class="highlight">family</span> and others in the community to demand higher wages, which only continues the inflation spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to Professor Henderson’s survey, every fifth <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia is very poor or poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight I submit to the Special Minister of State and to the House that should the Government free the surf life saving clubs from the financial burden of meeting telephone bills it would probably be singularly the most welcome expression of gratitude the community as a whole could make, and it would cost each Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> only about lc a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behind the others there is a tremendous extended <span class="highlight">family</span> backing which makes an immense difference to the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again, the results of the Government’s emphasis on sponsored immigration and <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion are unclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to point out at this stage that it was the previous Liberal-Country Party Government which initiated the emphasis on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also like to make it quite clear that when we once again win government we will continue to support such a policy of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the expansion of the definition of what constitutes <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion has led to a remarkable increase in the number of sponsored migrants and a corresponding increase in those falling into the unskilled category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The labour is usually that of the owner and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and it, along with the little capital employed, could earn more if moved to other uses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which there is a working wife it will represent double taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> is entitled to complete repatriation health care this will entitle the remainder of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to a one-half reduction in the amount of levy to be assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are moving away from the notion of the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution to a system where all taxpayers who have certain incomes will have to pay 1.35 per cent of their taxable income for health care insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can conceive of the average taxpayer in this country - the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man with 2 children - on a conservative estimate being up for something like $100 extra, or probably more, over and above the insurance levy which he has already paid to the Government fund by way of an insurance levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will also provide the figure which represents the number of contributors, both <span class="highlight">family</span> contributors and single contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will give to the House an example of the variations in the combined hospital and medical insurance weekly contributions per <span class="highlight">family</span> as at 31 July 1974 to distinguish between the position in Queensland from that which exists in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to tell the House that under this proposal the following people will be forced to pay more for an inferior service: Single taxpayers in all but the lowest income groups, <span class="highlight">family</span> units where both the husband and wife are taxpayers, residents of that great State of Queensland, persons earning taxable income at the middle level or higher, persons requiring intermediate or private ward hospital accommodation, persons unable to obtain standard ward accommodation in public hospitals, and persons who now choose not to insure or have no need to insure for health fund benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program will develop a variety of services including the development of <span class="highlight">family</span> day care programs, day centres, pre-schools, play groups, outside of school care, emergency and occasional sitter care, toddlers groups and baby-sitting pools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members wish to know my philosophy on this matter - it relates to the expensiveness of staff, perhaps, or at least the time taken to get the staff - it is this: It is unfortunate that some of the justifiable agitation for child care centres and pre-school institutions assumes the eclipse of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian public at large is concerned about industrial disputes, about unrest which pushes up costs, which adds to inflation and which destroys the household planning of the average <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is no allowance under the proposal for a son to buy out his father and thus retain the <span class="highlight">family</span> dairy farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision should have been made in the scheme so that sons could take over the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm and retain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, we know that the socialists opposite have a deliberate policy of destroying the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm and socialising that means of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party maintains that the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm is surely the heart and pulse of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the House should be grateful for the practical wisdom of the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  and the insight of the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  who see the desirability of maintaining the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as part of the whole structure of the Australian rural economy and, indeed, of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in pursuance of section 73b (c) of the National Health Act 1953-1973, the Minister has directed that you shall cause alterations to be made to your organisation’s Queensland hospital fund rules to provide for the weekly contribution rate for -all members to the Private Table to be 63c (single) and $1.25 (<span class="highlight">family</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a husband receives this emotional shock why should we make it almost impossible for him to proceed to hold his <span class="highlight">family</span> together? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us listen to what the <span class="highlight">family</span> newspaper had to say about a speech by the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  in Murwillumbah on 15 June 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Take the position of a man with a wife and 2 children in New South Wales who wishes to cover himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> for intermediate hospital and medical cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us can talk academically about health schemes, doctors and hospitals until we or one of our <span class="highlight">family</span> need one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there will be double taxation in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Estimates of private insurance over and above the tax range from $100 to $200 a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill says, in effect, that no Australian should be placed in a position where his health or that of his <span class="highlight">family</span> can be jeopardised by his lack of money or where his health or that of his children can be further jeopardised by worry over his ability to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Labor scheme, if it had started on 1 July of this year, a <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a taxable income of $2,500- that is a man who earns only a little more than $50 a week- would have to pay a special taxation levy of 1.35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present subsidised health benefits plan- imperfect though it is- with the recent alterations, a <span class="highlight">family</span> man can earn up to $3,500 and be completely covered for hospital and medical benefits with the Government paying his contributions and he still does not have to pay any special tax levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gives the example of an average <span class="highlight">family</span>, comprising a husband, a wife who works, and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newspaper report states quite clearly that the health bill for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man will increase by 82 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very basis of the program submitted here by my Party is to make sure that the hard-working <span class="highlight">family</span> man is not plunged into poverty through his inability to afford health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the breadwinner falls ill and has no coverage, he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> can be plunged into poverty in trying to cope with doctors and hospital bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only one in the <span class="highlight">family</span> but every income earner, every taxpayer, in the <span class="highlight">family</span> will have to pay the compulsory levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance the case of a working <span class="highlight">family</span> which has to pay out an increasing amount for insurance cover; has to remember to go to the chemist regularly to pay for that cover; has to remember, if the contributor changes jobs and the boss has been making deductions from his pay, to make other arrangements to have the payments made or else when the wife has a baby in 3 months’ time or when Johnny has appendicitis there is no money; and which has to wait for repayments to arrive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> and similar families are all desperately wanting a scheme that looks after paying the bills in some civilised and easy way so that there is one more thing about which they do not have to worry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every calamity which they predicted as a result of the health scheme which we are debating this afternoon is already part and parcel of health care arrangements for which the Opposition is responsible and with which every ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> becomes involved in times of sickness or injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In local government, where at times there have been members who have not quite shown that desire to serve their community, the tendency has been to shift assets and to have them appear under other names and only investigations of the direct or indirect <span class="highlight">family</span> have shown them up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the late  Mrs Henry,  who I understand was one of the senior officers in the department in Sydney, discussed these matters at length with the senior officers of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Welfare Bureau, no means could be found whereby money could be made available for social workers to be maintained in their present positions and for this valuable organisation to be able to continue to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the economic policies of the Labor Government have been designed towards the aggregation of holdings, designed to build up the number of corporate farmers, designed to build the size of individual operations to the point where the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer himself is less and less able to retain any sort of viability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard the rhetoric about the <span class="highlight">family</span> farms and we have heard the rhetoric about the bogey of the corporations, when it was the Leader of the Country Party some years back who said about the smaller farmers that 30,000 must go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Government’s objective because the independent operator, working for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, is the greatest obstacle this Government faces in achieving its socialist objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the State member for the area,  Mr Jack  Skidmore, drew my attention to one <span class="highlight">family</span> whose carport and general area was flooded by refuse and who had to suffer the resultant stench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no more certain way to impoverish a man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> than by taking away his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when responsible <span class="highlight">family</span> managers are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet the proposed additional Government expenditure when most people are taking in their belts and starting to realise that they have to look after their jobs, the Government has announced that the reply to such a climate is ‘More of the same’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most dangerous aspects of this Government’s action towards private business, whether urban or rural, is that it is running directly opposite to the direct expressed views that it would support <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses and farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government to reconsider its position before 3 1 December and to reintroduce this assistance before further erosion occurs in the profitability of those rural industries which have as their basis the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr John  White, Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Graziers’ Association, has forecast that the capital gains tax appears to mean the end of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm in a couple of generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How ironic that a party which so viciously peddled lies about the attitude of other parties to the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm has now taken a step which is predicted to lead to the destruction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm as the basic unit of Australian agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 26 September 1974 of the Right Honourable  Sir Eric  Harrison, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Wentworth from 193 1 to 1956, and during this time a Minister of the Crown, Acting Prime Minister,  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and Resident Minister in London and then from 1956 to 1964 High Commissioner for Australia in London; and that it places on record its appreciation of his long and distinguished public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> man has been deliberately programmed to accept a reduction in his real income this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Traditionally student housing, other than <span class="highlight">family</span> housing, has been the colleges and halls of residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A man with a <span class="highlight">family</span> is obviously not able to take one or two years off to go back to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is fine for the 17 or 18-year-old who has just left school and who has no administrative and <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not satisfactory for the man who has to make his way in the world, who already has <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, who is probably already a partner in one institution or another and who must make the effort in his own time to re-educate himself to keep up with the tremendous strides in knowledge that are taking place today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that what we know and describe as beef roads could have been called defence roads, tourist roads or classified as the ordinary sort of road which permits a man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to get into their motor vehicle and drive, for instance, from Mount Isa to Brisbane, on bitumen all the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because death is deemed as a disposal, within 2 generations I believe that it will mean the end of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister himself by his own tax planning in sending his wife out to work has demonstrated quite clearly that the only lurk left is to have 2 income earners in the <span class="highlight">family</span> and to have an income division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take this course today only because I feel that an experience my own <span class="highlight">family</span> had recently is one which many thousands of Australians have previously suffered and will go on suffering until something is done about firms such as Melbourne’s quite notorious Milleradio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wanted to make reference to the capital gains tax and the serious effect it will have on <span class="highlight">family</span> farms, small businesses and the general economy in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On behalf of my <span class="highlight">family</span> and myself, I wish to convey sincerely out heartfelt thanks for the comfort given to us from both sides of the House, from the House staff and from not only the Riverina but all over Australia since the tragic loss of my eldest son. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  I assure you that my <span class="highlight">family</span> and I will never forget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would also like to express the sympathy of myself and my colleagues for the recent bereavement in his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At the outset I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  on his maiden speech this evening and also to extend my sympathy to him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> on their sad loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us express to the honourable member, to  Mrs Sullivan  and to their <span class="highlight">family</span> our profound grief in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper saw no threat to the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer, if there was adequate flexibility in the supply and availability of rural credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, this Government has acted conversely and, by tightening credit through monetary restrictions, by increasing interest rates, by lessening the amount allocated for rural reconstruction and, in this Budget, by introducing a capital gains tax, has gravely weakened the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capital gains tax is another vulture, joining the vultures of death and probate duties at the death of the <span class="highlight">family</span> fanner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of action on promises to provide means of stabilising rural incomes to counteract seasonal fluctuations places the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer at a further disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> can receive $350 a year under the isolated children scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Wannon believes that the Government cannot increase its expenditure by one-third as outlined in the Budget while expecting the average Australian to provide the things he needs for his <span class="highlight">family</span> and his home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that a young professional man from an eastern European communist country employed by his embassy in a third country recently travelled to an independent state and sought political asylum in Australia for himself, his wife and young <span class="highlight">family</span> through Australia’s representatives in that state? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of the allowance will be $10 a week and it will be paid where, because of the nature and severity of the handicap, the child requires constant care and attention in the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the few cases where a rehabilitee would be better off by remaining on his pension or benefit during training, that is a married man with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, or for other reasons would prefer to do so, provision has been made for him to elect to have his pension or benefit continued during the training period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it might give some cheap goods to some people in this country, it is giving many families great concern because their breadwinner has been put out of employment and the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is going to suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is then faced with the same possibility that his <span class="highlight">family</span> will be broken up because there is no financial means to support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are differences in earning capacities and <span class="highlight">family</span> practices, but still there is some logical basis for introducing this benefit as an interim measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has its defects, particularly by reason of the operation of the present means test which would reduce the capacity of a <span class="highlight">family</span> getting pension relief to receive additional income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a one child <span class="highlight">family</span> it is $100 a week; 2 children $110; for 3 children $120; 4 children $130; and 5 children $140. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anybody would really say that a 5 child <span class="highlight">family</span> on $140 a week is doing very well indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at this from a human point of view and remember that a man who has lost his wife should not be subject to the additional strain of having his young <span class="highlight">family</span> broken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of the difficulties that can be faced by widowers of relatively small means who are left to care for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not have <span class="highlight">family</span> income provisions, for instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the range of very significant legislation that is brought before this Parliament one sees Bills which are currently before it, such as the National Compensation Bill, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great and growing concern in the community that child care should, firstly, be made available to those people who have a real need but ought to be available also to any woman and to any <span class="highlight">family</span> wishing to have facilities for minding their children if those people wish to be employed or wish to exercise some freedom of choice in regard to working or undertaking other activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy making and the administration of child care and <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trend should be to integrate and not fragment <span class="highlight">family</span> and child care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that one of the examples which has commended itself most to me is the program being implemented by the City of Knox on a project basis- <span class="highlight">family</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the little run-about that the former Prime Minister had, a Bentley Type S- as honourable members all know that is a little <span class="highlight">family</span> run-around- was sold for $11,200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government and society has found that the problems of children who have difficulty in the fixation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> way of life are really great indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It operated under a policy which encouraged the most independent and self-sufficient Aboriginal people on the reserve to get off it, to go out and make their own way in the community outside as normal working people and as normal <span class="highlight">family</span> groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many ways single people moving to Canberra give up more than residents who come as a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will a woman whose husband continues to provide adequately for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and who is able to undertake training on her own behalf, be given the same opportunity to take advantage of the retraining scheme as for example a woman with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a husband, a wife and 2 children, on a mere $100 a week wage and whose income just keeps pace with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This tax, combined with probate duties, will have the effect of diminishing the <span class="highlight">family</span> estate within 3 successive deaths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So in addition to normal taxation commitments the industry was put in a position of having to repay gigantic sums to the Treasury and some medium sized <span class="highlight">family</span> companies, for instance, are in the position of having to find up to $ lm to meet this provision in addition to normal taxation and the huge increase in costs which have been brought about primarily by poor economic management by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past 12 months the Public Solicitor’s Office conducted over 15,000 interviews and it handled well over 500 divorce cases and other cases in connection with <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members may wish to call it <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, there may be an ex-serviceman who wishes to keep from his <span class="highlight">family</span> the nature of a particular disease from which he is suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information about his disease could reach his <span class="highlight">family</span> through the correspondence that would come from the Tribunal to him explaining the reason for the decision being taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why the Government is resisting our move because it is bad enough for a child to lose a father, it is bad enough to have the breadwinner leave the <span class="highlight">family</span>, but when the child is deprived of the mother surely the area of need is as great as or even greater than is the case in the other circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amount will be payable to the parents or guardians of a mentally or physically handicapped child cared for in a <span class="highlight">family</span> environment and requiring constant attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those of us who have had experience with such children know that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with such a child quite often desperately needs the kind of assistance that is envisaged in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Particularly, of course, there is the position of the young and forming <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was interested to hear, I think it was the honourable member for Corio, talking about <span class="highlight">family</span> endowment for the first child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the allowance which, as honourable members will be aware, is $10 a week to the parents of guardians of physically or mentally handicapped children who are cared for in the <span class="highlight">family</span> environment, will meet with wide approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somewhere along the line we will have to try to assess not only the handicap of the child- this is the starting point- but also the disability of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the alteration that a handicapped child makes to their way of life and the conduct of their household, and the effect it has not only on the mother and the father but also on the other children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be able to maintain the handicapped child at home, there also has to be the faculty for them to have a break for a holiday, of no matter how short a duration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is aware of the difficulties that can be faced by widowers of relatively small means who are left to care for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would happen in the situation in which both spouses in a <span class="highlight">family</span> are earning an income and whose combined income is less than, say, the income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> next door in which only the male head of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is earning income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it to be applied on every mother in Australia or on every <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia, which is what the Liberals are saying? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there are 40 men in an area and there are only enough projects to employ 20 of them, and if 20 of them are married with families and 20 of them are single and capable of doing work elsewhere, I believe that at a time when we need 1,400 able-bodied men in the steel industry we ought not to be using RED employment to employ single men who could get a job immediately in another industry, instead we ought to use our money to employ people who are tied to a <span class="highlight">family</span> home and who cannot go away long distances to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not agree to a proposition that would take a man long distances from his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> to obtain work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in the rate of interest has forced every <span class="highlight">family</span> buying a home to look at their budgets and to ask themselves whether they can afford to continue to pay for their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now he must ask himself whether he can afford to continue to retain that home into which he and his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> put so much effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My concern is for every <span class="highlight">family</span> in the country which is facing the prospect of rapidly rising costs of living and a high risk of increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, some conditions such as quadriplegia or a serious stroke require all the patient’s effort to adjust to the daily chores of existence alone without room for sufficient surplus energy to provide for the patient’s own support or the support of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that it is at least as socially significant as the restrictive trade practices legislation which was introduced by the Menzies Government in the 1960s; that it is at least as socially significant as the uniform divorce law or the matrimonial causes law which was introduced in 1959; that it is at least as socially significant as the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, which is now laying on the table of another place, and that it is at least as socially significant as the massive amendments to the conciliation and arbitration procedures of this country in the 1950s and the early 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do ask the Government to consider whether there ought not to be some type of option of capitalisation available to the victim of such an accident because one of the additional tragedies of a person who suffers such a permanent accident as that is that he is so often forced out of his own <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the desire of parents and relatives to care for them in a home environment and to give them some kind of emotional and personal support to alleviate much of the suffering they have, they are forced out of that <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value in those cases of lump sum awards is that it is possible for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to alter a house to make provision for the needs of the quadruplegic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only through the expenditure of a large sum of money can effective care be provided for the victim of the accident by the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that far more emphasis should be placed on making provision to assist people to care for relatives who are victims of accidents in their <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has acquired the title ‘the executioner of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm concept’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The integration of all housing policies with urban, regional and social welfare policies in such a way as to ensure that every <span class="highlight">family</span> can secure accommodation of its own choosing, appropriate to its own needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is all they are- words without action- and in the process of implementing Labor’s policies to restructure our society the first casualties have been the very people Labor claims to represent- the low to middle income earner, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man struggling to maintain a wife and children and the frail aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply not possible to buy an acceptable <span class="highlight">family</span> dwelling in any urban area today for less than $20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if a person’s weekly earnings are less than 85 per cent of the national average that person and his <span class="highlight">family</span> are eligible for a public authority- a housing trust or housing commission- home at an interest rate of  4V*  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they have a house to sell or to vacate when occupying the unit we would be providing further accommodation for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amounts to providing accommodation for a <span class="highlight">family</span> at the cost in money and resources of a home unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit that it is absolutely essential in the early days of a person’s married life to have repayments low and that these should be staggered and increased progressively later in life when <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilties are fewer and there is the fair chance that the income is higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this objective we have provided increased assistance for the child whose <span class="highlight">family</span> lives in an isolated area far removed from normal school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this year’s estimates I am pleased to note that the qualifying income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been lifted quite considerably, as has been the special supplementary allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether, when he addresses himself to this taxation question which is so close to his heart, he reflects on the fact that in a situation of scarce resources, in a situation in which he and his colleagues regularly urge the Government to reduce Government spending, every $1 devoted to a school which is already superbly housed, staffed and equipped, every $1 devoted to taxation relief for a <span class="highlight">family</span> which, as I have seen from a survey conducted recently by the Independent Schools Association in Victoria - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I applaud the honourable member for his noble outlook of trying to keep the <span class="highlight">family</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He points out that he comes from a working class <span class="highlight">family</span>, is not wealthy and that an independent school education for his children is resulting in considerable sacrifices for his <span class="highlight">family</span> in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a recent survey the gross average <span class="highlight">family</span> income of parents with children attending independent schools is between $10,000 and $12,000 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they have 2 children attending such an independent school somewhere around 40 per cent of the net <span class="highlight">family</span> income would be spent on the education of the 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much cheaper and more logical to subsidise the fees parents pay at nongovernment schools, to help to keep these fees down to a reasonable sum, thus enabling the average <span class="highlight">family</span> to send its children to one of these schools should it so choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no doubt that the caring of elderly people within their own <span class="highlight">family</span> environment is socially, and I think in the long run also economically, beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in the past 20 years there has been a move away from what is commonly called the extended <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people are able to have what are colloquially called granny flats, where it is possible for grandparents in the community to have some kind of privacy and separate life but still be under the same roof as their families and able to mix with the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in a way that is beneficial to both them and the other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not, for my part, write off completely the concept of an extended <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there has been too great a tendency to accept that a nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> is inevitable and that this is a process that cannot be reversed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole philosophy behind the provision was to give a bit of assistance and incentive to those in the community who were prepared to undertake care of the elderly in their <span class="highlight">family</span>, their close relatives, within their own home environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lump sum payments would often make it possible for those persons to be cared for in their own <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that perhaps as an interim measure the Government might give some consideration to the extension of the domiciliary allowance and the removal of the limit of 65 years or over where a person has been the victim of an accident and is being cared for in his or her own <span class="highlight">family</span> environment by close relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think in a number of Scandinavian countries some financial incentives through the taxation mechanism are given to persons who are caring for the elderly within their own <span class="highlight">family</span> environment and have had to make extensions to the home to care for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they want a day off or if the <span class="highlight">family</span> wants a picnic and cannot take the handicapped child they have to pay baby sitters and it is costing a lot of extra money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it is, a handicapped child brings enough grief to the <span class="highlight">family</span> without the added burden of very great extra expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is my belief that the means test in relation to the widows pension, where that pension is paid to a widow with dependent children, should be abolished altogether and, if it cannot be abolished altogether, at least it should be abolished in relation to the widow’s earned income so that she can, as so many widows do today, seek part-time employment in order to improve the real position of her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is general acceptance apparently in the communityit is certainly pushed by honourable members opposite- that the Government has this responsibility and duty to make up the payment, not only in cases where the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the pensioner is poor but in all cases in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that it is worth noting that if a husband and wife were both getting the full retraining allowance, a <span class="highlight">family</span> would have to have an income of $15,500 a year, taxable in normal terms, to be as well off as it is under this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister state on 13 August 1974 that de jure recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic States into the U.S.S.R. would make it easier to offer any consular assistance to members of the Baltic communities in Australia to visit their <span class="highlight">family</span> homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Association has played some part in bringing about the introduction of progressive legislation such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, which I feel rather happy about because it seeks to simplify the method of divorce and to obviate the public washing of dirty linen by marriage partners, which more or less brings about a situation in which the children of that marriage have to bear the stigma of that dirty linen being washed in public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True most of those retrenched are the second wage earners in the <span class="highlight">family</span> and even then their wages are being continued for 6 months by the Government but how few families can afford a sudden cut in income now or in 6 months and how many of the women retrenched are, in fact, supporting their families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> man with a taxable income of $150 a week will receive a similar boost to his income, for which he would otherwise have had to have an increase of 5% per cent in his wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, is he aware of the fact that his <span class="highlight">family</span> man who has been on $ 100 a week will not have a tax saving this year but will in fact pay $51.64 more in tax on the modest assumption that his income will rise by 25 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party ‘s housing policy states: … the integration of all housing policies with urban, regional and social welfare policies in such a way to ensure that every <span class="highlight">family</span> can secure accommodation of its own choosing appropriate to its own needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Minister relate that to the Government’s housing policy, which claims to ensure that every <span class="highlight">family</span> can secure accommodation of its own choosing that is appropriate to its own needs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To relate the needs test to 95 per cent of average weekly earnings of the main income earner of a <span class="highlight">family</span> forgets that the criterion for determining need used by the Henderson Commission and by every other inquiry into poverty or relative affluence in a community is a <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, does the Government suggest that in a time of rising unemployment a <span class="highlight">family</span> which hitherto had 2 income earners and which now has only one income earner who receives say 85 per cent of average earnings and whose wife is unemployed, is not in a different position and that for all practical purposes the needs test applying to this <span class="highlight">family</span> has not altered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>This would be the level of a needs test for a <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a man, his wife and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are we to say that if a <span class="highlight">family</span> has 6 children and the needs test moves up to $ 108 a week that <span class="highlight">family</span> is in exactly the same position as a <span class="highlight">family</span> on $100 a week with 2 children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>People who try to impose a needs test like this make a very grave error and do not comprehend the essential measure of poverty which has to be available and disposable <span class="highlight">family</span> income, according to circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It still seems that Hargreave’s Law applies with respect to the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation and it still seems that families with more than the average number of children tend to be poorer families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to consider seriously the details of the needs test which he requires, the relation of that needs test in terms of growing unemployment in Australia and the essential criteria for determining the position of a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wage increases have gone well beyond the increase in productivity and have only resulted in rapidly increasing inflation, which in its turn is putting the price of a home beyond the reach of the <span class="highlight">family</span> on the average income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all, in the <span class="highlight">family</span> context it enables them to be a good parent and to give their children a better environment in which to grow up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> that is cooped up in a small flat, with no play area for the children and no way in which the parents can have some privacy from the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, breeds a dangerous condition of frustration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who are at present opposing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill could well put some of their energy into looking into the housing problem because fewer marriages would be in danger of breaking down if more people had homes, if more people had room to move in their homes and if more people could rent a home at a price they could afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the sad things about the 20th century is the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> and the decline of the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> unit which has left the field of caring for the aged largely in the hands of voluntary organisations or the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take your point,  Mr Speaker,  but surely the emphasis has to be given because the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill touches directly on the issue that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition and dealt with in a follow-up way by the honourable member for Hotham: It deals with children; it deals with custody; it deals with maintenance; it deals wirh access and other matters of that sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn to another clause wherein we see the monumental insincerity of the Government in relation to companies, because it has presided over the rape of the <span class="highlight">family</span> company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So do not tell me that the present Government is not committed to the destruction of private or <span class="highlight">family</span> companies and do not tell me that it is concerned about the productivity they attain or the employment they provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the way in which the Treasurer’s own summary sets out the situation: Firstly, a confidence trick has been played in relation to the so-called cuts in income tax which return a minute portion of the inflationary bonanza; secondly, a disastrous super tax has been imposed on income from property- the demise of all incentive to productivity, to the management of our unemployment problem which is the sort of disastrous policy that directly contributes to unemployment; thirdly, a further reduction in the age rebate; and, fourthly, the rape of <span class="highlight">family</span> companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst we support the increases provided in the Budget for education, we believe that the decision to reduce the deduction does not take into account that the benefit was available in respect of expenses incurred by the <span class="highlight">family</span> for the individual child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> business and the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm will be destroyed under such taxes as these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their responsibilities in terms of their day-to-day care of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and of the home and their attitudes to a standard of life style certainly do not, or should not, place them in the category in which they should be regarded as being able to carry the load. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, a great deal of consideration needs to be given to this in an effective way, if we are to save the viability of country properties and if we are to protect those who are beneficiaries within the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle and who deserve to be protected from bankruptcy, which will be inescapable unless effective action is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This of course involves also an examination of the equity of the tax system insofar as it affects not only a taxpayer but also a tax paying <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I reject out of hand the suggestion that there should be an aggregation of <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes and the imposition of taxation on the aggregate income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I urge that consideration be given to taxation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes upon the basis of a notional partnership between husband and wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man who is earning, say, $ 10,000 a year should not be as grossly disadvantaged as he is today when his <span class="highlight">family</span> is compared with a <span class="highlight">family</span> earning 2 incomes- say $6,000 a year by one person and $4,000 by the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many such families where the contribution in time at work taken on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis is not different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The male breadwinner can have the same sort of job in each <span class="highlight">family</span>, but one man may take all the overtime he can get and may be away from his <span class="highlight">family</span> for several additional hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the families could be in like circumstances yet the tax burden borne by those 2 families could vary significantly, to the extent that one <span class="highlight">family</span> would be discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague says, it is a scheme of penalties which imposes a harsh burden on the <span class="highlight">family</span> which has a strong desire that the mother should stay home to look after young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put to him the example of a <span class="highlight">family</span> comprised of a man, his wife and perhaps 2 children which has a net income of $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government say to that <span class="highlight">family</span>: ‘We are very generous with our taxation deductibility scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is the problem of aggregating <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, will the Treasurer explain why it is that, for example, person A, who is buying a home which is an appreciating asset, can take home more pay than person B, who is paying rent, and who is disadvantaged all the way down the line, although both men perform the same amount and son of work, receive the same salary and have the same sized <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be hoped that this amount will obviate the situation in which the answer to falling patronage is to curtail services further and thus force people into a second <span class="highlight">family</span> car category for purposes of convenience alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to assist eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and women and, in one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> situations, their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all feel a lot of pride in our <span class="highlight">family</span>’s achievements, and there is nothing different in the pride of parents of handicapped children, be they physically or mentally handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also gives relief to the parents and the other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> for at least part of the day while these people are away and being cared for by professional and well meaning people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Specific documented cases can be produced by local general practitioners, church organisations, community welfare groups, the Royal District Nursing Service and the East Bentleigh police concerning emotional difficulties, suicide, chronic illness, psychiatric disorders, mental retardation, alcoholism, drug abuse, marital disruption, one-parent families, physical handicap, school drop-outs, juvenile delinquency, preventable criminal behaviour and multiple psycho-social economic and <span class="highlight">family</span> problems associated with many common physical ailments, whose needs are not being met by the existing general practitioner service or by the public or voluntary community agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will get 6 doctors on a feeforservice basis and they will share the functions of <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling, emergency treatment, immunisation and infant welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Patients who require certain services such as psychiatric services and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning are stigmatised when they are forced to attend a separate facility from that which serves other members of the local community with other forms of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the proposition that it can be run by a single <span class="highlight">family</span> or not run by a single <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we address ourselves to this problem along those lines we realise that increasingly the capitalisation required to give a <span class="highlight">family</span> a satisfactory income will become larger and larger as the years go by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are faced with is the reality in this industry, as in many other agricultural industries, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm unit is big business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with a pretty large enterprise, not that it gives occupations to a lot of people but simply that a large enterprise is needed to provide a sensible standard of living for a single <span class="highlight">family</span> operating that enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need to preserve <span class="highlight">family</span> units in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sociological justification that we present for this concern about <span class="highlight">family</span> units rather than a purely economic one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to replace the existing divorce law contained in the Matrimonial Causes Act with up-to-date provisions, to make uniform provision in areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law outside divorce that are at present the subject of State and Territory law, and to provide for the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to administer this jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions to cover other areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and to establish <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to administer the law flowed from this original purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was first introduced into the Senate almost a year ago, on 13 December 1 973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its introduction was preceded by a detailed consideration of the law and administration of divorce, custody and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, to which the topic was referred for consideration as long ago as December 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report contained some recommendations for amendment, notably the establishment of a separate <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which have largely been incorporated in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it was the experience and expertise in the areas of social welfare and <span class="highlight">family</span> law possessed by the persons - and bodies that have expressed support for the proposed ground of divorce, as well as the strength of their numbers, that convinced the Attorney-General of the desirability of this reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there has been apprehension about the possible effects of such a substantial change in an area that affects us all, namely the <span class="highlight">family</span>, is understandable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings me to the other most significant provision of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, the establishment of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts is that they will be helping courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These courts will therefore be very different from the courts that presently exercise <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Judges appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, which is established by the Bill, are required to be ‘suitable to deal with matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law by reason of training, experience and personality’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the creation of a new Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the Bill also provides the opportunity for the States to establish their own <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only State that has so far established a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to agreement with the States, the Australian Government will finance the establishment and administration of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The counselling and welfare facilities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court would be available to State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts thus created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia will be a court of appeal for any State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court that is set up, and it will exercise original jurisdiction in the Territories and in the States in association with the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is set up in a State or part of a State, jurisdiction under the Bill will continue to be exercised by the State Supreme Court and by courts of summary jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He or she will merely file a notice in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which will bring in the director of counselling and welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to turn now to the provisions of the Bill concerning the welfare and custody of children who, as I said before, are the real victims in <span class="highlight">family</span> disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disputes over custody of children are undoubtedly the saddest of all <span class="highlight">family</span> disputes, and it is hoped that this provision will induce parents to get together and agree on custody arrangements in more cases than they do now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall make only passing mention of the more technical matters that are traditionally associated with the exercise of jurisdiction in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I should like to make special mention of 2 provisions that have been inserted in the Bill to create a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former body is to consist of a judge of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court, and such other judges, officers of the Australian and State Public Services, representatives of counselling organisations and other persons as are appointed by the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council will make recommendations to the Attorney-General concerning the working of the Bill, <span class="highlight">family</span> law generally and the working of legal aid in <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings, and will furnish an annual report for tabling in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies is to conduct research into factors affecting marital and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia, with the object of promoting and protecting the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Environmental aspects of Service life including pay, benefits, working conditions, housing, effects of military life upon <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships, leave, superannuation, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society, especially Hindu society, has been based for thousands of years on the premise that sons are not only gifts from heaven but also the economic basis upon which a <span class="highlight">family</span> can exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is simply not sufficient to say to a mother that she must therefore practise birth control merely to limit her <span class="highlight">family</span>, as this concept at this stage of their development means so little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include not only the men one sees in the disused Army greatcoats lounging around parks and gardens or in the depressed areas of the city, but also the young homosexual who is cast out by his <span class="highlight">family</span> because they do not understand that some people are sexually deviant without any blame cast upon themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the discarded daughter of a <span class="highlight">family</span> who will not meet the strict moral requirements of that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to assist the eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and women and, in one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> situations, their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few people could disagree with the statements of the Minister in his second reading speech when he refers to the virtues of legislation of this type, as distinct from this Bill, and its clauses, and one could be very much inclined to accept the view that to speak about the environment and environmental consequences when we are looking at important developments, is almost the same as speaking 10 years ago about the virtues of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are the same sort of values that I regard as important when I think about the <span class="highlight">family</span> and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fundamentally, I am worried about the opportunities of those many Australians who have played such a tremendous role in developing this country- the small individual <span class="highlight">family</span> farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been traditional in Australia that a young mother having a baby has her <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor consult her during her confinement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another proposition to have it all in one giant computer brain: How many times you have been to a psychiatrist, how many times somebody in the <span class="highlight">family</span> has had an abortion, how many times a venereal disease or some other social stigma has been attached to somebody in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, all available from one computer bank by the pressing of a button. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are: Greater share of cost sharing for pensioner medical bed days- pensioners are an accepted Commonwealth reponsibility and it is right that we should not be loading the States at great cost to themselves with the cost of pensioners who are hospital patients; an improved subsidised health benefits scheme which would provide an automatic form of cover for low income people plus a greater degree of flexibility for <span class="highlight">family</span> size; medical cover for outpatients; discussions on psychiatric patients and ambulance costs, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ordinary working <span class="highlight">family</span> will be taxed twice if both husband and wife work; so the average <span class="highlight">family</span> with both husband and wife working will also be harmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that on matters such as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, where there is a conscience vote and such marked division within the Labor Party, there will be adequate time for debate but I wish to goodness that the precedent the Leader of the House is setting on the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill were to be followed in other matters of significance where those of us on this side of the House, representing as we do half the Australian electorate at least and I believe a good deal more than half at present, would be given an opportunity- not just the principal spokesman in our Parties but those who are on the back bench representing their electorates- to get up and canvass the views and matters which their constituents wish them to canvass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to thank voluntary aid organisations such as Red Cross, St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, the Smith <span class="highlight">Family</span> and the Australian Council of Social Service, which collected needed goods and arranged their despatching, cared for evacuees and are still caring for them; government personnel in every area of endeavour from social workers to government carpenters, from PMG telephonists to information officers, from hotel administrators to drivers; the medical and nursing profession who in the cities and towns to which evacuated people were brought worked unceasingly, as did their colleagues who went to Darwin, enhancing their already high reputation; the police forces who strove successfully to co-ordinate the movements of evacuees and in particular those members of the police forces who went to Darwin where they undertook hazardous tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is one of the most discriminatory, ill-considered and badly drafted Bills ever to be introduced into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many leaders in the community from the professions, among social workers and in the churches have pointed to the changes which will be introduced into the nature of marriage and threaten the stability of the <span class="highlight">family</span> if this Bill is passed without amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill deals broadly with 3 aspects: The dissolution of the marriage tie; the resolution of ancillary matters between the parties either before or after the dissolution of the marriage; and the creation of a Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions are deceitful in their glib disguise of a fundamental change of the philosophy of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill turns marriage into a cheap, temporary union which may be dissolved on the unilateral decision of one party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How ludicrous it is to have such a procedure as that contemplated by clause 15 (1), where a party to a marriage can file in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court a notice stating that he or she intends to seek the assistance of the counselling facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part IV of the Bill deals with the formation and constitution of a Federal court to be known as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be impossible for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to get around vast areas of the Australian countryside on circuit as the State Supreme Court judges do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will suffer the psychological damage of <span class="highlight">family</span> collapse, the loss of security, torn affections and both emotional and material disturbance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indirectly, the community suffers as a <span class="highlight">family</span> collapse contributes to an erosion of those values which buttress marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Financially, the community is obliged to bear a substantial portion of the direct costs of <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are: Firstly, the maintenance of those parties and their children unable to support themselves without social security assistance; secondly, the administrative costs associated with increased demands upon either the existing legal system or the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia; thirdly, the increased demands upon the Australian Legal Aid Office, as is provided for in clause 117(3) and (4); fourthly, the probable increased demand for child care centres; and, fifthly, the increased demand for services to deal with the psychological and physical ill-health of disadvantaged one-parent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under clause 43 the judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are directed to have regard to a number of principles in exercising their jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of the Australian society; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill deals primarily with divorce and other aspects of <span class="highlight">family</span> law which impinge upon divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It establishes a <span class="highlight">family</span> law council which is to advise the Attorney-General on the workings of the Act and by that means and by general public comment the Act may well be extended over the years to cover other aspects of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that legislators and their constituents ought to consider the relationship of the state and the <span class="highlight">family</span> most carefully when contemplating legislation which affects the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From Herodotus, the first historian, to current historians and anthropologists much has been said regarding the great diversity in the size and the structure of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and of the laws which govern the conduct within and without the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of these diversities, however, mankind has always placed enormous emphasis upon the <span class="highlight">family</span>, however formed or governed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has been the basis of other social groupings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aristotle believed that the originaal intention of the <span class="highlight">family</span> was to supply man’s everyday needs whereas the state had a broader and less intimate role in establishing beneficial conditions within which the <span class="highlight">family</span> could function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> unit produced stability for the overall society and the state helped to create circumstances in which families could prosper and be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State interference with the <span class="highlight">family</span> was, however, of a very limited nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we must ensure that the law governing the <span class="highlight">family</span> enables its members to cope with their responsibilities to each other without the imposition by the state of a rigid set of moral imperatives which may be acceptable to many <span class="highlight">family</span> members but which may be unacceptable in varying degrees to a great many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In laws governing families as single units the historic principle should be maintained and the state should interfere as little as possible with the freedom of action and responsibility within the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This principle has so far prevailed throughout Western society even though the <span class="highlight">family</span> has gradually transferred some of its responsibilities to the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industrialisation has diminished the economic significance to the state of both agriculture and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, many of the social responsibilities of the <span class="highlight">family</span> remain, particularly the rearing of children, although even here educational and other state responsibilities impinge upon the role of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that the <span class="highlight">family</span> law council, the <span class="highlight">family</span> law court and social institutions will accelerate this movement towards complete equality of opportunity and responsibility between the sexes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the church was more dominant than it is today and was engaged in its own battles with the state it refused to allow the state to interfere with the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>St Thomas Aquinas and other theologians believed that the <span class="highlight">family</span> was more directly of divine origin than was the state and that the state would be exceeding its authority to interfere with the relationships between spouses and between parents and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, however, is a matter for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and not the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have endeavoured to trace the history of <span class="highlight">family</span>-state relationships and the past record of legislation of this type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the tradition of minimal interference in the lives of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Parliament has a public interest responsibility which takes 2 forms- that regarding the institution of marriage itself, an institution which is still most respected in our community, and that concerning the individual lives of the parties to the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other matters relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, such as those set out in the Liberal Party’s platform, must await later action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been claimed by the supporters of this legislation that it will help buttress marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation has been named by the Government as the ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of this Bill could be to transform and destroy the Christian values upon which our <span class="highlight">family</span> life has been based in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the accepted Christian principles of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are eroded the end result must eventually be a lack of respect for the traditions of marriage with the resultant growth of fragmented and broken families and a consequent lack of parental control and a possible increase in anti-social behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Couple this Bill with the abortion on demand Bill which was introduced in the previous Parliament by 2 members of the Labor Party, the honourable member for Diamond Valley,  Mr McKenzie,  and the honourable member for La Trobe,  Mr Lamb,  a Bill which was voted for by a vast majority, although certainly not all, of the members of the Labor Party and we see emerging a pattern which makes one wonder what future Christian <span class="highlight">family</span> life as we know it today has under a Labor socialist government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister introduced this legislation into the House he said that its purpose was to ‘reform the law of divorce and to provide for the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It alters completely the system which most of us have grown to accept- that the husband is essentially the main wage earner and the wife’s role is that of bringing up the <span class="highlight">family</span>, particularly in the early years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It calls for a woman to pay her own costs, and a mother with a young <span class="highlight">family</span> who has chosen to stay at home and care for the children will be liable to pay for costs of proceedings which may not have been initiated by herself and which she may not be able to afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general majority of women cannot command an income capable of supporting a <span class="highlight">family</span>, give them adequate housing and security, and then in addition face long hours of domestic work and supporting activities with their children out of school hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women play a special role in marriage and special provision must be made by legislators to assist them to perform that function, not only for their own fulfilment but also for the good of their <span class="highlight">family</span> and society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is she suddenly to be told, after all those years of loyalty in raising her <span class="highlight">family</span>, that she can now go out to work and fend for herself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand the great concern about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We surely must all be aware of the squalid aspects which surround our present system; the excessive legalisms and costs; the considerable perjury in the courts; the provision of even greater opportunities in the present procedures for bitterness, acrimony and even hatred between <span class="highlight">family</span> members which brings out the worst in people and lasts for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very foundation of Australian society has been based on the existence of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia generally accept the policy that a husband supports his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>, but the proposed Bill indicates a change of direction- in effect it goes off at a tangent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After years of dedication and application rearing and caring for a <span class="highlight">family</span>, with her early training now either forgotten, or time having passed her by, and working for years often with little or no pay, she will have to go to the court to argue her position and establish her need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is another comment I should like to make regarding the formation of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following some recent public comment regarding the appointment of a certain judge, it would appear to me to be an eminently suitable argument to advance that the judges of the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts should be appointed subject to the approval of the various State Attorneys-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that although the Commonwealth is supplying the finance for the establishment and administration of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts the States will be in control of their own affairs, lt is to be regretted that these <span class="highlight">family</span> courts will be located in large and metropolitan areas to which people will have to go in order to obtain a divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill states that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental unit of society seems to me nothing more than a truism, and it is therefore necessary to examine what this sentence is supposed to convey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consent as the basis of marriage applies even when marriage is under stress, that is, when the partners decide that the benefits of retaining their <span class="highlight">family</span> as one unit outweigh the benefits of <span class="highlight">family</span> breakup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the provision for counselling and the provision of facilities for counselling services attached to the <span class="highlight">family</span> court, there is provision for assistance for voluntary marriage counselling organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, less formal perhaps than the present courts, are still too formal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a <span class="highlight">family</span> court whose decisions would not be without appeal against the respondent, a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in which no lawyers appeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the initial <span class="highlight">family</span> court the appearance of a lawyer is itself an offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a <span class="highlight">family</span> court where there was the maximum of informality and the maximum chance of reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contemporary crisis in <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships results from a large variety of factors including changes in the social philosophy which are emphasising increasingly the freedom of the individual to develop his own philosophy of life and the freedom of the individual to acquire the tools for an analysis of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A stress is being introduced into <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships which was not a feature of society in which education did not achieve the same position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change in the economic status of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the modern urban society is also creating increasing stresses on relationships within marriage and without and this again is an area in which we need to adjust our approach to and our thinking on that marriage relationship- the fundamental cornerstone of families in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new found freedom of women- a freedom which allows them to develop their God-given intellect and talents in a way they have never been able to develop them beforemeans that we have to look very seriously at the whole structural relationships of our society, particularly the <span class="highlight">family</span> structural relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are confronted with a dilemma in human relationships which needs understanding and sympathy but all it attracts from the community outside is harsh judgement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The community- I am being interrupted by members of the Australian Country Party who cannot keep quiet even in a serious debate such as this- in 1985 will be even more in need of the types of reforms this Bill embodies, and even more in need of a sensitive examination of the relationships between people and in particular between individuals in a <span class="highlight">family</span> bearing in mind the technical changes that will have taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is common agreement across society that any law affecting marriage, divorce and the <span class="highlight">family</span> should meet 2 fundamental standards: Firstly, it should strengthen, rather than weaken, the stability, integrity, and happiness of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life; and, secondly, where the misfortune of dissolution of marriage does occur, the law and its administration should ensure that divorce proceeds with justice to all parties, and with safeguards to the dignity and due privacy of all concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the separation of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court matters from those courts which necessarily deal with criminal offences; the provision for divorce proceedings to be conducted in closed court; the emphasis on the paramountcy of the child’s welfare in custody proceedings; the attempts to improve counselling and reconciliation faculties; the proposals for a continuing study of matters affecting <span class="highlight">family</span> stability, the working of divorce law and legal aid- provided, of course, this study is conducted in a genuinely representative way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the British Act does not make divorce as easily accessible as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will educate people into a concept of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities that will be destructive to <span class="highlight">family</span> life and may impose grave injustices on innocent parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that on this relationship the very stability of <span class="highlight">family</span> life rests and most particularly does the welfare of the children rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill would radically change these fundamental relationships between husband and wife on which the cohesion and stability of <span class="highlight">family</span> life rests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But during, say, 10 years spent in carrying out her responsibilities of raising and caring for a <span class="highlight">family</span> she has lost touch with the pre-marriage work in which she was employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There, in addition to the problems imposed on her by what she has suffered from her husband, she has now to bear the added burden of proving her need for maintence and paying her costs in endeavouring to do so.. She, the innocent party, who accepted her responsibilities to the marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>, is to be further penalised by this legislation while the husband, whose misconduct has caused the harm and the break, is to be exonerated by the law from responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will all this do to marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life in general? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do so would be to grant the law’s blessing on the guilty and the irresponsible, to impose harsh and unjust burdens on the innocent, and, ultimately, to undermine the stability and integrity of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These principles must be incorporated as the essence of this legislation if Australia is to have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which generally and genuinely buttresses the institution of marriage and protects the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand I am not completely convinced that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill of 1 974 does not already spell that out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have 2 areas of concern, namely, the future of children and the maintenance of the wife of a broken <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point has been made already today that a child or children living in an unhappy house- I use the word house’ carefully,” I do not use the word ‘home’can be tormented to a far greater degree than a child or children who live in a one-parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all honourable members in this chamber were honest, we would admit that we know many cases in which children have lived in circumstances such as I have described and their <span class="highlight">family</span> life has been most unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that clause 75, contrary to many of the arguments put forward or the furphies spread in this place, sets out on a needs basis to provide for a woman and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the views expressed by some people, I do not believe that if the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a married couple has grown up and only the husband and wife remain living together, and that couple then separates and is divorced and the wife is well provided for the husband should, for the rest of his life, be required to pay the penalty for having married that woman in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-With due respect to the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  I rise to express in this debate not only a personal viewpoint but also the concern shown about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill by the people of my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak for my <span class="highlight">family</span>, for all families, for those people who are the very basis of this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received on my desk a submission entitled The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- Its Laws and Principles’ from a  Mr Ray  Watson, Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I wish to make at the outset is that the backbone or the heart of this country is still the <span class="highlight">family</span>- is still the father, mother and children who work hard at looking after each other- and is still that despite the everincreasing pressures being placed upon the <span class="highlight">family</span> from every possible direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will weaken the marriage contract, which in turn will lead to a weakening of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a basic unit of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are other considerations, such as what a <span class="highlight">family</span> means and what <span class="highlight">family</span> life means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third section of the form requires that a taxpayer disclose to his employer details of income from investment, <span class="highlight">family</span> estates and money gained from outside employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the growth of financial institutions catering largely for the middle income earners, there has never been a Government policy directed at the housing needs of that energetic and deserving section of the Australian people- those above the level of direct need, but who yet require a marshalling of the resources of the community if they are to attain the high quality home which should be the heritage of every <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have some idea how to do this, but I also make an appeal to private enterprise to come forward with plans in this field which can be the subject of joint enterprise, where government money is allied with moderate profitseeking in the provision of high quality <span class="highlight">family</span> homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We already have the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">family</span> of banks, of whose work in housing we are justifiably proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, so far as it can within its resources, the Corporation will make housing loans available to families, using the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance provisions in the Austraiian Constitution, and it will also make loans to those other specific categories of home-seekers for whom the Australian Government has a constitutional responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one pulls on the Bonython <span class="highlight">family</span> in Adelaide one runs into a fanbit of trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the back is a photo of a certain gentleman with his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>, a former member of this chamber, the honourable A. J. Grassby, who is now an appointed officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not employ his <span class="highlight">family</span>, so why should we get cheap - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of carrying the amendment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill would be that the question for the second reading of the BUI would not be carried, but this would not necessarily prevent further progress of the Bill which I would assume would be a matter for Government consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The business before the Chair is the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gets rid of the legalism because it establishes <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there to be a more civilised and more rational approach through <span class="highlight">family</span> courts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major things which for practical purposes will be stopped under this Bill, if the amendment is carried, is the great advance that that has been written into the Bill to reduce this rigidity and legalism by substituting <span class="highlight">family</span> court procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question to be asked in respect of this Bill- it is so obvious that it cannot be ignored- is: What is its conception of the <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill concerns the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Watson  and another architect of the Bill,  Mr Turner,  at the  Sir Thomas  More Society meeting in Sydney in late November 1974 were asked: ‘What does the Bill do with respect to the <span class="highlight">family</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I was a little puzzled when the same gentleman, speaking on the radio program ‘PM’ the night before last, which in time is closer to the debate taking place on this Bill and when its contents are perused a little more closely, had this to say when asked what conception of <span class="highlight">family</span> there was in the Bill: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There ‘s no philosophic change in the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> which I would see as one of the building bricks of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the introduction of closed courts is a good move forward in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does, it is to be hoped that complementary State legislation will be passed to enable the objective to be achieved satisfactorily and within a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar considerations apply to jurisdiction over <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason why the whole jurisdiction within a State should not be exercised by <span class="highlight">family</span> courts controlled and established by State law and assisted by Federal money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, however, does provide for the appointment of Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court judges, six in all and more if prescribed by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be possible for constitutional reasons to appoint to the Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court the type of judge regarded as ideal for State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts by section 41 of the Bill, namely, those who cannot hold office beyond the age of sixty-five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the States, until the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts are set up, the jurisdiction can be exercised by State judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be divisive, inefficient, confusing to the public and a waste of public funds to set up a Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court with all the trappings of courts and court officers alongside a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court in the same city, established in accordance with section 41 of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that the Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court judges will exercise appellate jurisdiction from State and Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there may be isolated instances of diversity between them in construing the present Act over 15 years, no case is made out which justifies the setting up of a special itinerant court at public expense to deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> court appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that the Government will not proceed to appoint judges to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia but will instead get on with the task of establishing State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts under section 4 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would also give respect to the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to which clause 43 refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is thus proposing- I think the present Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  was very clear about this and what I say is not an attack on the Bill- an alternative philosophical basis of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> while professing not to do so, because the theological part in clause 43 is a profession not to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is to be Federal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts have not been fully thought out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  who preceded me in this debate and who pleaded not to establish the federal courts because of certain disabilities they had but to vest State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts with federal jurisdiction made points which every lawyer whom I have questioned upon the clause agrees are true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A spokesman for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court Registrar said this week:  ‘Mr Justice  Waddell and  Mr Justice  Yeldham each will hear about 200 divorce petitions a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another 100 undefended petitions a week would be disposed of by other judges sitting in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government’s <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill looks like taking some time to get through Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly may I draw attention to the fact that some of my amendments are directed to reducing the intervention of lawyers into the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to be set up under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statutes which are enacted here on matters of hire purchase, company law, criminal law, custody law and <span class="highlight">family</span> law, if the Bill goes through in its present form, are legislative trends miles apart in many ways from the legislative trends in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This compares with the current charges of over $3 per week for the lowest <span class="highlight">family</span> rate of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd or the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia in New South Wales and about $4 per week for private hospital cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government does not plan initially to regionalise operations- at least I have not heard of those plans- and to place people in areas so that basically they will get on to a particular doctor’s list and be able to go only to that doctor, there is no question but that ultimately the freedom of choice of <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one has subsidised a member of one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> who is a non-pensioner in a nursing home one will know exactly what this will mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- I desire to inform the House that it is proposed that the House sit on Friday week, 28 February 1975, at 9.30 a.m. for the sole purpose of debating the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can remember my predecessor for Kennedy the late Bill Riordan, a man who served this Parliament for 30 years and a member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> that attracted nothing but a grand reputation for integrity and service to this nation, warning us as members of the Cloncurry branch of the Australian Labor Party that there were certain pressures coming into the Party which were going to fragment and destroy the substance of the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to get down to personalities, but the Prime Minister of this country had the great advantage of having been born into a fine <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another initiative has been to fund the <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine plan which is a program of training administered, planned, designed and carried on by the College of General Practitioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Mr Hynam  ‘s case, we have expressed our concern that his immense personal and <span class="highlight">family</span> gains from investments in Poseidon, and his close association with that company’s geologists and with  Mr Shierlaw,  may have led him to subordinate his official obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tenant with an assessed <span class="highlight">family</span> income of $37.50 per week would, on this scale, pay a rental of $7.00 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Like those opposing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, they want it withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present limitation reacts harshly on the young ratepayer who in all probability is struggling to secure a home for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They start as a couple, have a <span class="highlight">family</span> and then gradually withdraw to the position again of one or two people living in the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to have the aim of providing one house for every Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> it has to be a public undertaking over which the Government has significant control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that often the direction in which a student might be going might be quite different from the pattern and life style of his own home and his own <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may mean in the interests of his education and development that he moves out of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and finds his own accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government dedicated to avowed centralism could argue that housing could be provided to anyone as a form of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the result of this interpretation of section 51 (xxiiiA.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that what is really meant is that the operation is limited to some cash benefit associated with, and part of, <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth in the area of housing has to rely upon the provision of housing being incidental to its power to make laws with respect to: <span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances; the Aboriginal people of Australia; immigrants, and Commonwealth employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, by the use of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance provisions in the Australian Constitution, the Australian Government can provide financial assistance to families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When voting on this Bill honourable members should remember that there is no other single problem in life today which threatens the <span class="highlight">family</span> as much as inadequate housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am attracted to the proposition that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances power in the constitution will be utilised in order to help certain families and certain classes of families who presently are not eligilbe to obtain the finance that is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am excepting, in that respect, the use of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Young couples who have commenced their <span class="highlight">family</span> very early in life and are finding it difficult to provide money immediately would get great benefit from such a scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is of particular relevance as this House is at present considering another Bill which deals with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of maternity allowances, widows’ pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is under this <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance part of section 5 1 of the Constitution that it is proposed to provide assistance to the people about whom I have been talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under present arrangements to be eligible for a loan of Home Builders’ Account moneys, the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, exclusive of overtime and child endowment payments, during the 6 months immediately prior to applying for a loan must not have exceeded 95 per cent of the Commonwealth Statistician’s estimate of average weekly earnings during the preceding December quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, insofar as Home Builders’ Account applicants are concerned, this variation in the method of computing the needs tests will have the effect of raising the limit at the present time for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with up to 2 children from $117.80 to $136.80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Housing Corporation could lend to a <span class="highlight">family</span> in this situation at a subsidised rate of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be endorsed as it has been by the Opposition What we question and with very good reason is whether this piece of legislation as formulated and as presented to this House is going to be capable of doing that or is it in fact simply going to be another means of separating the ordinary man and his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> from their dream, which is to be able to live in a decent house and preferably to be able to purchase that house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further benefit to home owners is the exemption of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home from death duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is of no benefit if one has no <span class="highlight">family</span> home of one’s own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by way of, or as incidental to, the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the philosophy of the Liberal Party we have always sought an underpinning of the widest distribution of wealth through an instrument of private ownership such as the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the House, unless otherwise ordered, giving precedence over all other business for that day to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak briefly on this matter to outline to honourable members that the purpose of this extra sitting day is to give those honourable members who are still to speak in the debate on the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and the amendment moved thereto the time to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gave some forewarning of the possible need for additional days for such matters as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill when the days and hours of sitting were debated earlier in this session and also when I made a brief statement on this matter last Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion provides for the House to meet tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. and to deal solely with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently tomorrow precedence is to be given to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those double dissolution measures have been given priority above the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result we have to have a special day of sitting to consider the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition are concerned about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House, while seeking an adequate debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, equally seek an adequate opportunity to debate all other matters of major legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that then, and only then, can the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>‘The <span class="highlight">family</span> negotiates and no solicitor is required’, is the usual spiel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These terms would have regard to the <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances as well as the income of the borrower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill as passed by the Senate contains major changes to the law relating to divorce and I believe would be more appropriately designated as the divorce law bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who claim to have a wide experience in divorce proceedings, and I know they do have a wide experience, have completely differing views on the effect of this Bill on <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend that to preserve <span class="highlight">family</span> life as the basic unit of society the marriage contract must not be treated as lightly as is proposed in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental factor, however, in the consideraton of such a Bill as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is how to preserve marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first principle which the Minister wants the Bill to include is that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is a natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Human Rights Bill, which is to be considered by the Parliament as government legislation,  explicitly recognises the right io many  and found a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and protects the <span class="highlight">family</span> against unlawful or arbitrary interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill now before us, does no more than seek to carry out our obligations under the United Nations Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision anywhere in this Bill, however it is construed, which would force a working class wife, with children under 18 years of age, to work in order to support herself or to live solely on the pension, provided her spouse is employed and earns sufficient income to enable him to contribute to the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am terribly fearful that if amendments that might be part of a scheme of amendments to improve the Bill are adopted in part we will end up with a hotch-potch of a Bill that will be quite unsatisfactory for the purposes for which we require a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These tests are very difficult because one’s understanding of the nature of a <span class="highlight">family</span> varies with each <span class="highlight">family</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support strongly the formation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law council to advise on amendments to the law and to operate on a continuing basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support strongly the establishment of an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, provided that it operates in a way which promotes a real study of how the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit may be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to that Institute, I particularly note the views of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Life Movement of Australia which wrote to me and indicated very strongly the need for pre-marital education at various levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies will closely examine this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Life Movement made detailed recommendations on the importance of pre-marital education at various levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’s single ground for dissolution- the irretrievable breakdown of marriage- the present Act lists 14 grounds for the dissolution of marriage, of which eleven are based upon fault or some element of fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Welfare and counselling services are attached to the <span class="highlight">family</span> court created by the legislation under debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the supporters of this Bill have often failed to point out is that most of these happy remarriages have occurred under the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act, which this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is not trying to amend but is trying to slash to pieces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the <span class="highlight">family</span>- the duties of a husband and wife to each other, their children and also their property rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It alters the meaning of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>- a meaning that has been formulated by the vast majority of Australians out of a long line of <span class="highlight">family</span> associations, <span class="highlight">family</span> example and <span class="highlight">family</span> instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate proved it was well aware of this universal love and respect for marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>, because it inserted a clause defining marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> that endorses and supports the statements I have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 43 indicates that this meaning of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the foundation of our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in those clauses that the Bill changes the meaning of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> from a position where marriage can be dissolved only after valid, objective tests of irretrievable breakdown are applied by the court to a position in which it is mandatory on the court to dissolve a marriage if one of the marriage partners who is an applicant for divorce and who has been of sound mind says in evidence that neither of the parties wishes the marriage to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that may be so, I do not think it should give anyone the mandate to tear up the traditional meaning and importance of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">family</span> a child learns at an early age to relate to other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take away the stability of <span class="highlight">family</span> life in early childhood I believe that we reduce the opportunities for a child to enjoy a wholesome and gratifying childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic group of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> provides essential support for its members, particularly, but not only, the young members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By reasserting the fact of the essential worth of the <span class="highlight">family</span> I hope to dispose of that red herring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation should do what it can to positively support the <span class="highlight">family</span> and it should, in seeking to be compassionate and just to those leaving the marriage, be very careful of the needs of all families and of other members of that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Positive assistance to a successful marriage will be afforded by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which will endeavour to provide an institution that has specialist knowledge of reconciliation procedures and opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The formation of an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies will promote the identification and understanding of the factors affecting marital and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In several years time, when people have found, as I believe they will find, that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is not only acceptable but also a positive aid to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, I might favour a shorter period of separation; but in the meantime my approach is gradual and cautious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clearly intended two-fold thrust of this Bill is to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> and to allow the humane and dignified dissolution of those marriages that have become a burden to the couple, to the children and, I suggest, to society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They foresee difficulties that will prejudice the <span class="highlight">family</span> and prejudice an injured party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued that a woman who has raised a <span class="highlight">family</span> and in the process has lost her ability to earn a respectable income can be told to get out and fend for herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 43 mention the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage and the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new Bill a divorce after 12 months may take place in a <span class="highlight">family</span> court by simply establishing separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Bill will be amended because it is not designed, as it appears to be, to encourage <span class="highlight">family</span> dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tenor of the debate indicates that honourable members on both sides of the House are desirous of ensuring that the best possible <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation is enacted, and enacted as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why I consider the period of one year separation is acceptable is that the Bill provides for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will make a tremendous difference to all areas covered by the legislation, and the operation of this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will mean that throughout the year of separation there will be a helping, ongoing court to which people can appeal and which can actually be involved in the problems surrounding the question of whether a reconciliation is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what a different situation could be created by an active, sympathetic <span class="highlight">family</span> court operating during the 12 months period of separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision for more counselling service and the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be a vast improvement and will give much greater support to <span class="highlight">family</span> unity than the concept of blame and retribution inherent in the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most distressing side effects arising out of the legal and psychological warfare associated with prolonged divorce proceedings is the bitterness and personal hatred which can split <span class="highlight">family</span> and friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change from the extended biological <span class="highlight">family</span> we had in the past to the more fragile nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>, the increase in the breadth of education for women in our society and the changing rate of opportunities for women have all made marriage a more stressful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many lawyers with whom I have discussed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill are of the opinion that it is completely fair to women and amply protects their interests and those of the children <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a strong and sometimes vitriolic public attack on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and there has been an emotional attack on it in this House itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has reached the point where those who are genuinely concerned with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill question the motives of its opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that those people who opposed abortion law reform 2 years ago and who now support the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill have a right to be shocked at how their former colleagues in that earlier fight have debased this public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, one suggestion was that a woman would allow, under the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, her husband to flaunt his intimacy with his mistress - 1 suppose the same goes for a woman flaunting u. intimacy with her lover- for 12 months in the same house in front of her and the children and that still she would have no comeback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ignores the fact that the woman- or the man- and her <span class="highlight">family</span> would be better off without the scoundrel or that she could apply for an injunction pending divorce proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have completely ignored clause 114 which allows an appeal to a court before proceedings commence so that she may bring about an injunction for physical protection, mental protection or welfare protection for herself or the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependant children; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That letter stated, in part: …. that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, as amended by the Senate, is soundly based on that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only rely on those who are intimately concerned with the values, the construction and the strength of marriage as it contributes to the individuals in that <span class="highlight">family</span> and to the nation as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, the welfare of the <span class="highlight">family</span> depends on that relationship and not simply on the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally accepted that a good <span class="highlight">family</span> law should buttress, rather than undermine, the stability of marriage and that where a marriage has irretrievably broken down the legal shell should be destroyed with the maximum fairness and with the minimum bitterness, distress and humiliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law council and an institute of <span class="highlight">family</span> studies which I hope will adopt some of the more progressive ideas and attitudes of, say, Canada where children, through a gradual increase in content of the preparation for marriage in their school syllabuses, in turn are able to assimilate a greater understanding of marriage, and to study the responsibilities- financial, moral and so on- that come with a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By creating a <span class="highlight">family</span> court, reconciliation, discussion of the marriage situation and how it should be resolved or dissolved- peacefully, without bitterness or recrimination, fairly and equitably- is encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this National Marriage Guidance Council of Australia, in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, August 1974, welcomes the removal of ‘fault’ and the introduction of ‘irretrievable breakdown’ as the sole ground for dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am writing on behalf of the Tasmanian Marriage Guidance Council to express our support for the proposed <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new examination of fault is to evaluate the future welfare and concern of all members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill outlines the principles of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court- not the old court which was highly legalistic and argumentativebased on reasonableness, discussion and welfare principles, and takes into consideration the needs of each member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and their capacity to contribute to continuing welfare outside that existing marital relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the new proceedings under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which are based on determining the continuing contribution of the partners of the dismembered marriage should be continued on a basis of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when we consider the needs of people rather than the legalistic rights of people, and base those rights on needs and contribution, that we can say we are preserving marriage, not as an outmoded institution but as a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit of welfare which will lead to a better and stronger nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have no illusions that this Bill, as it stands, produces the basis for an alternative philosophical approach to marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It introduces a new concept of marriage, <span class="highlight">family</span> and divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill passes unamended our traditional approach to marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> will undergo dramatic change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the guise of removing some of the unsatisfactory and inhuman provisions existent in our divorce laws, the Bill aids the erosion of the basic concept of marriage and the foundation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The introduction of closed courts is a humane action in the interest of <span class="highlight">family</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having acknowledge these worthy provisions I now turn to the reasons I believe this Bill provides an alternative philosophical approach to marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> life that generally flows from it are the basis on which our whole society has been built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill creates the temptation to married people to walk out at the drop of a hat and with little penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Bill stands, it further threatens the nature of the marriage contract and thus, I believe, the foundation of our society which, after all, is the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  provision  of  <span class="highlight">family</span>  courts is an  outstanding  i  j  - - - * o  one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the <span class="highlight">family</span> court structure itself will be a helping, ongoing organisation to those who are faced with a breakdown of their marriage during that period of 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of my experience, on the basis of equity, on the basis of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court structure itself, I support the 12-month period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity to enter this debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which must be one of the most significant pieces of social legislation presented to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly 2 things can be said of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the last mentioned point let me say immediately that I welcomethis was the universal opinion within my electorate- the formation of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts with marriage counselling and reconciliation assistance being made available through those <span class="highlight">family</span> courts- a comprehensive administration both of the law and the efforts at marriage counselling and reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that they are these: Firstly, the need for reform in the law and its administration; secondly, the indignity of divorce by fault as it presently is found should be removed; thirdly, that irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be the test to relieve the parties of the legal ties of marriage; fourthly, that the wife and the children should be protected upon divorce; fifthly, that so far as possible, the financial affairs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> should be settled once and for all upon divorce; and sixthly, that administration of divorce law should be as efficient and dignified as human hands can make it, and the courts and the protection of the law should be available to all who need it, irrespective of costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 43 states that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, have regard to such matters as the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if your ruling on that point confirms the ruling of your predecessor that the Bill would have to be withdrawn and redrafted and resubmitted by a Minister, I would ask what is your view concerning the contingent notice of motion that has been moved by the Minister and read by the  Clerk  earlier this morning, namely, that so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent a Minister moving that the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 be made an order for a later hour this day’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Although I had listed myself to speak on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill I had decided to withdraw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I regard it as a duty to seek to represent a concerned and informed strength of support within the Christian community for the humane proposals of the Bill, undergirded by the setting up of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, a <span class="highlight">family</span> law council and an institute of <span class="highlight">family</span> studies- aspects which have been conveniently ignored or brushed aside by the emotive claims of the ‘no fault’ argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate opposing speakers have affirmed their belief that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of Australian society or that marriage should be buttressed or that full and proper recognition should be given to wives, mothers and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that many of the amendments to the existing matrimonial causes law that have been foreshadowed in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill represent considerable advances on unsatisfactory situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who support the amendment that has been moved, and those in the community who oppose some aspects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, have been accused of sacrificing everything, so far as divorce law is concerned, on the alter of what the former Attorney-General of this Commonwealth described as ‘ecclesiastical garbage’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not support the reintroduction into the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill of the specific grounds of adultery and desertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer that insofar as any amendment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill reintroduces the concept of fault, the concept of an objective test, it should be based on grave and weighty grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support any legislation- I think this is relevant to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- which makes it possible for men and women in our society to exercise a complete choice as to the type of role they should adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reservation I had about the Bill was that the Bill should also provide for immediate access to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in the special cases of adultery and cruelty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought of the desirability of adding a fifth principle to clause 43 or of amending clause 48 to make it necessary for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to have regard to the behaviour of the parties before a decree nisi is granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the principles to be applied by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under clause 43 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-clause (b) provides for the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that, providing those supplementary principles are effectively administered in spirit and substance by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the proposal deserves support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings me to the next 2 fundamental provisions of the proposed legislation- Parts VII and VIII relating to the welfare and custody of children and to maintenance and property, which are the 2 areas where so much litigation now takes place and Part IV relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passage of time and the Standing Orders for debate prevent me from expressing my opinions on each of these matters, but I do want to say something about the welfare and custody of children, the <span class="highlight">family</span> court and the proposed amendment to Parts VII and VIII of the Bill which should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proceedings with respect to the custody or guardianship or access to a child of a marriage the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, under clause 64, have regard to the welfare of the child as of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal guidelines have been proposed in clause 75 to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has regard to those matters which must be taken into consideration in respect of maintenance of the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such cases, both as to custody and maintenance, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts will examine relevant matrimonial conduct but not the fault or degree of blame of either party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, 1 want to touch upon the concept of a separate Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court with supplementary services, which it is proposed will be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 21 is a most significant new institutional concept and will deal solely with <span class="highlight">family</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has the power under Part XIII of the Bill to enforce all decrees made under the proposed law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My continuing worry in relation to the power and operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is to ensure that its decrees and orders, particularly with regard to welfare and custody of children and maintenance of property, are observed and that responsibility for compliance with and observation of the court’s decrees remain a function of the court itself, or one of its agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the law should make it clear that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or its agencies should have the direct and primary responsibility for payment of maintenance and, where practicable, compliance with other court orders, with the complementary responsibility to ensure that the party responsible for compliance with maintenance and  other court  orders pays the corresponding amount of maintenance, with costs, to the agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That can best be achieved by an agency of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court rather than by an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marriage can be a many-splendoured thing and a <span class="highlight">family</span> a source of fulfilment, happiness, joy and laughter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But far from undermining one of the essential foundations of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic unit of society, I believe that these reforms can prevent its further decay, perhaps even strengthen the basic conditions in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been drafted to provide for easier, speedier divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attack upon marriage, the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the woman, the homemaker, the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This nation has been built on sound foundations of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the firm foundation stone of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my estimation, this all forms part of a general campaign, which has gathered momentum in recent times, to attack marriage, the home and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be directing our attention to the priceless place of a mother in the home and to assisting her to do the things that she should be doing as the queen of the household organising and ordering the <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is called the “<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not describe the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother, concerned about her <span class="highlight">family</span>, concerned about her position with the other-people in the community, knowing perhaps that her husband has not done the right thing by her, has continued to try to make a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be looking to see how we can build up the <span class="highlight">family</span>; how we can build up homes; how we can strengthen the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that the <span class="highlight">family</span> court will need to be tried in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No honourable member can fail to be moved by the deeply held beliefs of people in their own electorates who believe that the Bill is against the tenets of Christianity and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill does not interfere with the rights of practising Christians- the great majority of our population- nor does it interfere with <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about the state of the <span class="highlight">family</span> I think we are talking about a very special form of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of comment has been made about the title of this Bill- the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH these aspects of law as I understand it, are discussed under the general heading of ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> law’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is superficially somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless the state has built around the <span class="highlight">family</span> an elaborate legal structure which prescribes a minimum age for marriage and forbids marriage between close relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It regulates property relations between members while at the same time treating the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a whole in some measure as a propertyowning unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may even prescribe limiting conditions for the transmission of <span class="highlight">family</span> property from one generation to the next, although it upholds in principle the freedom of testamentary disposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reason for this close interest is that the procreation and rearing of children, which is the principal function of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, is of interest to others besides the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Precisely because children are automatically members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and can have no choice in the matter, and be-  …..  they  lIe  subject  try  parental authority their  - ——– j  - - — ~j— j~ ——– ——-  “j : - ~ -  interests must be guaranteed by the state, as it must guarantee the rights of a member of any association which exercises effective power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill goes further than any other legislation in the past to allow this to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike my friend the honourable member for Macquarie, I believe that clause 43 sets out to break down the claim that the Bill will lead to the breakdown of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which I concede may need looking at from time to time, shall have regard to the need to protect the institution of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life generally, the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their welfare, and the means available to assist parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation and the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Herald’ recently stated that people concerned about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill providing quickie divorces assumed this because the Bill allows dissolution of marriage after 12 months separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the spirit of Part II, Part III and Part IV of the Bill- the latter relating to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- is carried through, the proposed law will represent a major advance in this area over the existing Matrimonial Causes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court performing this positive service and, where reconciliation fails, playing a major role in reducing the area of disharmony and bitterness and facilitating the settlement of custody, access and property disputes, is a major feature of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But equally, I judge, a period of 12 months is too short to give respect to the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the majority of the Australian people would require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>–I rise to support the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does not really introduce a new principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could say much more about the Bill, particularly about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be eventually reformed even more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly support the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and I will not be voting for the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states: that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of the Australian society; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts as distinct from other courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some concern that a judge of 80 years will be looking at the difficult and delicate problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships of a young couple, and I would like to see other arrangements made in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in relation to the positive duty on both parents to maintain children under 18 years of age, attempts to improve counselling and reconciliation procedures and facilities are useful provisions in a difficult area of human and <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to establish a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council to review the working of this legislation and legal aid related to these matters again is a useful proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to establish an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies for research is a useful one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I see no reason why the Government should not arrange for the banks, which it has power to do, to take <span class="highlight">family</span> income into account when granting loans rather than male income only, which is the system under which banks and financial institutions operate at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by way of, or as incidental to, the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the Corporation would be able to build dwellings for Commonwealth employees, migrants, students, those who are in receipt of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for these purposes and those who are also in receipt of advances or loans from the Director of Defence Service Homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kind of thing that we want to do under this legislation is to ensure that any <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia- not in certain constitutional limits as mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta; we are not confining this to public servantsunder a certain income limit and which is paying an amount in excess of 25 per cent of average earnings for desirable and reasonably rented premises is assisted because that <span class="highlight">family</span> is paying too much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sub-clause then states that the Corporation may perform its functions in a territory; for the purpose of the provision of housing for members and former members of the defence force; by way of, or as incidental to, the provision of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances- that is the matter about which the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  had a small altercation a moment ago- for the purpose of the provision of housing for the Aboriginal people of Australia, immigrants to Australia persons employed in or by departments or authorities of Australia and persons engaged in work for Australia or any authority of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has tried to imply that by the .use of this rather nebulous placitum of section 5 1 of the Constitution which deals with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances a remarkable extension of power is going to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am most sympathetic to the use of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances power in respect of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least 25 per cent of families had no medical insurance although only one <span class="highlight">family</span> answered that they used the subsidised medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In S cases where the <span class="highlight">family</span> had no medical insurance the household head was often sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the same allowance for a single man and for a <span class="highlight">family</span> man who has <span class="highlight">family</span> obligations and three or four dependants, although his need is much greater than that of the single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That assistance will be provided not only for the construction people but also for the citizens- the <span class="highlight">family</span> men and women and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adelaide put $500,000 into the project because on the board of directors there was a member of the Holden <span class="highlight">family</span> who wanted to be part of the project, but basically it was financed by the people of Australia through the Commonwealth Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, for most people the purchase of their car is the second largest investment they make, second only to the purchase of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I have asked for Government Business to be given precedence over General Business tomorrow and the co-operation of the Opposition is to enable the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to be brought on for debate for another period of time approximating 3 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirty-nine speakers have already spoken on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and 3 1 speakers are still listed to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although 3 1 speakers are still listed to speak, I think that it is possible that if time permitted everyone in the Parliament might well want to speak on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to convey to the House the impression that this is for the very express purpose of discussing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill in relation to which I suppose it could be said that there is unprecedented interest in the community as every honorable member has been inundated with various points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, which I think every member of this House regards as having a tremendous importance, should be so relegated that it cannot be debated in any priority to Government Business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that I cannot really understand why there is the necessity for the urgency of debate on them that there is on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like seriously to register the concern that we of the Opposition have that Government Business of a character which is not contributing to the wellbeing of the individual citizens of Australia should be accorded a higher priority than a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill which is fundamental to the whole social structure of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we understand the concerns that the Leader of the House has for an early debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and while we are quite prepared to debate that measure at any time, we do not believe that this is the way by which priority should be given to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I suggest that it must have been with a good deal of reluctance that the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  even accepted the deferral of perhaps an hour or so of the consideration of Government Business in order to permit the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are disappointed that the Government has not seen fit to set aside its business program to enable the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it would be worth while for honourable members to consider that by providing the opportunity tomorrow to debate the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill they will be precluding debate in this House on the Government’s plans for northern Australian development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, given the necessity for debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to continue and our desire to pursue that debate, we will not formally oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the House, although it is with some reluctance that we accept the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took it from what he said that tomorrow we will dispense with private members’ business and discuss the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also took it that he implied that we would deal with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BDI for some 3 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know what he means by that, because he went on to say that 3 1 members desired to speak on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We spent the whole of Friday of last week discussing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and in actual fact 19 members took part in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to have some assurance that we will discuss the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill for 3 hours or 4 hours or that we will finish the debate because, after all, as I have said some members would like to speak on the subject and they do not know what priority they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, if the people outside this Parliament were given the opportunity they would certainly give higher priority, firstly, to private members’ business and, secondly, to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill than to Government business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- I think that the only legislation that the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  would not put off to enable the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to be debated would be legislation dealing with the price of wheat or wool or chaff or with other matters concerning primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, as a government, has no intention of curtailing debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conclusion of tomorrow’s debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill about 50 members will have spoken in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of having a 3 weeks’ sitting period we might well have to continue sitting for a week or two and set that time aside exclusively to deal with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful, too, that if any private members ‘ business remains to be discussed at the end of the session we will set aside a day to deal with it, like we did last Friday in regard to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debate on all of these matters has been precluded because the Government wants to rush in and talk about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to talk about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, but we were told by the Leader of the House only yesterday that we may well have to resume for a Friday sitting, that it might not be possible for the Government to set aside its business program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that with the Opposition’s co-operation we would set aside this morning to discuss the important <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today we see a filibuster in the form of a stupid motion put forward under the guise that it relates to great national events to hold up the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I would like the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to be debated so I formally move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill, as no doubt the whole of the Australian population realises now, relates to <span class="highlight">family</span> law but I think really that is a bit of a misnomer because chiefly the Bill relates to divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is principally about the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is still the basic unit of society despite the changes in the extent of its role and the nature of its role over the ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the role of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has changed quite significantly over the ages and I think that it would be unwise and unreal not to acknowledge this, but if one acknowledges as I do that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is still the basic unit of society then it also follows that marriage is an essential part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship because marriage is a public avowal of the relationship between 2 people and the rights and obligations that they both assume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is still seen as the basic unit of society and marriage is basic to the establishment of that unit then it surely follows that the dissolution of marriage should not be countenanced lightly nor unnecessarily encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking into account these broad general rules which i believe should apply in the dissolution of a marriage, we then should look at this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to ascertain whether it fulfils these aims and I do not believe it does in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mean that most Acts relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law throughout similar countries to Australia have more than one criterion for the dissolution of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not surprising that new legislation on such fundamental concerns as marriage, <span class="highlight">family</span> relations and divorce should be open to doubts and criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill would substantially improve upon the present unsatisfactory arrangements for settling and enforcing maintenance and custody, and thus more effective and fair consideration will be given to the wishes of children involved in a <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, on the positive side, the Bill provides for the establishment of special <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to take the whole gamut of <span class="highlight">family</span> law out of the daunting atmosphere of the civil and criminal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have won formidable support from many Christian and other authorities intimately interested and experienced in matrimonial law, marriage guidance and <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to provide for the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage determined by a maximum of 12 months separation to be the sole ground for divorce will remove many of the cruel and bitter experiences suffered by both parties in such a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add that in personal discussions with a number of people affected, and also with those who have passed through the present divorce proceedings, I have found that the quasi criminal type atmosphere created around what is in fact a very personal <span class="highlight">family</span> matter has had severe emotional effects on many people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it can be shown that the breakdown of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and divorce proceedings have a traumatic effect on the children as well as the adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of Parliament have been under tremendous pressure to restrict the proposed changes to the minimum but I can assure honourable members that most of them who have contacted me by letter and those with whom I have discussions, all recognise the tremendous step forward that will follow the application of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the vote is on a personal and individual basis I put it to honourable members that they have a great responsibility for the future happiness and security of large numbers of people and families who can only benefit if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In short, our marriage was a failure, we tried to preserve it and our <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you vote against the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, please read these questions below that I have asked myself so many times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 has been introduced to replace the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959-73 and with the attendant amendment has attracted attention which, if not unprecedented, is probably greater than that which would be attracted by the overwhelming proportion of legislation which enters this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued and described in simple terms as a no fault <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a no fault <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This concerns the general concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The brunt of much of the argument against the Bill appears to evolve around the desire to protect the traditional concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arguments appear to begin from the premise that the traditional concept is sacred, in some way inviolate, unchanging and immutable and that any attitude towards the nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> which tends to deviate from this traditional concept is in someway wrong, is undesirable or is immoral and therefore must be resisted at any cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept this premise about the unchanging nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> or that any change should necessarily be resisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History would indicate that such a view is quite unreal and contrary to historical fact; and in fact, the history of the <span class="highlight">family</span> is one of slow but constant change in the past and one of accelerating rate of change in contemporary society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes in the nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> have many causes and have had many manifestations in the history of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere reduction in the physical size of the <span class="highlight">family</span> from the extended <span class="highlight">family</span> of the past which embraced a wide range of relatives, down to the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span> of today, must of necessity reduce the strands which tend to hold the <span class="highlight">family</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the most significant influence on the change in attitude towards <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned with the question of consciousness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the most conspicuous outward manifestation of this phenomena has been the emancipation of women which, on the part of the younger generation particularly, has led to a complete reassessment of their role in society as partners in marriage, as parents of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and as individual people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society now has the physical means to plan rationally the size of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not here to make judgments on whether changes which have taken place in the idea and the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are less desirable, less commendable or less moral, than the old traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the motivation for survival of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as an institution ceases to exist within the <span class="highlight">family</span> itself it is absurd and in many cases inhuman to try to preserve the basis of the institution of marriage merely by legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater the degree of intervention by the State, the greater the affront to the dignity of the <span class="highlight">family</span> institution and to the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the overwhelming majority of people certainly believe in the sancity and permanence of marriage to protect the actual future of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very basis of these features is linked to <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I think it is fairly common ground, though perhaps these days not universally agreed, that the best basis of our society is the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit built around enduring marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the simple matter that many people suggest it is, and we must look at it with compassion as well as with concern for the importance of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we certainly should not in any way condone or support, even indirectly, any attack on the institutions of marriage and the familyinstitutions which I believe are the foundation of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever the <span class="highlight">family</span> flourishes in a state of vigour and unity, there will be found a strong and sound society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I think we have to accept that, if marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> are the basic institutions of our society- and I am sure the vast majority of Australians hold to that view- individual members of that society must accept some discipline and some restraints in the interests of the society of which we are all part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been impressed by a statement by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Life Movement of Australia which points out that the social problem is not so much divorce itself but the breakdown of marriage which precedes the divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Life Movement again points out, we are bogged down in relief and mopping-up operations instead of paying a great deal more attention to preparation for marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to establish <span class="highlight">family</span> courts is a welcome one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill made provision for a considerable upgrading of counselling services in preparation for marriage it would come much closer to meriting its title of the ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I restate my own belief that we have a tremendous responsibility to see that whatever we do here today does nothing to weaken or reduce marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic institutions of our society but that we make them stronger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a divorce Bill but a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly concerns divorce but it also concerns marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was referring to the amendment on which the Senate Committee intended to make recommendations to the Senate-  relates to the incorporation in the Bill of provisions to establish a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which, freed of the rigidity and formality of conventional courts, would be able to exercise jurisdiction over the whole range of ‘<span class="highlight">family</span>’ matters with dignity, informality, expedition and comparative lack of expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, far from that being the truth, the opposite is the truth and that this Bill will in fact strengthen marriage and will make for better relationships between all the members of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the discussion on the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill seems to assume that laws relating to divorce can make marriages more satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads me to believe that those who wish to perpetuate the present situation far from assisting the maintenance of stable <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships succeed in promoting the direct opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot agree with the arguments of people who say that they stand for the stability of the <span class="highlight">family</span> subjecting the children of the failed marriage to the mental cruelty which often exists at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders whether they are really interested in the <span class="highlight">family</span> or only their concept of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this change in social attitudes there is a need to adjust laws to see that the best interests of marriages, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and society generally are served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will probably be ample opportunity to do that at a later stage, but I would like to say that I believe that this Bill incorporates many advantages so far as custody, reconciliation, the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and matters concerned with injunctions are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of this House can by their vote strengthen <span class="highlight">family</span> life and give real happiness to many people who are now the victims of an unhappy relationship and at the same time lessen the most tragic effects on the lives of many thousands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia need a better law relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law and to divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the objectives of this Bill which are to make uniform provisions in areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> law outside divorce and to provide for the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 43 (a) of the Bill provides that the <span class="highlight">family</span> court in the exercise of its jurisdiction shall have regard to the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  has already expressed reservations concerning the establishment of a Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court in addition to the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, amongst others, I would prefer to see greater use being made of the proposed State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts where judges will retire at 65 years of age and that the proposal for Federal courts could be thus abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context I also question the costs of establishing a very considerable <span class="highlight">family</span> court infrastructure, in view of the limited number of appropriately qualified persons from the bar, especially in the case of New South Wales, could cause a relative fall in the standard of the judiciary with the result that the very people- the litigants whom this Bill is supposed to help- will probably have to incur increased costs in their search for a satisfactory divorce settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be quite sufficient for the State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts to have full jurisdiction and for appeals to be directed to the High Court when necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I respectfully submit that in the vast majority of marriages that is still not so and that most wives enter into marriage on the presumption that their husbands will be the main, but not necessarily the exclusive, provider for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, I applaud the acceptance in this Bill that a wife through her efforts in maintaining the home and the <span class="highlight">family</span> has made a very real contribution towards the total <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and that such contribution should be taken into account in determining any settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The atmosphere and the climate in which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been debated have, in some respects, been most unfortunate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are looking at a Bill which is designed to be a <span class="highlight">family</span> law Bill- it should be remembered that it has been called the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- and if we approach that Bill without having these principles established, woe betide us when we get the legislation that we are likely to get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we approach <span class="highlight">family</span> life and divorce, unfortunate as it is, without considering the sorts of principles to which I have referred - principles that I believe we can accept and should acceptthen I think we are on faulty ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard people espouse the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill in its entirety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stand very strongly on the basis that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is the strength of any nation and any society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the history of matrimonial causes or what is now deemed to be <span class="highlight">family</span> law it is clear that there is much room for improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the one way to guarantee <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the one way to guarantee that children will have a good <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what we have to do with this sort of legislation is to say: ‘Look, if you are going to make the <span class="highlight">family</span> a worthwhile unit in society’- and so it should be- ‘guarantee there is no poverty, guarantee there is a good housing situation and a good atmosphere in which children can be brought up, guarantee an opportunity is given to stop drunkenness and cruelty’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the compensation entitlement on a <span class="highlight">family</span> wage concept in the sense that the husband might well have accumulated assets through her care of him and the children and she has accumulated none? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That same concept does not apply in the testator’s <span class="highlight">family</span> maintenance provisions because under those no testator can deny the existence of his widow and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can say: ‘ We are part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the entitlements of these members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> be recognised in the sheer technology of the words used in the Bill- not the principles that everyone is so concerned about but the technology of the words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should guarantee that in regard to maintenance proper consideration will be given to the needs of the wife and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They support the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as being fundamental to our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost impossible to set down laws which will cater adequately for the enormous variations in differing <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe in the maintenance of marriage and in the permanence of the <span class="highlight">family</span> institution, yet I believe equally that the present matrimonial causes legislation is inadequate to meet the changing needs of our society and to meet the requirement that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit should be preserved to the maximum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, clause 43 which I support, sets out principles which relate to the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage and the need to give the widest possible protection to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have some sympathy for those who criticise the legislation simply because it is called a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I am of a mind that it would be far preferable if this legislation provided not only assistance for the <span class="highlight">family</span> at the stage at which the marriage is to be dissolved but also an opportunity for dis- . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am apprehensive that in the criticisms that seem to be levelled at the institution of marriage and the institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, people will see this Bill from a perspective of being intended to sever rather than to preserve the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>They are intent on trying to ensure what they see as the right way of preserving the <span class="highlight">family</span> relationship, yet I rather doubt that in their expression of resistance to this change they will secure what they seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having been involved as a lawyer in this jurisdiction on some occasions, I believe that the existing grounds of divorce rather tend to promote dissension within the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I first went to Vietnam in 1962-1963 I went into the hamlets and saw what was happening to those ordinary simple Vietnamese peasants who defended themselves with wooden guns because they had nothing better and whose only means of communication was to bang 2 sticks against each other so that the fellow a bit further down the road could be warned in time to try to defend himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> against the incursions of the Vietcong who would come in the night murdering, looting, plundering and stealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is enlightened legislation which would buttress marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure no honourable member in this House, willingly or unwillingly, will commit an act which will violate the sanctity of marriage or destroy the value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit unless under extreme inducement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can see that the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has read the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill in some detail and that it has engendered strong feelings in his soul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 43 deals with <span class="highlight">family</span> provisions, the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage, the need to give the widest possible protection and asistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the need to protect the rights of children and the means available for assisting parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand, we have clause 43 asserting the need to assist and preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span> and, on the other hand, we have clause 48 proposing that marriage should be brought to an end at the option of either party after a 12-months interval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what has been said and written about it, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does not concern divorce alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a comprehensive Bill, the most comprehensive Bill dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> law ever to be introduced in an Australian parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As passed by the Senate, the major provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill provide for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in Australia for the first time; the establishment of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts for the first time; the ability to seek matrimonial relief in the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, the State supreme courts or the magistrates courts without first proceeding for divorce; the abolition of all fault grounds for divorce; joint custody of children and joint responsibility for their maintenance; widely increased use of welfare officers to help in custody disputes and in the ongoing relationship between parents; the financial responsibility of each party to a marriage and to maintain the other; criteria for the provision of maintenance for spouses and children based on the applicant’s need; the establishment of a <span class="highlight">family</span> law council and an institute of <span class="highlight">family</span> studies; and greatly increased counselling opportunities relating not merely to divorce and reconciliaton but also to the on-going problems of divorced persons, particularly in relation to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, as it does, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill seeks to dismantle some of these barriers, it is a good Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not as though women are protected by the existing law concerning <span class="highlight">family</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, with its novel charter clearly indicated in the Bill, to help people rather than to act as an inscrutable referee, should be most effective in doing whatever can be done to reconcile parties whose marriages have run into difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By introducing a sane, balanced law to deal with <span class="highlight">family</span> disputes it is hoped that where marriages do break down, as they undoubtedly will continue to do under the stresses and strains of life, persons will be encouraged to adjust their transition from married life with the minimum of bitterness and animosity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With regard to the question of maintenance, I believe there is a need to protect adequately a woman who leaves the workforce for marriage and a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am fortunate enough to come from a <span class="highlight">family</span> where divorce has never occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be incomprehensible so far as my <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In arriving at those views, I have been very much influenced by the position that the <span class="highlight">family</span> holds in the society in which we live and by the position that the <span class="highlight">family</span> has held over the period m which our civilisation has existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic core unit of the society in which we have all grown up and which has existed for some centuries now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that legislators do what they can to preserve that <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at legislation which will affect families and <span class="highlight">family</span> life and which will have an effect on children, the relationship between parents and the interdependence of one individual on another if a relationship is to continue no longer, I believe that there must be- and it is very difficult to escape from- a situation where fault is taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 43 of the BUI lists the principles which will be applied by <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of the Australian society; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 48 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does not provide for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children need a stable and secure <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 48 of this Bill deprives the <span class="highlight">family</span> of security and permanence because it provides that one party to a marriage can, for whatever reason he or she thinks fit, terminate the marriage on 12 months notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill does nothing to build up marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill certainly will eliminate fault or the conduct of parties as a ground for divorce but it will not eliminate an open examination of the conduct of the parties in what are the most heartrending results of a divorce- the custody of the children of the marriage and access to them by either partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 72, as presently contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, can have this effect: A man and woman many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I would like to read an extract from one of the many letters which I have received in regard to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before I do that I want to say a word or two about the present position and give my interpretation of the general view of Australians in relation to existing laws that we now describe with the modern term of ‘ <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could gain the impression that the average reader of these articles would get some satisfaction from reading about the discomfort and misery that was being suffered by a particular <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to recite those principles, beginning with the principle that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of the Australian society; secondly, that marriage should be buttressed; thirdly, that marriage should be permanent and secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that within the <span class="highlight">family</span> court system as it is set out in this Bill this situation will be avoided in a substantial number of cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak in the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and to state a view which I would have been able to express in the Committee stage, but mostly to give an expression of opinion because this is a matter of public controversy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not espousing the interests of women today to say of a conscientious woman who is trying to preserve a marriage and is doing the right thing by her husband and <span class="highlight">family</span> that because her husband does not want her companionship any longer and she is forced from the house she must go to the Government and receive social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marriage is the very basis of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and it has been the motivation of the bread winners in the families which has kept our society as we know it today going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic element of our society is the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it says that ‘the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the basic and stable unit of Australian society’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Senate’s insistence on mentioning the establishment of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see nothing but good in relation to the Government’s original ideas in this matter, namely, that there should be a Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court established in each State or at other places considered necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is quite obvious to all honourable members that there is a much more valid reason for a divorce when 2 people, having brought up their children, they having left the <span class="highlight">family</span> nest, then decide that they have struggled on for some years under difficulties and want a divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the House should try to distinguish between those people who have been married for 10 years and perhaps have a <span class="highlight">family</span> of 5 children and the other cases that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that governments should recognise that it is not desirable in the community of the <span class="highlight">family</span> interests to make divorce in that case as easy as this Bill does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 elements of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill that most interest me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to go over all the things that have been said about the <span class="highlight">family</span> being the bulwark of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think every desperate attempt should be made to maintain the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strength of character, her almost third dimensional attitude towards sustaining the marriage that keeps the <span class="highlight">family</span> operating as an identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The telegram was addressed to Les Stewart, a highly respected gentleman of the Aboriginal community of Cherbourg, a man who has done remarkably well for himself and for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could reach the situation where, because of some discrimination on a personal basis, an Aboriginal or Islander would not be allowed to rejoin his <span class="highlight">family</span> or his friends in a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They take the view that all of us take of the piece of land that we own in our particular suburb and on which we build our home and raise our <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In today’s issue of the ‘Australian’ is an article headed ‘How they voted on <span class="highlight">family</span> bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to say: ‘The following members of the House of Representatives yesterday voted in favour of the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I cannot but feel that this is part of the program against some of us who wish to see certain sections of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill amended and that this is a deliberate campaign to distort our motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the Children’s Commission the Australian Government will provide assistance to a variety of organisations, groups and individuals for programs including full day care, <span class="highlight">family</span> day care, pre-school education, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, playgroups and any other child care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think for too long there has been a tendency for governments to fail to appreciate the acceleration of change in technology, in the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure, in marriage and divorce patterns, in mobility rates and the division of labour, in urbanisation, in ethnic and sub-culture conflict and above all in international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a child’s overall condition of upbringing would be as free of restriction owing to the circumstances of his <span class="highlight">family</span> as public action through the school could make it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others in this <span class="highlight">family</span> are the Schools Commission, mainly focusing on primary and secondary education; the Universities Commission, focusing on one section of tertiary education; and the Commission on Advanced Education, focusing on another sector of tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is partially an education commission and partially concerned with health and welfare and <span class="highlight">family</span> care for children at the pre-school stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I return to the <span class="highlight">family</span> of education commissions which are purely educational. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government consider assisting his <span class="highlight">family</span>, who I understand have to travel from Adelaide to see him in hospital? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department is looking at the matter at the moment to see whether there is any possible way of assisting  Mr Sasche  and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were not bad enough, soldier settlers are probably the epitome of those who we, on this side of the House- and before the election many honourable members who are now in Government- asserted were the lifeblood of the rural sector for they are <span class="highlight">family</span> farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one consequence of the application of rural policy by this Government which has affected a group more than any other it is that the complete failure of the rural policies of this Government has made it almost impossible for the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it has made it impossible for the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer, how much worse it is for soldier settlers for they are constricted in ways that do not pertain to the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in the provisions of rural reconstruction the average <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer is able to resort, in extremis, to rural reconstruction boards and to receive assistance for farm build-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters from the chamber demonstrates that this Government has no concern whatsoever for the plight of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer, particularly the soldier settler who in the past has been assisted to establish himself on a block of land and who now fails not only because of market exigencies but significantly because of the degree to which, through changes in assistance schemes and tax concessions, the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer no longer is regarded as being a worthwhile unit of production in the Australian scene according to the laws of Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The element that is different is that this Government has aggravated the circumstances of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer to the point where costs have completely outstripped the prospect of reasonable economic return, and for many the future is extraordinarily bleak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obviously important for a government which is concerned about poverty to have some idea of the way in which expenditure changes with increased income for a given <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The questionnaire even makes provision for it being a <span class="highlight">family</span> loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should any citizen in this country have to name to some agent of a government a member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who is lending him money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not reject the need for governments to obtain some information in order to plan for the future but I would like to know what good reason there is for requesting John Citizen to provide information about which member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> lent him money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went, accidentally, to the home of one census collector a few short years ago and I was alarmed to see the stack of forms on the floor in the <span class="highlight">family</span> living room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Special Minister of State will say that the interviewers are sworn to secrecy, but why should that person have to divulge all the private details of his life and of the lives of members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> just to satisfy a government requirement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case which I cited earlier, and to which the Minister did not refer, people were asked to name the member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> who had lent them the money to go for a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will give them the opportunity to give and share their contributions to our human <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will not help John Citizen, his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The houses are built so close together that it is difficult for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to obtain much degree of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the phrase ‘private transport’ in the sense that every person who owns a motor car or other vehicle for personal or <span class="highlight">family</span> transport will be subject to the Inter-State Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum allowance is $450, subject to a means test, and the full amount is payable when a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income does not exeed $3,500 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each $5 by which the adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income exceeds this amount the allowance paid is reduced by $1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At $5,675 per annum of adjusted <span class="highlight">family</span> income, the minimum allowance received is $15 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be said that as a result of that the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer is being prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All are patterned according to the housewife’s requirements, the dietary needs of her <span class="highlight">family</span> and her assessments of the nutritional balance that the <span class="highlight">family</span> needs, but fundamentally according to her ability to pay for the products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Allow $35 for rent, a figure 1 know they pay, $30 for each of the 2 cars they run, and they have a ‘<span class="highlight">family</span>’ income of $ 1 2 1 after housing and transport expenses are paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be great for the man who is out of work, who has a <span class="highlight">family</span> and commitments and who may be listening to this debate, to be told that he is a bludger because he is collecting unemployment benefits because he cannot get a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such an approach has the unfortunate consequence apparently deplored by the Minister for Education that it assumes the eclipse of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, and in particular the mother, must be clarified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is now a growing public recognition and expression of the view that there is no ideal substitute for home and <span class="highlight">family</span> life for the young child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must endorse the trend to <span class="highlight">family</span> orientation of child care by strengthening the capabilities of families with measures designed to improve their social and economic conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As pointed out by the paper on <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare published by the Social Welfare Commission, Australia lacks a coherent <span class="highlight">family</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In doing so we have often hindered rather than fostered the normal growth and development of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a nurturing unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Growing numbers of families find themselves unable to reconcile the financial difference between the childless, 2 -income situation of early married life with the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> role that comes with parenthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of mothers of infants and pre-school children the decision is often taken with misgivings- a sense of guilt on the part of the mother and feelings of inadequacy on the part of the father- often with resulting tensions and disruptions to normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother who is not employed at all, frequently because she believes it is in her <span class="highlight">family</span>’s interest that it have her full time care, is disadvantaged and in fact often ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much legislation discriminates against the normal 2-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> and, in addition, places 2 -income families in an advantaged position when compared with those families where the wife and mother stays at home to care for her children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressure of opinion is building up in favour of measures designed not to prevent mothers who, for personal reasons, want to continue their careers, from doing so but aimed at helping those who, solely for economic reasons, feel obliged to leave their children in the care of others so that they can earn a second wage for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In it the Union drew attention to the hardship caused to the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> by excessive taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This burden can be overcome in 2 ways: Either by the mother, irrespective of the ages of her children, going to work, or by significant tax reforms so that the current discrimination against the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> is removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These and many other proposals, such as some form of <span class="highlight">family</span> income maintenance or a mothers’ allowance, are deserving of detailed study and appraisal in an attempt to design a policy for the care and education of the pre-school child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally important is the design of policies and programs which will enable the mother of young children, while giving primary importance to her role as a mother, to maintain her interests and social contacts in such a way that the combination gives her, taking life as a whole, adequate opportunity for self-realisation, both within and apart from the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each <span class="highlight">family</span>, if it wishes, should be able to find a type of support which has been described by Margaret Mead as the process of ‘re-surrounding the nuclear <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In designing tax and social security programs we have so often been wholly absorbed in achieving an equitable vertical redistribution of income between the wealthy and the needy that we have overlooked the importance of the longitudinal redistribution between the more affluent periods of our lifespan and those where the requirement and demand on <span class="highlight">family</span> resources are great and, unless they are supplemented, place us in the category of the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though it is most desirable that <span class="highlight">family</span> day care schemes should be expanded, this should occur only if subject to close supervision and regulation as to the standards of care to be made available in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> day care has its strengths and weaknesses, but care provided by those working in a substitute mother role through the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care schemes needs to be evaluated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this would give a more <span class="highlight">family</span> atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sad fact is that up till now preschooling originally intended by us as an important aid in removing or modifying inequalities of background, environment, <span class="highlight">family</span> income and <span class="highlight">family</span> nationality- had primarily benefited children whose mothers could afford to stay at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a program as the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care scheme is an outstanding recognition of this fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it not throw that charge at the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The single income <span class="highlight">family</span>, which has become increasingly beset with difficulties, economic and social, has again been put aside as a problem which perhaps can resolve itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these questions and proposals emanating from the Bill are attached directly to whether we continue to accept the one income <span class="highlight">family</span> as the norm within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are increasingly accepting a multiple income <span class="highlight">family</span> as the pacesetter in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we justify this as a measure to offset the impact of inflation, it may well be argued in some cases whether the multiple income <span class="highlight">family</span> is indeed not contributing to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We tend here to denigrate the status of motherhood and the status of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not invite argument as to what the status of the <span class="highlight">family</span> actually may be in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these activities may become increasingly questionable if we transfer the critical responsibilities of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again this denigrates the traditional <span class="highlight">family</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that, as a complement to this Commission in endeavouring to relieve the problems of our young, the Government and society as a whole must initiate an investigation and give the most serious thought to whether we have changed our social structure so much that the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> now becomes an anachronism and whether we must make all those necessary adjustments to establish a new norm by which people may reasonably set their standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State in which he indicated that some of the other services which would be provided would include full day care, <span class="highlight">family</span> day care, pre-school education of course, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and other child care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, if the $75m which is proposed to be spent under this measure becomes a substitute for money that would otherwise be spent on <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance available to parents of children in the home, are we to say that that represents a net improvement in respect of the care of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time one must bear in mind that the <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance available to parents of children to spend in their homes for a <span class="highlight">family</span> has declined from 1.7 per cent of the gross domestic product to .4 per cent of the gross domestic product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance programs in Australia which have hitherto been carried out have abided by the principle of freedom of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are internal affairs- <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs, if you like- and because of this they are fought with a ferocity and intensity far surpassing those of conventional wars between nation states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Civil wars are <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs; they are no concern of outsiders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one intervenes in a <span class="highlight">family</span> quarrel one usually incurs the enmity of both sides either for what one has done or for what one has failed to do for one or the other party to the quarrel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These sorts of things are the things that people of my own political beliefs love and promote- the world becoming one <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it ill becomes the honourable member for Mackellar to get on to a theme of that sort at this time in the twentieth century when I can see the people of the world, despite the differences in political ideology, becoming one <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, when a government intrudes into intimate institutions such as the <span class="highlight">family</span> and when it intrudes into the responsibilities of families with respect to children, the power of that government will play a very great role in determining ultimately the values of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some years ago <span class="highlight">family</span> assistance for 2 children would have bought 18 loaves of bread in a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not enough for a government to say that, with the birth of every child a <span class="highlight">family</span> can be driven into pauperism and then to say that that <span class="highlight">family</span>, having been driven into pauperism by the government’s taxation policy, will have services made available to it outside the home under conditions that the government determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not ignore the use of homes for <span class="highlight">family</span> day care where trained personnel could assist mothers of suitable temperament in this situation to look after their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This work ranges through full day care, <span class="highlight">family</span> day care, pre-school education, emergency care, occasional care and before and after school care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit must reign supreme if we are to breed children with the desired qualities to maintain Australia as a great nation, keeping it abreast of the ever changing world and, indeed, if possible keeping it in the forefront with other great nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to sound a note of warning about <span class="highlight">family</span> unit care that is being looked at by the Interim Commission and will no doubt be continued by the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously rigid controls and frequent checks on families who conduct these <span class="highlight">family</span> unit care centres will be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in Vancouver an Act to provide for <span class="highlight">family</span> unit care came into effect in 1971 and was discontinued in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surveys have shown that children in <span class="highlight">family</span> or home groups do not receive the same benefit and stimulation as is available in larger group institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit care possibly could have some valuable application in small country centres or perhaps in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be asked: Why should a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one breadwinner have to pay for the care of children of families who have 2 breadwinners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being so, why should such a <span class="highlight">family</span> be penalised by having to pay through taxation for the care of children of families who are receiving that second pay packet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If child care centres, for example, are paid for by the community what we are doing is taxing everybody to pay for the children of the 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> to be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission mentions the problem of a number of children in a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which there is only a mother and no father at home, and deals with the problem that that mother has in paying for child care in this institution out of the pension and other benefits that she receives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicate that there is a need in this same area for <span class="highlight">family</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have drawn to the Minister’s attention a request for funds under the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care scheme by the same people whom he met when he came out to open the Telopea Church of Christ Child Care Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that centre the <span class="highlight">family</span> day care concept radiates out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> may have three or four children with the mother at home looking after those three or four sick children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The intention of the Government to stamp its own philosophy upon all the institutions of Australia, including the most basic institution of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, is regrettable and is completely indefensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the tax saving for a taxpayer and his wife, with 3 dependants, on $8,000 per annum is $338.40, compared with a saving for a taxpayer in the same <span class="highlight">family</span> situation on $5,000 per annum-that is $3,000 less-of only $145.12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The young people of Australia in future will be denied all the security, freedom of choice and expresson, and stable <span class="highlight">family</span> life which are a direct product of home ownership, and which most Australians have grown to accept as of right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The benefits of the scheme for a one income <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving $6,000 a year with a $15,000 loan will be $7.40 a week if the interest on their mortgage is 9Vi per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The benefit received by a <span class="highlight">family</span> is not as great as that received by a single person making the same interest payments because the percentate of interest deductible is not affected by the <span class="highlight">family</span> size, being based on actual income before personal deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has crested great interest throughout the community and in both Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this motion needs to be considered in the same way as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has no objection to paragraph ( 1 ) (a) (ii) which suggests that we should initiate debate on clause 48 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say to the House that we are completely in accord with the idea of initiating debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill at clause 48 which is, after all, the core in a consideration of the legislation and indicates the nature of the changes which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill itself proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not even half the members of this Parliament have had an opportunity to speak to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason why that cannot happen in respect of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Leader of the House, this great advocate of democracy, proposes to suspend the opportunity for members of this chamber to talk on matters of public importance until the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to deny the opportunity to raise a matter of public importance until the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been disposed of is absolute nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think it is important that there be adequate opportunities for debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to suggest that there should be no further discussion of matters of public importance until the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been disposed of and to suggest that only 5 minutes be allowed for a member to discuss matters in the Committee stage is to deny members of this Parliament the opportunity adequately to exercise their responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point that emerges from subparagraph (b) of the motion is that it is proposed that Government Business shall take precedence over General Business on each sitting day until the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, not only will members of the Opposition be denied the opportunity to discuss matters of public importance, but the motion will mean that if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is not disposed of by next Thursday there goes General Business day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been disposed of, Government Business is to take precedence on Thursday mornings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite important in respect of legislation on which 153 amendments have already been advised to the Parliament, which is of tremendous importance to this nation and which covers a matter of fundamental importance to the country- the whole concept of the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>- that there should be an adequate opportunity for debate on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there are so many matters of objectionparticularly the 5-minute constraint, the elimination of discussions of matters of public importance and the giving of precedence to Government Business until the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has been disposed of- the Opposition intends to vote against this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I raise something which will concern your own administration of the House during the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying to create in those who are in the industry the greatest fear of all- that of unemployment- without regard to the effect it has on the bread winners of the <span class="highlight">family</span> or the dependants of the families employed in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not easy for a pensioner to make ends meet and to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to advise honourable members that at the conclusion of consideration of clause 48 I intend to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the Committee to postpone consideration of clauses 1 to 20 until after consideration of clause 21  which deals with the creation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill in clause 43 recognises this and commits both Parliament and courts to the preservation of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present clause therefore fails to achieve the fundamental object of the Bill, namely, to support the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In defended divorce cases the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will not eliminate humiliation, bitterness and embarrassment even if we accepted the quite unwarranted assumption that under the new dissolution proceedings no such feelings will be suffered by the party who is divorced against his or her will by a spouse whose action or conduct ended cohabitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It remains certain that if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is enacted the type of bitter exchanges which evoke such feelings will be merely transferred from the dissolution proceedings to the custody and maintenance proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one party decides to go to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to apply for the assistance of the counselling facilities of the Court there is no provision in Part III of the Bill, as I see it, which enables the Court to insist that counselling take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>worrying about his health, finances, their <span class="highlight">family</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I implore you to work for more than the 92 amendments already made: Some of the above is happening to me and my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not these things can be examined in a <span class="highlight">family</span> court, they cannot be brought forward as a reason for divorce, and therefore that is better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to forget that what the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act will do, as the Matrimonial Causes Act which the Bill intends to replace already does, is establish the legal rights of parties to a marriage upon the dissolution of that marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those, old fashioned if honourable members like, who still think that the perpetuation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is the bulwark of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In my speech during the second reading debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill I intimated that I would move an amendment to clause 48 which would seek to do a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support clause 48 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a wonder we try to pass the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill at all if we are, in fact, going to reintroduce fault as a basis for the dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense I opt for the judgment of 2 years and I believe I am putting my view responsibly to the Committee in saying that if there is doubt in a matter which concerns the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in such a fundamental way, in a matter which concerns the whole fabric of Australian society, this House has a direct and important responsibility to hasten slowly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that State a <span class="highlight">family</span> law division has been set up and it has been working very well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if we find ourselves with another 6 Federal judges and perhaps 13 or 20 <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges we will have a surplus of judges in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be used for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all the daisy in the dell descriptions, surely this is it- a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to deal with a matter that has absolutely nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">family</span> at all, other than to disrupt it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  to come in here and to press upon the Committee of the House of Representatives the description of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, almost as though it will be a court to deal with matters in some clinical, detached, dispassionate way, was one of the aching forms of separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just deal with this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia was admirably made by my friend, the honourable member for Wentworth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be any sense of realism regarding this matter, the Committee will come to grips with what is involved and, that is, that if there is to be a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- I think this is a completely unnecessary proposal- there should be an effort to secure that those who sit upon it, if I may say so with infinite respect to age, should have a more gentle understanding of the problems of contemporary society than those swept into the state of octogenarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General shows scant regard for the immense distances involved in this country when he says of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court that it will, as a display in perambulation or as a peripatetic court, wander around the great State of Queensland in the same way as the Supreme Court does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does my friend the Attorney-General seriously suggest that judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be able to turn in a comparable performance at least in terms of regularity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite my friend to reflect earnestly upon the practical problem of members of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court giving the same sense of service to people as do the present justices of the Supreme Courts of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that this clause is one of the contributions which this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will make to matters associated with divorce and the dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand the sneers which the 2 honourable gentlemen have hurled at this suggestion of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, at the people who may be appointed to it and at the probability of people who are appointed to the Federal jurisdiction being able to carry out their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which is proposed in this Bill will give a lot more time than half an hour to each case in this involved and complex matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those figures are correct I think there is every reason in the world for a <span class="highlight">family</span> court to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government Party some time ago decided to support the establishment of a Superior Court which, of course, incorporated the <span class="highlight">family</span> court concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there are matters which the States can handle probably better than a central government but there are also matters that the central Government can handle far better than the States and, in respect of this uniform law which will affect all the States and all the people of Australia, I suggest it is to the advantage of the people who will have to come before this <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to have a uniform court with uniform ideals and with people who are working in the same direction and under the same direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder they do not want to see the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court concept accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill is to function in the way we hope it will, and if this law is to be the law we hope it will be, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has to be established in the way it is proposed in this Bill, otherwise the whole purpose of the Bill is lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge honourable members, and especially those on the Government side who made a conscious decision to support the Superior Court concept in Australia, to support the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court because without it the proposed law is virtually useless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If judges of the High Court are allowed to continue to sit as judges that should apply also to judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, my very strong personal view is that all judges should retire at about 70 years of age regardless of whether th_ey.be judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the High  Court  or any other court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in South Australia a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court such as is proposed by this Bill is already, in existence and works well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to adjudicate in the arena of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly would be thrust upon them the job of adjudicating upon the questions which would be raised in a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that a lot of the opposition to the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is nothing but sheer and utter humbug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The question of whether a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be established is a matter about which I am not entirely dogmatic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been drawn into this debate by some of the extraordinary arguments that have been advanced during the course of it by the protagonists in favour of the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does not establish uniformity in divorce law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of whether or not we should have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court can be decided only on balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must take the opposite view entirely from the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  because I think he has totally missed the concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total concept, surely, in relation to many of the clauses contained in this Bill is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court concept should not be riddled with legality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me turn to the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court about which I am not entirely lacking in knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in South Australia is not set up as an Act of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have to use the resources of the Supreme Court, most of which are either inadequate or not competent in this particular field- I back up my friend, the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)-  but they are also having to drag on the resources of local courts, marriage guidance counsellors and on all sorts of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of the concept of this Bill is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be something quite different from the courts of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running on from that argument, I accept that, in general, anything would be better than the current situation in Australia, and if State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts can be set up throughout Australia operating in the image of the South Australian court, it will be a good thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, and those <span class="highlight">family</span> courts that are to be established pursuant to clause 41, will operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The explanatory memorandum states that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia has jurisdiction in any matrimonial cause instituted or continued under the Bill, any proceedings instituted or continued under the Marriage Act and so on, and other matters are mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the clauses do give to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia the possibility that it will be hearing not just matters on appeal but matters of first instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like the Attorney-General to indicate how he envisages these clauses would operate before I would vote in favour of the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, I was in favour of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court that would exercise an appellate jurisdiction and that would enable the various courts to be established under clause 41 to exercise jurisdiction in a similar way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the view that I had when I saw the proposal for a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was my view that the Commonwealth, when it seeks under clause 41 of the Bill to institute agreements with the States, would be able to establish courts that would exercise jurisdiction in the same way in which he envisaged the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia would exercise jurisdictionin other words, that the judges would exercise their jurisdiction in the same humane way, taking cognisance of the same human factors, and that there would be appointed judges having the same variety of experience that he saw in judges appointed under the parts of this Bill dealing with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely there should be a place for a <span class="highlight">family</span> court whose first objective must be to explore the possibility of reconciliation in a matrimonial matter and which would have the function of dealing with those matters where there is consent, where there is no contest in the court between 2 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> court should be able to make an order without the apparatus of law if there is that kind of consent between the 2 parties, and in a matrimonial cause there are 2 parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is done and if there is a proper apparatus towards this objective, if we can have a <span class="highlight">family</span> court which is not half informal- as this kind of hybrid court is- but an entirely informal court without the function of being able to judge between 2 people who are opposed to one another but with the function of registering an agreement which they have made in accordance with law and after the satisfaction of the criteria laid down by the Bill, I think we would have something sensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the <span class="highlight">family</span> court which we create by this Bill should be quite different from the kind of <span class="highlight">family</span> court which is envisaged by the Bill itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that sort of thinking that has led to the move to create a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposition that there should be a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia finds opposition from people who either defend the law because it is the best of all possible worlds or take some kind of extreme <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will make it possible for divorce and <span class="highlight">family</span> matters to be resolved in a simple way, an easy way, an informal way and a way that removes the cant, the hypocrisy and the terror that in the minds of some people are associated with the legal process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Angas, speaking as a non-lawyer, knows of the success of the <span class="highlight">family</span> court in South Australia where informality reigns, where people are able to go and have their <span class="highlight">family</span> problems adjusted and assisted, and where divorces are given when they are required in a civilised and dignified way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I remind honourable members of some of the features of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court set up by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By reason of training, experience and personality, the judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have to be suitable persons to deal in matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that there should be a <span class="highlight">family</span> court came as a non-party measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are supporters of States rights, like the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  forget in their hysteria clause 41, which requires the government of the day to try to reach agreement with the States to have the States set up their <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be only in the absence of agreement or something of that sort that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia would function in this exclusive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If practising Roman Catholics do not feel that they can bring themselves to utilise the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, under my proposal they could at least live apart from one another protected not merely by the injunctive provisions of the Bill but also by a recognition written into a variety of clauses in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, wherever reference to ‘dissolution of marriage’ occurs the words ‘or judicial separation’ would be put, thereby providing for those who feel that they cannot utilise the very real benefits of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill by permitting them at least to be separated, to have the various custody, maintenance and other provisions applying and not to break their deep-seated religious faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not disguise my misgiving as to whether or not ‘proceeding in a court ‘ means a court which is involved in matrimonial affairs- that is to say a <span class="highlight">family</span> court or one of the supreme courts of the States exercising jurisdiction under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the further case of a testator’s <span class="highlight">family</span> maintenance proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people are suggesting that this whole Bill is not in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, this Bill- the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, as it is so delightfully described- provides that a married person may leave Australia, go to a foreign country where customs are different, where the laws are different and where traditions are very much strange and foreign to our own, enter into a union with a spouse and return to Australia with another wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The learned gentleman talks about State laws- Testator’s <span class="highlight">Family</span> Maintenance Acts, State workers compensation laws and a whole range of particular State laws that give an entitlement to a person if that person has a particular status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not affect in any way the New South Wales Workers Compensation Act, the New South Wales Testator’s <span class="highlight">Family</span> Maintenance Act or whatever may be the appropriate Queensland statutes that deal with the granting of some kind of relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of proceedings under this Act -  in other words, for the purposes of <span class="highlight">family</span> law and matrimonial causes-  a union in the nature of a marriage which is, or has at any time been - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this new principle or fact is accepted in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill we will have imported a very significant new practice and new recognition into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Gormly stated that clause 6 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974 would, if enacted, permit Australians to contract polygamous marriages abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, like section 6a of the present Matrimonial Causes Act 1959, is intended to overcome the ancient English decision of Hyde v. Hyde, in which it was held that English courts could not grant matrimonial relief to parties to a polygamous marriage, either to dissolve it if it was valid or to annul it if it was void. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Enderby)-In sub-clause (6) (a) after ‘Welfare’, insert’ of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the marriage has irretrievably broken down, it should be dissolved; but it should not be presumed that the breakdown is irretrievable, particularly where there are children, unless every effort has been made to restore communication so that the children can have the opportunity to live in a stable, happy, 2-parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that it involves counselling a large number of families; but the price involved in providing that counselling for a large number of families, if it gives a happy <span class="highlight">family</span> life in a 2-parent situation for a significant number of children, is worth paying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last evening it was suggested in a debate peripheral to this measure- this clause, indeed, and one or two others- that we have enough legalities and that those appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- this was certainly one of the inferences to be drawnwould be people skilled in the understanding of the ways of humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the people to be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to be people with legal qualifications or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly until last night the whole provision in clause 21- the creation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia- was open to a considerable amount of uncertainty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by reason of training, experience and personality, he is a suitable person to deal with matters of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is relatively little experience in <span class="highlight">family</span> court work in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only <span class="highlight">family</span> court that has been in existence for any period of time- and indeed that court for only a short time- is the South Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That court has been universally applauded as having been a very successful experiment, one which obviously influenced a number of members of the Senate, from which this Bill came, one which obviously influenced a number of honourable members in this chamber who now consider the Bill, and one which led last night to the rejection of the move against the <span class="highlight">family</span> court provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the emphasis being placed on informality and on a new approach to solving the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> a wide discretion is being given to the judges who make up the court to devise the writs and the orders that they will be able to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to this Part, the Supreme Court of each State is invested with federal jurisdiction, and jurisdiction is conferred on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and on the Supreme Court of each Territory, to hear and determine- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Ellicott)- In sub-clause (5), omit ‘on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course one has to accept the proposition that there will be a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have in mind that even though a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is to be established and even though there may be concurrent jurisdiction in supreme courts, I think the Attorney-General will be familiar with the problem of jurisdiction being exercised in country areas where perhaps the State supreme court does not sit or where there are not the funds or the opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, where the judges are members of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, they may so sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a little indulgence,  Mr Chairman,  I wish to make the point that I am anxious, now that we are obviously going to pass this law, to be able to embark upon attempts to reach agreement with the States on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court issue during the Parliamentary recess which is approaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill contains provisions for the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>which would ultimately exercise all the jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Attorney-General is aware, the provisions of clause 21 of this Bill restrict the number of <span class="highlight">family</span> court judges to six. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of that sub-clause is that it was included, as I understand it, in the Senate Committee stage of this Bill as a brake on the Attorney-General in his appointment of judges, as the Senate Committee of the whole felt that the requirements of clause 41 should be adhered to and felt rather strongly that these <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, both for constitutional reasons and for other reasons, ought to be established in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They alone, in other words, can provide an effective <span class="highlight">family</span> court system under the present constitutional structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of tremendous importance, not only to the Senate but also to those of us who have some faith in the <span class="highlight">family</span> court system as such, that this provision be adhered to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Ellicott)-Omit ‘The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any’, substitute ‘Any’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, to the extent to which it is not contrary to this Act, have regard to - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to ‘the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage’, ‘the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society’, the responsibility for the care and education of dependent children, ‘the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their welfare’, and ‘the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(78a) clause 43 relates to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to the matters to which it must have regard when exercising jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if there is one thing that we would want to establish in this country- we should certainly establish it for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court -it is that marriage is permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when the matter was debated in the Senate, this was one of the clauses which was amended to bring before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court the prime reason for marriage; that is, that it is permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that having the clause as it is provides no difficulty for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, whatever the circumstances may be, because the court will take notice of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a <span class="highlight">family</span> court should take into consideration circumstances which have been traditional and which still are present through much of our community, that a woman who gets married expects to be looked after by her husband and, even if the marriage breaks down, expects still to have some right to the protection of the law and some right to be looked after by the person she married at an earlier time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I believe that this additional principle is one that ought to be taken into account when <span class="highlight">family</span> courts come to make their decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the purpose of clause 43 is to state the broad principles which ought to be applied by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in exercising its jurisdiction, and if we are to include any principles in that, surely there ought to be room for the expression of the principle that there is a need to protect a woman within marriage who, in the exercise of choice, opts for the full time wife or mother role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would appreciate it if the Attorney-General could give an undertaking that the proposed <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My only suggestion to the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  is that this is a reason why the amendment to the prohibited degrees ought to be a matter for the Marriage Act being amended, rather than the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why the list of prohibited relationships which are in the present Act are not included in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill does not seek to alter completely what are prohibited relationships, there ought to be an answer to the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aspect that troubles me is the one which was pointed out by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  who said that there are categories listed in the Marriage Act which are not discussed as definitely in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems anomalous that certain marriages are debarred in the Marriage Act but permitted for divorce reasons in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Attorney-General, as the principal law officer of the country, seriously contend that a judge should say to a woman who has been so utterly bereft of <span class="highlight">family</span> and parental responsibility that merely because sheisthe mother she should not have custody of the children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is only the second time on which I have risen to speak on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us contemplate the situation where the husband has left the home and the mother is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the <span class="highlight">family</span> and paying the debts that come her way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court will not look upon her as the woman, the mother, the wife, the bearer of children, the one responsible for the upbringing of the <span class="highlight">family</span>; it will look upon her as just another person, another party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But her offspring reach a stage when they no longer need protection from the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rather hope that the majority of members of this Parliament are prepared to vote in favour of this amendment to ensure, if in fact there is some doubt about it, as I believe there is, the rights and the protection of women under this new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It suggests that if the parties have reached an agreement, that agreement shall be ratified in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court unless there is good cause to the contrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motive for doing this is to reduce the legalism in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to reduce the opportunity for legal representation in that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will be proceeded with immediately after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should not hold up unduly consideration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 , Government Business, further consideraton of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill 1974, being called on forthwith and having precedence until disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  has given his explanation that there are a number of matters of urgent Government business which he seeks to take as matters precedent to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why I move this motion is that the very nature of the resolution passed by this House a few days ago, at the insistence of the Leader of the House, precludes us on this side of the chamber from canvassing any other matters whatsoever while the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill remains unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second reason why I move the motion is that the debate over the last 2 days has demonstrated a widespread concern in the Parliament that there should be an expeditious consideration and deliberation of each of the several measures contained within the proposals of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no opportunity for private member’s business to be introduced as the Standing Orders provide, until such time as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably he changed his mind on the third occasion and was not prepared to allow the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to continue until such time as it was finalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have moved the motion for the suspension of standing orders so that honourable members on this side of the House and honourable members on the other side of the House can conclude those contributions which we believe need to be made to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and so that we can canvass other matters of significant public concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot be raised until we have disposed of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think it is quite critical that we dispose of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill so that matters of national importance- in addition to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill- can adequately be canvassed in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not sufficient for the Leader of the House to say that later on this day we will get on with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to be brought on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to talk about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot talk about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to the exclusion of all other matters in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am moving for the suspension of standing orders so that we can talk about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and then talk about all these other matters about which the people of Australia are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, on this side of the House, believe that for that reason it is far preferable to initiate this morning’s business by proceeding immediately with the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill should continue until it is concluded and then we can proceed to the business as listed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I have moved the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one turns to the question of priority- I am not being discourteous to my friend, the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)-  I would submit to the House that a Bill relating to the Canberra College of Advanced Education should not claim priority over the conclusion of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What priority should that command over the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main argument put to the House by the honourable member for New England this morning was: By dint of the manner in which the Government has contrived to arrange consideration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, this House is virtually gagged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To think that matters of grave public importance cannot be discussed until such time as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is debated in full is absolutely outrageous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  who has just spoken, mentioned the need to speed up the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Moreton was not prepared to conclude the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member was fair dinkum last night he would have stayed all night but he wanted to go home at 10.35 p.m. Today, with all that pomposity that can come only from a small debts lawyer, he stands up in this Parliament and tells us that we have to proceed with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill without further delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It set out in some detail the arrangements which would be made to cover the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuation of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill could have waited until doomsday as long as the beef industry Bill was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we have to defend them against the actions of the Country Party indicates that it is using the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delay in the continuation of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will not be very great by reason of the fact that a number of important Bills is to be introduced and that there are also to be debates on electoral redistributions in 2 States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill will then proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of no use honourable members opposite, particularly the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party and the honourable member for Moreton, grandstanding on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is not supposed to be a lawyers’ paradise for argument in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It just seeks to give the impression that the Labor Government is holding up the passage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, which is not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the insincerity of honourable members opposite has been proved by the fact that the honourable member who seconded the motion wanted to curtail the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill at about 10.35 last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest to honourable members opposite that they should accept the explanation that I have given and allow the Parliament to get on with all speed to the continuation of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill and to the consideration and finalisation of other business and not hold up the time of this Parliament unnecessarily for about 25 minutes on a motion on which they know that they have not much support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite should not forget that the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill may well go on until this time next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable members opposite that they should accept as such the importance of the legislation to which we have given priority, debate what is before them and then get on with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the honourable members who will support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders asked us to suspend everything half an hour ago to bring on the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  even prior to the Commissioners being appointed said in his <span class="highlight">family</span> newspaper the Advertiser’ that the Labor Party would try to win Sturt by hook or by crook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(1) Except as provided in this section, it shall be an offence for any person to solicit or accept a fee for representing or appearing for a party in a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or a court discharging the functions of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>( 1 ) Where a party to a matter before a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or a court discharging the functions of a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court so requests, the Director of Counselling and Welfare shall assign an adviser to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>131 circulated in my name which is framed in such a way as to provide informality in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that anybody aggrieved by any decision of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should have full access, on appeal, to another court and in that other court should have full access to legal opinion and legal advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are to have a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court where there is the minimum of legality it would be a good thing if paid lawyers did not appear in that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is meant to be a court primarily of reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I am concerned with is the first and preliminary hearing in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court finds in a way which is satisfactory to both parties and which they would both consider fair- I believe in 95 per cent of the cases it would be like that- there is surely no reason for paid legal representation in that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or <span class="highlight">family</span> counselling service or tribunal- call it what you like- primarily should be a body concerned with reconciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be very good if in that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court we did not have paid lawyers representing the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe it would be very much in the spirit of this Bill if we were to say that in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court there should not be legal representation and that parties should come forward and try to put their cases in a way which minimises bitternesses and which enables reconciliation to take place if it be at all possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it be found that reconciliation is not possible let the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court be given with the minimum of bitterness, the minimum of contention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If persons not versed in the difficulties in the field of the settlement of property, as an example, were to appear in a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in respect of such a dispute, whatever might be their role, I say with great respect that we would have no end of appeals going to the appellant court, which the honourable member proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question immediately arises: Who will have the responsibility of enforcing the decree or order of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the amendment that I have just moved is to give jurisdiction by regulation to an officer of the court, or an authority or a person specified in the regulation to take proceedings to ensure the payment of those moneys on behalf of the person entitled to the moneys payable under the order; in other words, to relieve the person entitled to maintenance, under an order of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, of the obligation himself or herself to institute and to pursue to finality <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, when considering the relevant regulations, care will be taken to see that they are drafted in such a way as to ensure that the amount of maintenance is automatically paid to the party entitled, with recourse by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or its agency to the party actually responsible for payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective of my amendment, I repeat, is to relieve the person who has had the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court order of the obligation to take the initiating action before the court or other agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the fact, as I have done on numerous occasions and as some of those honourable members who have supported me on this Bill have done, that this Act as it stands still allows for conduct and behaviour to be taken into account by the <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the injunction power can be used to protect and preserve the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council shall consist of a Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and such other judges, officers of the Public Service of Australia or of a State, representatives of marriage counselling organizations and other persons as the AttorneyGeneral thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Chairman, I wish to move an amendment to clause 1 1 5 which concerns the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and which is dealt with in this miscellaneous part of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not read through the methods of appointment or what the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council aims to do, as set out in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is designed to correct the situation that could emerge with a newly appointed <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council in regard to which there is no limitation as to the period of appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this amendment does, in effect- I have a hope that the Government will accept it- is to enable the Attorney-General to keep an eye on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council with a view to graduating the age group of the Council and not letting the whole Council grow old or set in their ideas as one age group in terms of the time of their appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This enables the Attorney-General purely to take action if he sees fit when a member of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council becomes disinterested and does not carry out his work to the general satisfaction of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any statement or report that proceedings have been instituted in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or in another court exercising jurisdiction under this Act; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(145)  (Mr Ellicott)-  In sub-clause (1), paragraphs (a) and (b), omit ‘in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court or in another’ (twice occurring), substitute ‘in any’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like either the clause to be removed from the Bill or the AttorneyGeneral to give an assurance that, before producing a Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act- I believe that will be in the not too distant future- he will have a good look at this clause in order to ensure that some restraint is placed upon the capacity of the Attorney-General and that in all reasonable cases proceedings shall not be commenced without the approval of the Attorney-General himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill a document, circulated not only within my electorate but in other areas, was put out by the Divorce Law Reform Association and was authorised by  Mr W.  Thompson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document is headed: ‘<span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill in Grave Danger’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is grave danger that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill at present before Parliament will fail or be rendered ineffective by a small but powerful section of Church hierarchy aided by vested legal interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill - which has just been agreed to by the Committee and in the second reading stages in this House- is a memorable Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is path-breaking in the sense that it introduces liberal principles into <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also express my thanks to  Mr Gordon  Yuill, First Assistant-Secretary of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division of the Attorney-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank Professor Finlay, the Assistant Professor of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law at Monash University too, for the help he has given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill is about to pass through this House I should like to pay my respects to the  Chairman  of Committees  (Mr Berinson)  who did a remarkable job, and the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  who had to sit through the whole debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because an Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> suffers a loss he says: ‘Let them bear it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This device prevented us debating matters like this during the currency of the debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in those other industries there is not the predominance of individual <span class="highlight">family</span> operations that there is in agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those productive units represent not just an enterprise in which finance is involved; but there is an involvement of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and an involvement of labour and capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in agriculture it is not only those general applications of policy which penalise the farmer but also those things which have been specifically introduced by the Labor Government and which make it almost impossible for the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How generous of this Government to provide $30m to try to offset the diabolical state in which the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer in Australia has been pressed because of direct Labor Government intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That must be done if the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer is to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not hear this philosophy on the part of the National Country Party about how it protects the small <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer as, under the former Administration, we saw the greatest exodus of small resident bona fide <span class="highlight">family</span> farmers leaving primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me illustrate just how much inflation is damaging the Australian farmer, how much it is damaging his <span class="highlight">family</span> and how much it is damaging the communities in which farmers live and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This not only affects those who are age pensioners; it also has a particular bearing on many families where the children of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are supported by a widow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill has an almost identical clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret any instance of distress caused to the <span class="highlight">family</span> but, on the other hand, if the <span class="highlight">family</span> had advised the child endowment section of the Department of Social Security of the change of name, prompt action could have been taken to change the records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the vast majority of people whom I have contacted are very anxious to return to Darwin and to resume normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people would get around some country towns more, instead of going home at the weekend to the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm or estate or latifundio, they would find that the people in country towns are very grateful indeed for the RED employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had it not been for those requirements, some changes to the Bill would have been made now to take account of the creation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">family</span> law there will be the choice between establishing special procedures, with judges specially selected for their aptitude for and interest in this field of law, or of leaving the administration of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> law to the vagaries of 8 different systems of courts, only some of which have begun to move towards specialised <span class="highlight">family</span> law procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parliament has already recognised this by agreeing to the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This zone is intended primarily to accommodate single <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings on individual allotments and semidetached dwelling houses, but certain parts of the zone may be considered for the erection of rows of houses or residential flat buildings of medium density. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of a good superannuation scheme is to allow employees, after a full career, to maintain their personal and immediate <span class="highlight">family</span>’s standard of living on retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who, because of financial commitments, illness in the <span class="highlight">family</span> or for other factors beyond their control, cannot afford to take advantage of the scheme in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> circumstances, young children, sport activities and livelihood, as with a farmer, for instance are the main determinants of these opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recognise the presence of problems with young house-bound mothers, with a lack of <span class="highlight">family</span> activity and with the lowering age of death among our male population through heart disease- in many cases the result of overweight and stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These centres should cater for <span class="highlight">family</span> activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was also the Nunawading City <span class="highlight">Family</span> Day Care service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned for the complete well-being of the child in the <span class="highlight">family</span> context, in the child care centre and in the general care role as well as, importantly, in the area of that child ‘s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I started to say how concerned I was for the future of young people buying their own properties, buying their own homes, trying to establish a <span class="highlight">family</span> and trying to establish their dream homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For instance, Medibank need not affect the existing relationship between you and your <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate for medical insurance is $1.96 per week, you can save eight or nine times $ 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that they are trying to get $1.86 a week per <span class="highlight">family</span> in the case of New South Wales and higher amounts in some other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a contribution to the coffers of the funds and it will amount to nearly $2 per week per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not, of course, refer to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which has recently passed this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not refer to the fact that a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court has been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, when a patient comes to a doctor who is hard pressed- there is a worldwide shortage particularly of <span class="highlight">family</span> doctors at the moment- the doctor often gives in to the patient’s suggestion that he needs some chemical relief from his problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will be aware that separate cards are not being issued for each child in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was considered to be more convenient for parents for their children’s names and numbers to be on a single <span class="highlight">family</span> card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to achieve the objective of recommendation 2 of the Privacy Committee that each child in a <span class="highlight">family</span> should have his or her own card, the Bill requires in clause 3 that the Commission issue a card to an eligible person upon the request of the person who, of course, may be a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could amend the Constitution to enable justices, judges and magistrates to be appointed to a limited age, to enable specialist judges to be appointed, for instance for a <span class="highlight">family</span> court, to a specific age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within this system there could be courts to deal with special matters- for instance, <span class="highlight">family</span> law, patents and the like- which may require the activities of specialist judges, but all in a courts system which gets rid of this bedevilling situation of a division between State and Federal jurisdiction and between State and Federal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the only objections he has to this Bill are that it still refers to the Matrimonial Causes Act which will be replaced by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, or the fact that the salaries are now inadequate, appropriate amendments could be moved in the Senate which the Government would accept, but he is not wanting amendments to be made to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The case for the Superior Court is now even further strengthened by the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These remarks apply to all businesses but particularly to small and medium sized ones and I have in mind the small <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses which have been the very basis of the tourist industry in South Australia and the very basis of the production of quality wines emanating from that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bureau of Agricultural Economics occasional paper gives us an index of the money which is left to a beef producer to pay for his <span class="highlight">family</span> to live, to service his debt, to replace capital equipment which is worn out and for any expansion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an industry which has served the nation well, consisting to a far greater degree perhaps than other sectors of agriculture of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even there the straits in which those dairy farmers find themselves through the removal of the stabilisation assistance and the difficulties which might have flowed from the possible breakdown of equalisation, all might well have prejudiced the survival of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Coombs report was one of those reports which ignored the role of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer and the capability of a man, such as a dairy farmer, who has for so long made a worthwhile contribution to export and a worthwhile contribution to regional settlement and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, the culprit on being convicted could be declared an outlaw and then become fair game for everybody or, secondly, a fine could be imposed on the culprit’s <span class="highlight">family</span> to be paid to the victim’s <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent violence between the families a neutral person was needed to collect the fine from the culprit’s <span class="highlight">family</span> and give it to the victim’s <span class="highlight">family</span> This person became the ombudsman, meaning the person or the messenger collecting the fine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Lindeman <span class="highlight">family</span> is very very careful about environmental considerations, but in more recent times, in some of the other resorts, it has been obvious when one has looked at the area that not enough care has been given, and these are matters that are going to require considerable care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to the increase in actual benefits the means test applicable to the Additional Boarding Allowance and Special Supplementary Allowance components of the Scheme have been progressively relaxed each year of the Scheme ‘s operation so that all or part of the benefits under these allowances are now available at much higher levels of <span class="highlight">family</span> income than in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-75-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the record of his public life and his political career has been placed before the House this afternoon, many of us will remember him principally as a <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House will long remember Bert Milliner not only as a colleague, whether in Government or in Opposition, but also as a fine <span class="highlight">family</span> man, a good citizen and a fine friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spent many very happy hours with him and with his <span class="highlight">family</span>, arguing over a great variety of things; but right throughout such arguments 2 qualities always emerged- a powerful, unfailing sense of humanity and a quite unwavering sense of humour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As one who was present and, I am sure, like the Prime Minister and so many others, particularly  Senator Milliner’s  <span class="highlight">family</span>, I was disgusted to see how the filming of those events was used, particularly by Channel 2 in its television program that evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall the passing of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill through this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a section in it, section 41, that requires me to confer with the various State Attorneys on the subject to give them the option of setting up <span class="highlight">family</span> courts within the various States of the Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter has been the subject of correspondence, and I can tell the House now that I have been informed by the Attorneys in each of the States, other than Western Australia, that they do not wish to set up a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in their States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New South Wales and Victoria were fairly early off the mark, but I was informed by the Minister for Justice in Queensland only a week or 10 days ago that Queensland does not wish to set up a <span class="highlight">family</span> court in Queensland but would prefer the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia to operate there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McNeill  in Western Australia has told me that he prefers to set up a <span class="highlight">family</span> court of Western Australia, and no doubt that will be done in due course there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am happy to tell the House now that the date when we hope to have, or will have, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act operating is 5 January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government stands firmly committed to the proposition of there being an Australian Legal Aid Office although the Government recognises that at this stage the Office has no legislative context or background, save for, I think, reference in some Acts, particularly the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he say what the taxpayer in question, a <span class="highlight">family</span> man, has gained as a result not only of current Budget measures but also of earlier tax cuts and the introduction of Medibank? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, depending on the size of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, that level is adjusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A single wage <span class="highlight">family</span> with dependent children will overwhelmingly be much better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, he could easily have pointed out that if a taxpayer has a working wife, between them they will be paying less tax on their aggregate income than a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a single income of the same order, but they will be paying more tax than they would be paying under the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a program that supports the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that other costs to come in almost immediately from the Budget, such as petrol, beer, cigarettes, postage and telephone charges, will in fact disadvantage the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man that he keeps talking about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The cost of attempting to match by clerical methods the individual card sent to the mother in her own right with that sent to her as a <span class="highlight">family</span> card would have far exceeded the cost of sending the cards out by high speed machine operation in different envelopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it sense to exempt these single people from tax obligations at a time when the <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinner with a spouse and 2 children who is earning $135 a week which will be inflated to $ 1 63 by the end of the year which will result in an additional $490 tax payment- nearly doubling his tax- is being slugged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new tax system substantially lowers the tax burden on the lower and middle income <span class="highlight">family</span> man and exempts 500 000 current taxpayers from paying any tax at all because it will lift substantially minimum taxable income levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They say that the plan provides great tax benefits to the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with 3 children or more and that it is an invitation or acts as a direct inducement to parents with 2 children or more to go on and to ‘proliferate with a vengeance’ as they put it, with a third, fourth, fifth or sixth child and so on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is to achieve a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation borne by individual taxpayers, especially the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, I find it anomalous that the Commonwealth should have a power in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters covering divorce, property rights arising out of divorce situations, marriage and so forth, whereas the States retain legal responsibility for such matters as legitimacy and adoption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of that number 35.5 per cent were in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area; 24 per cent were concerned with problems related to Federal law; 21.5 per cent were conducted with pensioners and 8 per cent with migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall the enactment on a free vote on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill that went through this Parliament a little while ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would certainly seriously impinge on the operation of that Act and the coming into being of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 and the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1 973- 1 975 to provide for increases in the salaries and allowances of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is created by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975, which was passed by the Parliament earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates of salaries and allowances forjudges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which are prescribed by the Act in accordance with constitutional requirements, have fallen behind the rates for judges of Federal courts of comparable status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This occurred largely because the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill occupied so much of the time of both Houses before it was finally passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will see in the Schedule to the Bill, the rates recommended for the Chief Judge and for Senior Judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are equivalent to the rates for the Chief Judge and Judges respectively of the Australian Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The salaries of other judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have been increased proportionately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of the wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the status, and therefore the salaries, of judges of the Court must be made such as to attract persons of a high calibre to the Bench of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to have a policy of putting 16 people in a house with only three or four bedrooms we can expect only that 16 people will make noise which is far in excess of that which a normal <span class="highlight">family</span> of six will make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The land in the Arnhem Land area is comparatively rich and only a relatively small area is needed for the support of a <span class="highlight">family</span> or a clan; but in the centre of Australia the land is very poor and barren and many square miles- tens or hundreds of square miles- are needed for the support of even a single <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for people like  Mr Stone  and other senior public servants earning well over $25,000 a year to come along and tell the Government that it ought to put the screws on the man who has to keep a wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> on less than $160 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will get a darn sight less if the Government is allowed to dismantle the whole wage indexation policy and revert to taking unilateral decisions in the Cabinet room as to what the wages of workers in this country should be, relying only on the advice of the Treasury, in its ivory tower, which has no contact with the average Australian person, the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some State judges seem to be troubled by the section of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that requires them not to wear robes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I also direct the attention of honourable members to a rather more serious matter, namely, the fact that the general validity of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is now in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of a question that was raised in South Australia- I think in a case relating to custody with no associated divorce proceedings- section 40A of the Judiciary Act has operated to cause a question as to the validity of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to be before the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is, of course, that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is to that extent under question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the High Court was to declare the Act wholly or largely invalid there would be serious consequences both from the point of view of the administration of the Act in its extent and from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in accordance with section 41 of that Act, did attempt to get the State governments to set up State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts under section 41 by arrangement with the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that the Government is proceeding to appoint further <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court judges to take up the work of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court as it proceeds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that statement perhaps not in direct answer to the question but to indicate to honourable members that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and its administration are constantly under review but the Act is also under review in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time it is estimated that the extra cost to contributors of these organisations will be small- in the region of 10 to 12 cents per week <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it is desirable for a working man and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to be able to move outwards to the closest suburbs without having to go miles and miles outside the metropolitan area from whence they would have to commute at expense and difficulty, and when the schools, hospitals and pre-existing amenities in an area such as St George would not be used because there would be fewer children and fewer people in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the most part they are very frightened people, people who have lived in daily fear of deportation, hiding their identity from their employers, afraid to communicate with their <span class="highlight">family</span> and friends, moving from house to house for fear of detection, a prey to the exploiters and manipulators in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only possible for a large number of farmers to follow that occupation because of the involvement of their <span class="highlight">family</span> in farm work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That felicitous collocation of words tumbled from the honourable gentleman only a few weeks ago, indeed asserting the <span class="highlight">family</span> motto- modesty above aU. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in my possession a letter written in 1 888 by a member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> from the then booming cattle and mining town of Croydon, in the centre of the gulf country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What of the <span class="highlight">family</span> with one or more members suffering from chronic illness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, take the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> which has 2 children suffering from a chronic illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> with such patients would be required to purchase 8 items at $2 a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the <span class="highlight">family</span> has to pay $16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a <span class="highlight">family</span> could be up for another $10 to $12 in a week to 10 da) s’ time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that those cents were taken out of the dollar and money was given back to the people in the form of pensions, payments, repatriation, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and so on so that they could spend it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her  part of the bargain was to encourage her ghastly ALP supporting <span class="highlight">family</span> to take down their pro- Labor signs and to vote for the Liberal candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, not counting the cases in other electorates- only three of which are public knowledge- in my own electorate there was: Firstly the offer of money to a prospective Independent candidate if he would direct his preferences to the Liberals; secondly, there was the offer of money and a holiday in return for retraction of a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s political affiliations; and thirdly, when all else failed there was the ultimate weapon, a death threat to an old man who unashamedly supports my return to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the proper conduct of forestry operations in country areas keeps the ordinary worker and his <span class="highlight">family</span> in those country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are told that for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to be eligible for a maximum grant under this scheme it must save at least $26 per week for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be an Australia that tolerates different lifestyles and the pursuit of an individual’s and a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s own happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was discovered by the Wedge <span class="highlight">family</span> and eventually became the most important cattle market for the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change appears in attitudes towards the church, the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the army, the factory - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of families who are very well off and still claim these special allowances simply because they have some small amount of Aboriginal blood in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, even though they own large properties or have high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many honourable members of this House are associated with or know of genuine hard working community groups in their electorates which are seeking to raise funds to provide a kindergarten, a preschool centre, a child care centre, a play group or some other form of <span class="highlight">family</span> day assistance only to find that $500 raised the year before last will purchase this year only the equivalent of $300 worth of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at the matter of child care services and pre-school education it is terribly important that as a nation and as a government we should have a philosophy relating to the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much of its legislation put on the <span class="highlight">family</span> pressures that created a need for child care services where families were previously able to provide and wished still to provide those services for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are, firstly, the Government’s undertaking to protect individuals from unlegislated tax increases; secondly, its undertaking to take account of the special problems of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>; and, thirdly, its undertaking to move towards a replacement of the means test with an income test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At some later stage I will havemore to say on the effect of this concept of tax forgone, but I want to turn now to the problems of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister gave the undertaking in his policy speech that a Liberal-National Country Party government would reform the tax structure to take account of the special problems of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been so despite the fact that for the majority of Australians it is the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit which is the real decision making consumption unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our tax system increases these inequalities by imposing a tax burden on the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> which is significantly higher than that imposed on the 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> with the same <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to act on the recommendations of a majority of the Asprey Committee and to submit for public examination and discussion an optional <span class="highlight">family</span> unit system of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should not be frightened off by the scaremongers who peddle misconceptions about the use of the <span class="highlight">family</span> rather than the individual as a unit of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of ways to assess the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit for tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imposition of tax on aggregate <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes is not the only method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is done in the United Kingdom but there most families pay less tax than they would had the spouses been taxed separately because the rebates available to those taxed separately on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit are not otherwise available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many other variations, such as the definition of <span class="highlight">family</span> incomethe division of <span class="highlight">family</span> income by a factor which takes account of the number of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I urge the Government, as a matter of urgency, to do 3 things: Firstly, to fully, not partially, index personal income tax; secondly, to introduce optional <span class="highlight">family</span> unit taxation which permits spouses to be taxed on a partnership basis; and, thirdly, to replace all means tests with an income test integrated with the tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a great number of applications for people to come from the Lebanon and in assessing those applications obviously we must give preference and priority to close <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter that concerns a basicenvironment for young people growing up and a basic environment for young people when they are married and when they are engaged in early <span class="highlight">family</span> formation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To qualify for an average $20,000 loan a <span class="highlight">family</span> will need an income of at least $9,600 per annum- and many of them do not have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, leads to a lack of pride on the part of the individual and a lack of pride in his <span class="highlight">family</span> which, quite often, is reflected in the children of that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally might I say that I believe that our <span class="highlight">family</span> life, when it takes place in a home owned by the <span class="highlight">family</span>, stands our nation in good stead for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were that much richer, or perhaps we were in exactly the same position because we transferred our cash into a fixed asset, but the <span class="highlight">family</span> was no richer or poorer for the transaction that took place, except that we now had the use of a motor car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those places are unsuitable for the people because the <span class="highlight">family</span> must have children before it can be provided with accommodation by the Victorian Housing Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No wonder those on the application list for <span class="highlight">family</span> accommodation in Queensland as at 29 February totalled 6,490. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I must say that I feel that it is more than just a matter of philosophy, because I am certain that honourable members opposite would accept the point of view that I now put, namely, that it must be the basic and inalienable right of every Australian and his <span class="highlight">family</span> not only to own a piece of his native land but also to have the security of knowing that the dwelling in which he lives is his for life and can be passed on after his life to those members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> who may be in a position to occupy it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly I think it is completely wrong and untenable that a person who goes into a home in accordance with a tenancy agreement and then wishes to become the purchaser, having improved that home and having tried to build it up and make it attractive for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, finds that as his income has increased from the time he first became a tenant he is ineligible to become a purchaser because of the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decline in the number of births recorded in Australia in each year since 197 1 is now generally accepted as the continuation of a longstanding decline in <span class="highlight">family</span> size, not so clearly evident before 1971 because of the intervention of such factors as soaring rates of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the heady days when we were being bashed by the present Government in an election campaign, under circumstances that would not bear repeating, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  promised that there would be no Gold Coast holidays on the <span class="highlight">family</span> earnings of Australians, no Gold Coast holidays for anyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke to his predecessor, who advised me that the arrangement was that under the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act the Australian Government was to fund the State governments to employ special officers in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to handle enforcement orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the complications of the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act- the protection is much greater than under the old Matrimonial Causes Act but the new Act is much more complicated and accordingly needs qualified legal opinion and legal assistance for interpretation- such a woman who may be on a deserted wife’s pension, for example will be forced to go to a private solicitor and pay $120 to protect her legal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governor-General for political reasons- and not only against him, but against members of bis <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its vocational training and reorientation courses, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program, sponsored by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, provides extensive instruction on early detection, intervention and rehabilitation with respect to alcoholism, drug addiction and the problems of handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I know that, in its implementation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Medicine Program, the College shares the Government’s concern in these areas and, in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> medical practice, has always sought to emphasise the importance of early detection, treatment and rehabilitation in relation to these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is even more of a strain when the individual concerned is the head of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has previously looked to this individual as the breadwinner, the head of the household. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children where both husband and wife are pensioners, instead of what is a reasonable expectation in the circumstances at the present time that they will get an addition of $1 a week to their pension income as the adjustment in the dependants’ allowance because of the 6.4 per cent increase in the consumer price index, which seems to have flowed to every other sector in the economy, they are going to get nothing- not even cold comfort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe I will get more support from the newer members in this House in November, especially after they have had the experience of almost all the older members of having to lend a widow or deserted wife $20 on a Friday afternoon, so that she can buy the groceries for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, until her pension cheque arrives some weeks later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about these sums in <span class="highlight">family</span> budgets, that amount of money can be substantial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the changing pattern of single income and two-income families in themselves must throw into some doubt the adequacy in the future- in 10, 15 or 20 years time- of merely adjusting pensions against the income of one of a two-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision is brought forward into section 56 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law debate one of the things about which we were basically concerned was the privacy of divorce proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that under the 1973-74 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement which was introduced by the former Labor Government no more than 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">family</span> dwellings built after 1 January 1974 may be sold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say a word this morning about the <span class="highlight">family</span>, from whose stable environment most of us have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prompted to speak on the <span class="highlight">family</span> this morning because there are good <span class="highlight">family</span> men on the other side as well as on this side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another reason why I am speaking about it is that I believe there has been an overconcentration by all forms of the media in this country on the rather odd situations that substitute for <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the thing that concerns me more than anything else is that these odd situations might become more accepted as the norm in this country at the expense of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the third reason I am speaking about this matter is that, having read with very great interest the splendid first speech made by  Senator Shirley  Walters in the other place, I felt that it was about time that somebody in this House drew the same sort of attention that she did to the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not so long ago that it was unheard of for anyone to speak ill of motherhood or of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a variety of attitudes on just what the <span class="highlight">family</span> means and what the role of the mother and the father should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a variety of attitudes to marriage itself and even to whether marriage is necessary to the raising of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the advent of easy divorce, easy contraception and abortion, there is a questioning of the old values and codes of behaviour that bound the <span class="highlight">family</span> together and made it strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I believe we have to fear today is the type of change that is developing in thinking about the fundamental role and integrity of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, unfortunately, in the community a glib and vociferous minority which aims at destroying the fundamental <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and replacing it not with anything demonstrably stronger but with alternatives that raise serious doubts about their long-term and short-term consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is the natural and fundamental group-unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is a cohesive force in society and the Liberal Party recognises the necessity for strengthening its influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation makes the every day balancing of the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget a heartbreaking impossibility without the added income from a mother’s earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of direct and indirect taxation also falls heavily on the <span class="highlight">family</span> and undoubtedly is one factor in forcing women out to work, even though this adds to the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s overall tax bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge this Government to do everything it can to lessen the burden of direct and indirect taxes on the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect of taxation is often overlooked, I believe, when considering the stability of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic unit of a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Granted, these people pay taxes but if their demands are met to the full the rest of the community, including the <span class="highlight">family</span> where the mother remains at home, must cany part of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is therefore injustice and a species of insanity in a situation where the <span class="highlight">family</span> must bear a share of the cost of the consequences of a lifestyle which inherently is at war with the <span class="highlight">family</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a moral but a social question to determine spending priorities and I urge the Government to look closely and carefully at its priorities so that it not only does nothing to penalise the <span class="highlight">family</span> but actually encourages its growth and strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberals acknowledge the vital contribution of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in the development of the individual and, if the <span class="highlight">family</span> is having difficulty fulfilling that task, the community must come to its aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context the Government is the community and I urge the Government to do all it can to encourage women back into the home so the <span class="highlight">family</span> is not deprived of its heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same arrogant, inhumane and elitist attitude which says that if a young person from a poor <span class="highlight">family</span>, without assets, wants to look around for agreeable work with good prospects and is on unemployment benefits then he is a bludger, also says that if another young chap with assets who can live with his <span class="highlight">family</span> for a while does the same thing, then society admires him and describes what he is doing as looking for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have arranged their <span class="highlight">family</span> concerns to retire at that age and to do what they chose to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pensioners in my <span class="highlight">family</span> and I am proud of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen members of my <span class="highlight">family</span> suffer because of the disease called inflation; I have seen them suffer because of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put this to the Minister: If, for instance, a person has lost his father, if a <span class="highlight">family</span> has lost its home, or if a woman has lost her husband, does he seriously say that that does not come within the ambit of special circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second question, I am now able to tell the House that last month, when questions concerning the divorce case were raised in the New South Wales Parliament, an officer of my Department raised the matter in a telephone call to the Registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did so on his own initiative purely for the purpose of clarifying certain details in anticipation of having to brief me on the case, having regard to my responsibilities under the Matrimonial Causes Act and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes, as the House is already aware, will enable women to preserve superannuation benefits while their careers are interrupted for such reasons as raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is contrary to the socially desirable ideal of a 2 parent <span class="highlight">family</span> being a better <span class="highlight">family</span> in which to bring up children than perhaps a one parent <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise in Australia that when we talk about re-location of resources we are talking about placing an extra burden on an individual or a <span class="highlight">family</span> to seek different employment in another region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first requirement is very positive consideration of whether in the foreseeable future we will have partly produced in this country what might properly be described as a <span class="highlight">family</span> car, the cost of which will be kept within the reach of the average Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any ordinary citizen who shoulders the responsibility for his <span class="highlight">family</span> of maintaining a motor vehicle- in these days life is impossible without one- has constantly in mind the capital outlay, the depreciation and the maintenance of that vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the difficulty seems to have arisen because 3 manufacturers in Australia- the Ford Motor Co of Australia, General MotorsHolden’s Pty Ltd and Chrysler Australia Ltdhave been hell bent on building 6-cylinder motor vehicles that would normally be called <span class="highlight">family</span> cars, when clearly the consumer was looking for something other than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> earning an average income can improve the income at its disposal by as much as one third during its lifetime by buying its own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> cannot buy its own home, then capital gains, rentals and tax concessions derived from ownership go to the landlords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These high early repayments fall harshly on the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way the raising of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and the establishment of lives securely based in a <span class="highlight">family</span> home comes about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who travels around the nursing homes and the aged people’s homes of this country will see in them many people whose only asset that put them in a place where they could be cared for was their <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our basic policy objectives seek to ensure that every <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay-and that is the key. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both increases have meant that in the initial years of paying off a housing loan it required a greater proportion of the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s income than it did 10 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, for the average one-income <span class="highlight">family</span> in Sydney in early 1974, about 42 per cent of income was required to meet first year mortgage repayments as opposed to 3 1 per cent in 1 963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is applicable to all sections of our society, from the young <span class="highlight">family</span> to the older families, from single people to married people, and it is applicable to all permanent residents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tables on pages 1 7 and 1 8 clearly show that the children of the lower paid worker or the lower income <span class="highlight">family</span> are not completing a secondary education and are certainly not even achieving entrance qualifications to the tertiary field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It runs a <span class="highlight">family</span> day care program, for which it received $6,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> day care program requires only the rather small amount of $6,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way a link could be forged between school, <span class="highlight">family</span>, peer group, and the society at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am the only Australian born member of my <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the economic factors which have contributed to the decreasing <span class="highlight">family</span> size? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> unity, growth centres, welfare and other requirements, representations on bodies that affect the welfare of their own future and representations throughout the occupational structures that give a voice to the individuals are some of the matters to which I make reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the amendments to the maintenance sections of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act come before the Parliament will members of the Government parties be given a free vote, as all members were given when the Bill for that Act came before both Houses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the predominance of people- people rearing young families and incurring <span class="highlight">family</span> costs- are going to lose the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is said in the country that it takes 3 generations for a <span class="highlight">family</span> to build a property and to lose a property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular publicity component during 1973-74 was directed at the smoker who was the breadwinner; who by age was at a higher risk and who, if prematurely deceased would leave a significant gap within a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I have said, and what the Treasurer and the Government have said, is that people should have confidence in the future to undertake their normal budgetary programs on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make no apology for the fact that he, together with 21 other people, happens to be a partner of my brother in a legal firm in Sydney, just as I would not have criticised the appointment of  Mr Justice  Dovey to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court if that appointment had been made by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was in recognition of this need that the Parliament legislated for the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that the serious shortage of judges with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is slowing its proceedings very markedly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am constantly in touch with the position in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and I am concerned, as I think most honourable members are concerned, at the fact that the number of applications for divorce filed this year is running at three to four times the comparative rate for last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One explanation of this may be that there is a backlog of people who were waiting for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to come into force, but one would have thought that by this stage that rate would have declined somewhat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will also be aware that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act itself is under challenge in the High Court of Australia and that the decision of the High Court has been reserved and has not yet been handed down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this not mean that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts will be required to set higher maintenance orders, with a resultant increase in both defaults and the costs to supporting mothers of enforcing maintenance orders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a section of grazing industries but in Tasmania our rural industries largely are based on small <span class="highlight">family</span> farms, mainly dairies and orchards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most honourable members would be aware, at the moment those small <span class="highlight">family</span> farms are in a very bad economic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a nursing home bed is not needed these people should be looked after in their own homes in their <span class="highlight">family</span> environment with a greater provision of support services for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They should be allowed to develop a <span class="highlight">family</span> life in those areas without the necessity of having to commute very great distances to make use of hospitals, schools and the like which are already built in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he take steps to see that orders made under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are complied with? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had a look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> law regulations and discoveredhonourable members will perhaps recall this- that the provisions for the enforcement of maintenance orders prescribe a series of alternatives for deserted wives with defaulting husbands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that procedure was set aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas they had done that in the past they would not do it under the <span class="highlight">family</span> law regulations because a choice had to be made as to whether the wife would apply for, say, an order for seizure, an order for sequestration or the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that questioning the magistrate will be able to make one or other of the orders that are set out in the regulations under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that it costs the Federal Government, a State government and a local council less money to settle a <span class="highlight">family</span> in a designated growth centre than it costs each of those bodies to settle a <span class="highlight">family</span> in any capital city in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if the employee carried personal assurance of, say, $20,000, that sum would be deducted from the $30,000 available to the employee’s <span class="highlight">family</span> in the event of death, and the Government would provide $10,000 only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last thing I want to say,  Mr Speaker,  is that whilst the Leader of the Opposition is taking his 6 weeks’ jaunt overseas, as I read in the newspapers he is about to take, he might at least have the decency when he is out of the country to reflect on the situation that affects the Paltridge <span class="highlight">family</span> and to send them a cable apologising for the whole of his actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The biographer whom he quoted so approvingly here during the last week in which we sat has pointed out in the same work that the Prime Minister has quoted how, earlier as a Minister, the Prime Minister gave ‘Nareen’ as his home address so that he could gather the daily ministerial travelling allowance for residing with his <span class="highlight">family</span> at his permanent home address in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people now find that under the means test they cannot undertake contested matters, particularly in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law field, because they cannot afford the legal costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such charity is all the less likely to be extended having regard to the more limited opportunity to recover costs under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act than was available under earlier legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, following these changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act it became obvious to many of us that even with this major advance many <span class="highlight">family</span> owned wine making companies and some private and public wine making companies would still be in an extremely tight liquidity situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for increases in the salaries and allowances of Judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates of salaries and allowances for Judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which are at present prescribed in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975, have fallen behind the rates for Judges of other Federal courts of comparable status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has occurred largely because the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill occupied so much of the time of both Houses during its passage through Parliament last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates proposed for the Chief Judge and for Senior Judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are equivalent to the rates for the Chief Judge and Judges respectively of the Australian Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed rate for ordinary Judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- at which level the majority of Judges are being appointedis $5,000 less than that for Senior Judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the proposed increases were to have been made before the commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and appointments to the Court have been offered and accepted on this basis, the Bill now before the House provides for the increases to be retrospective to 5 January 1976, the date of commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after the House has agreed on further debate on this Bill, I propose to introduce a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill to make a number of amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is the establishment of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has replaced the old divorce, maintenance, custody and property laws contained in the Matrimonial Causes Act and to some extent in State and Territory legislation, and that it came into operation on 5 January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further regrettable consequence of the decision as to the limits of jurisdiction under the Act is that the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, a Federal court created by the Act, is limited to the same degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that a person who has taken proceedings under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, only to find that his case is beyond the limits of the jurisdiction under the Act, would have to start again in the appropriate State court under the relevant State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen that the High Court decision has meant that the concept of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court able to deal with all matters relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law cannot be realised under a law of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under present constitutional limitations, this concept can be realised only through a system of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts exercising State and federal jurisdiction covering the whole area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as custody is concerned, the problem of the disputes beyond the reach of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is part of a wider need for uniform State and Territory laws as to custody, including custody and rights of ex-nuptial children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore propose to suggest to the States that they consider introducing complementary legislation as to the closing of their courts when exercising jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the jurisdiction of the State supreme courts under the Act will be terminated in the near future- at the request of the States- I expect State courts of summary jurisdiction to continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court for some time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, section 97 will remain unaltered, so that proceedings before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia will continue to be in closed court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One category comprises amendments included to ensure that State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts established pursuant to section 41 of the Act can operate on the same basis as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the grafting-on of the provisions for State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill during its passage through Parliament, a few oversights and omissions occurred which this Bill seeks to remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Bill provides for transfers of proceedings from a Supreme Court to a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in the same way as the Act now provides for transfers to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After Western Australia decided to establish its State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, it became apparent that it would be preferable for the Court to have its own counselling staff rather than use that of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, as envisaged by section 41 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment will correspond to section 106 (b) of the Act, which was sponsored by the right honourable member for Lowe when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was in this House, and which enables proceedings for enforcement of maintenance orders to be taken on behalf of persons entitled to moneys under them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By an oversight when the original Bill was being amended during its passage through Parliament, provision was not included to enable appeals to be taken from Territory Supreme Courts to the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, which is the court of appeal from State Supreme Courts under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To facilitate the determination of questions of law by the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, a provision has been inserted to enable such questions that arise in any proceedings before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to be referred by way of a case stated procedure to the Full Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decisions I will announce shortly relate to expenditure restraint, Medibank, a new scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and personal tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other programs the Cabinet reviewed the <span class="highlight">family</span> law and legal aid programs administered by the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The comparatively new program of <span class="highlight">family</span> law will be continued with a budget of $ 10.4m for 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the funds to be made available, the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies is to be established during the course of 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things, this expanded program will facilitate <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To help offset the cost of the assisted passages, we have decided to increase the contributions from migrants receiving assistance under the scheme by $50 to $200 in the case of single migrants, and by $ 150 to $300 in the case of <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The annual cost of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme in a full year is almost exactly the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The income tax rates scale will be indexed and so also will the rebates for a dependent spouse or a housekeeper, the sole parent rebate and the $540 basic rebate; because of our decision in relation to the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the question of indexing the existing children’s rebates will not now arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures make it not only possible but also desirable to introduce the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme and our tax indexation measures in 1 976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although, as I shall refer to later, the Government’s new proposals for better and fairer <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances entails the withdrawal of tax rebates for children, this will not exclude them from the basis for calculation of the zone allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken elsewhere of the Government’s proposals for an improved scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and pointed out the reasons for the consequential removal of the rebates for maintenance of children from the income tax law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is anticipated that the arrangement for people to contribute to the Commission will provide an effective ceiling on levy payments of about $ 1 50 a year for a person without dependants and about $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, it is estimated that the combined contribution rates for the standard tables will be of the order of$175 a year-$3.35 a week-at the single rate and $350 a year-$6.70 a week- at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of this additional cover is estimated at $135 a year-or $2.60 a week- at a <span class="highlight">family</span> rate and would be payable in addition to the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a guide, annual contribution rates to Medibank are expected to be about $ 1 50 a year for a person without dependants and about $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who are receiving <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances when the new rates come into operation will not need to apply to receive the higher payments, but claims will need to be lodged by those who will become eligible to receive payments under the new eligibility conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For such families they will more than offset any reduction in assistance for children arising from the substitution of increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will take effect at virtually the same time as the pay-as-you-earn schedules of tax instalments are adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as the major point of the honourable gentleman’s question is concerned, that is to say the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the major increase in child endowment, if I may say so,  Mr Speaker,  that is one of the most significant measures of social welfare introduced in this country by any government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope they will show sufficient concern for their own electors, many of whom will want to know the specific choices available to them and to be able to relate those choices to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income and circumstances and their predilections for the kind of health care that they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to such things as the cancellation of the rebate for dependants and its replacement with a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance or increased child endowment payments; the disbanding of Medibank and the forced return of people to the private health insurance funds, with a slug to taxpayers to pay for it; and income tax indexation as a trade-off to the Medibank tax or the Medibank levy- call it what you will, because it is one and the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the dependants’ rebate and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in terms of dollars and cents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why did the Government decide to take away the rebate for dependent children and turn it into a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance or an increase in the child endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason to believe that the money will necessarily be spent, although it is true to say that the breadwinner of the <span class="highlight">family</span> will receive a reduced pay packet because the dependant’s allowance which was made available to him each week under the rebate system introduced in the last Labor Budget has been taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other is to bring about greater wage justice and social benefits by the introduction of tax indexation and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in the desire that there will be greater wage restraint on the part of the ordinary men and women of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change from child endowment to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, together with the abolition of the tax rebates for dependent children, will bring very great benefits to low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the basic change now to be made with the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances at a much higher rate than the previous child endowment will prove to be of major assistance to many of these low income farm families about which I have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why has it not extended the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunification program to include brothers and sisters of the permanent residents in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I call on the Minister to give the House an unqualified assurance that this new quota will not discriminate against the non-British migrant, that every person living in Australia will have an equal opportunity to nominate members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> as permanent settlers, an unqualified assurance that eligibility under this new quota will in no way be influenced by the country of origin of the persons applying to migrate to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) and especially the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances proposals, which have been overlooked by honourable members opposite during the course of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context it is of great significance, in relation to the Government’s decision to use the vehicle of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to direct resources away from the relatively well off to the poor, that the report showed quite clearly that the group of people in the community whose incomes fall below the poverty line by the biggest percentage were in large families whose fathers were earning the minimum wage or a little more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  and the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  earlier in this debate, when summing up their comments on these proposals, would not acknowledge the benefits of income redistribution which accrue from the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances the Government is giving recognition to all parents of the extra responsibilities they carry, not merely to the taxpayers amongst them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always felt that this was an abuse of scarce government resources, particularly when there were many poor families who needed much more in the way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to provide better food, clothing and other basic or essential items for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances now will be felt more by those who need them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have alluded already to the fact that by redistributing the benefits of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to the poorer families this money will be spent on more essential items for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances plan obviously, therefore, has a dual benefit for the country: Firstly, it introduces a very real measure of social justice into our welfare system and, secondly, together with the impact of” personal income tax indexation, it will redirect resources to people in the community who have a much higher propensity to consume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>A further advantage of the new system is that families will not have to wait until the end of the financial year to receive the benefits of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, as occurred under the tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are ill-founded on the ground of logic and in my opinion they do not reflect a proper understanding of the principles behind the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme will be $ 1,020m in the first year, but $900m of this will be provided by the abolition of the rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our migrant families are a particular group in the community who will benefit very substantially from the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although many migrant mothers might prefer to stay at home and attend to normal motherly duties, many of them are forced by their circumstances to join the work force in order to supplement the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also seen the stress which this has imposed upon their <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing honourable members opposite will have to concede is that the poorest and the weakest members of the Australian community will have their circumstances immediately and substantially improved by the combined <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and tax indexation measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> with whom we equate, I think quite wrongly, budgetary policy, does not pay for its house in the year of purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who thinks that that will make a great deal of difference to <span class="highlight">family</span> expenditure does not know how much control most wives have over their husband’s pay packet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that the child endowment payments in those areas in which the <span class="highlight">family</span> can possibly afford it- if the <span class="highlight">family</span> could not it would be spending its total income anyhow- will remain in the bank to meet especially those commitments to rates and the commitments of that nature that will of necessity increase because the Government has not in this package indicated a sufficient level of support to local government to prevent very substantial increases in costs in that area being passed on to the public this year in the form of municipal rate increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which benefits those worst off families the most is a major advance in social welfare in Australia and is recognised as such by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the last aspect, namely, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances: Again, the provision of these increased allowances represents a complete shift in our social program as to the way in which we place money in the hands of those people who need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to statements that have been made to the effect that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance proposals will benefit the 300 000 families and their 800 000 children throughout Australia who could not take advantage of the previous system of tax deductions for dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see nothing wrong with this because in doing this we have made Medibank pay for itself and we have given an impetus to the people who want the advantage of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, namely, the poor and the disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, if I were an insurer I would much prefer to insure the group of people aged between 16 years, when those people start work, and about 25 years, when they start a <span class="highlight">family</span> than the groups before or after that age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, although the tax tables published show that people will be 7c or 14c better off, I do not think that is terribly important; nonetheless, for every child in the <span class="highlight">family</span> people will really be 5c a week worse off than was shown in the published figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are probably the most far-reaching welfare step taken by any government since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not mention the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not praise the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that every Australian mother will be entitled to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy concerning <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and woman helps such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen that poverty among 2-parent families is related to <span class="highlight">family</span> size . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore welcome the substantial moves in recent years by several States into the provision of more comprehensive <span class="highlight">family</span> and community welfare services . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question whether I have had any allegations or complaints about judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court, I have received one from one honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But may I say that that matter is now the subject of an appeal to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in its appellate jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I refer honourable members to section 97 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that last week there was a somewhat unusual meeting in the sense that members of both sides met and discussed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that were subsequently introduced into this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 97 provides for the proceedings of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, or indeed any court dealing with <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters, to be heard  in camera  subject to regulations and subject to parties, relatives, etc., being present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated then to honourable members that I proposed to talk to the Attorneys-General of the States in relation to this matter to see whether they would apply to State courts under State legislation the principle of section 97 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very significant matter that was referred to me by the Chief Justice of Tasmania was whether contempt proceedings before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be dealt with in open court or in closed court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and other judges have said to me that they believe it would be better if the predominant rule were that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court itself was held in open court as distinct from the principle of section 97. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it is difficult, on taxation principles, to see why a distinction should be made between the provision of maintenance for children in this way and that provided in ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is not simply that the positions have been reversed, because our proposal was for a 1.35 per cent levy on everybody to a maximum, at that stage, $150 premium per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person had some major health problem which required a major operation and he finished up in an intensive care ward, I am sure he would not like to be in a private hospital and he would not like any members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> to be in a private hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cost a married person an estimated $135 a year for the right to select the doctor of his choice for his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members know, the <span class="highlight">family</span> premium cover under Medibank is $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter whether it is the <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor, the specialist, the ear nose and throat specialist, the pediatrician, the obstetrician or a member of that branch of the medical profession that is providing diagnostic services, we all appreciate exactly what is being done by the profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families on higher incomes can, if they so wish, obtain the type of services that the honourable member for Maribyrnong mentioned- the services available in our great public hospitals- and can take out, in approximate terms, a $300 <span class="highlight">family</span> premium or package that will cover them for the cost of treatment in standard wards of public hospitals with hospital staff engaged by the hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> will also be able to recoup 85 per cent of the scheduled medical fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that this service will cost somewhere of the order of $350 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span> or $175 a year for a single person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-A <span class="highlight">family</span> on the $13,000 to $14,000 income level can take out a $300 standard Medibank premium which is very close to cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are married, with a <span class="highlight">family</span> we can either take out a standard Medibank premium of approximately $300 a year or we insure privately for $355 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second question is this: If I apprehend the situation correctly in relation to the premium contribution for Medibank of $300 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> or $350 to opt out and take private health insurance cover for private medical service and intermediate ward accommodation, if contributions to the private funds increaseaccording to my rough estimates from papers which I have kept concerning utilisation rates I calculate that the amount will not be $350 but will be closer to $400- do we have an undertaking that the $300 will not increase? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, in reply to the questions from the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden ) let me say that the approximate $300 premium that was set for a standard Medibank package, as it is called, provides a <span class="highlight">family</span> with standard ward accommodation in a public hospital and also with benefits involving 85 per cent of the scheduled fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not provide a tremendous subsidy to a man or a <span class="highlight">family</span> on a high income and it goes pretty close to covering the cost of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next question relates to the amount of $135 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> or approximately $68 for a single person for hospital only insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about levy payers where the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s total income is about $9,000 net. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At about that point it will pay that <span class="highlight">family</span> to insure privately for medical and hospital attention, but below that point if the <span class="highlight">family</span> wants to exercise the right to ave their own doctor in a hospital in a standard ward accommodation it will pay the <span class="highlight">family</span> to pay the  2Vi  per cent levy on the joint or aggregated income and pay approximately $135 a year- that is our estimate- to a fund to obtain that sort of cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we allowed that situation to occur what we would be asking the levy payers and the lower income people to do would be to subsidise a person who chooses to insure himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> for what he regards to be more comfortable accommodation in a hospital with choice of doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The $300 that a <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay will be fairly close to the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned the way people tend to hero worship their local doctortheir <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme shows the Government’s determination to work in the interests of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a good feature that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances be liberalised and modified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Curtailments will bite into the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning activities, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories expansion program, the fight against tuberculosis which has been waged since 1948 and which has now been slashed by $9m, the school dental scheme and many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s major drive into the areas of poverty through tax indexation and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is almost breathtaking in its magnitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimate of $ 1,020m in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for the ensuing year is clear proof of the Government ‘s sincerity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future every mother will be able to plan for her <span class="highlight">family</span>’s welfare, more confident in the knowledge that a Reserve Bank cheque will be paid direct to her in accordance with the scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children will now receive $20.50 a week under the new scheme as against $5.75 under the old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer of course to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The more vulnerable groups of society- the very young, the sick and the old- were cared for primarily within the <span class="highlight">family</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span>’s desire and ability to care for its weak ones was fractured by the number of women forced to go into the work force, in so many cases simply because of unindexed tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has shown the way, with the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a woman cannot look after her own <span class="highlight">family</span> then someone else has to and it does then become a matter of dollars and  cents-either  for the husband or the State or some combination of the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not advocating that the Government pay wages to housewives, but I am suggesting that increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in future would be a solid means of encouraging women to leave the work force and to do the job which many of them want to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am happy to inform the honourable member that in Victoria proposals are afoot for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to sit at Bendigo, Ballarat, Horsham, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Mildura, Geelong, Sale, Wangaratta and Hamilton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When you do knock the public sector as with their ideology, those on the other side of this Parliament do, then you are knocking these things: Better roads, better pensions, better overseas aid, better <span class="highlight">family</span> law administration- and even better defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One <span class="highlight">family</span> was recently quoted the sum of$15,000 to have a telephone installed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, I have suggested that such a devolution could occur in relation to sales tax and criminal law in Commonwealth places, and that the States should be able, with better assurance, to refer some of their powers to the Commonwealthfor instance, those in relation to defamation and the remaining aspects of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor, in developing its regionalism concept, recognised that the individual living standards of the average <span class="highlight">family</span>, especially in environmental and cultural terms, depend more on the initiatives and efficiency of local government than on the initiative and efficiency of either State or Federal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The only discussion of which I am aware is the conversation between the officer of my Department and the Registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales referred to in my supplementary answer on 6 April 1976 to a question from the Leader of the Opposition  (Hansard,  page 1 343 ). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-36-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Minister for Health confirm that the Medibank pamphlets produced by the honourable member for Macarthur state that private health insurance funds will offer full medical and hospital coverage for a <span class="highlight">family</span> at a cost of $350 a year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Advisory Committee on Safety in Vehicle Design undertake research with a view to designing vehicles, particularly <span class="highlight">family</span> type vehicles, to enable the fitting of approved child restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I stay in Medibank and pay the <span class="highlight">family</span> premium it will cost $300 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with incomes above $12,000 a year will find it cheaper to get Medibank cover by buying a Medibank premium for about $300 a year to cover their <span class="highlight">family</span> health costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could well add to those factors the importance to those placed in stringent economic conditions of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which increase child endowment measures of the past so markedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that decision it became apparent that, whilst the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act as we know it is a valid exercise of constitutional power in the majority of its clauses, there are various aspects which are deemed to be  ultra vires  the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless there are certain aspects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which are deemed to be outside the Commonwealth jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows from this decision that unless that was directly related to ancillary provisions, the major contest being the question of a divorce, it could not be dealt with under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act but would have to be dealt with under the State law called the Married Women’s Property Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically what the decision is saying is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is a valid Act and the fact that various sections of it may to some extent be invalid does not invalidate the whole Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is adequately catered for in section 12 1 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate provides an opportunity to discuss some of the problems we now see flowing from the administration of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, particularly as it relates to the very difficult area of people who are in conflict and who are unable to maintain their marriages, despite having the best will in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I should like to compliment the honourable member for KingsfordSmith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  on the very clear, concise and succinct manner in which he has placed before the Parliament information relevant to the background and the trials and the tribulations that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act had in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, perhaps, unfortunate that the Commonwealth’s jurisdiction over matrimonial property and custody is limited and that therefore the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia is also limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia would not have jurisdiction in maintenance matters under the ruling of the High Court unless it is allied with matters of principal relief in divorce proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all, it will be seen that the High Court’s decision has meant that the whole concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court Court being able to deal with all matters relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law cannot now be realised as was at first hoped and at first envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe stricter guidelines should be inserted in maintenance Acts as to the matters to be taken into consideration in assessing a reasonable and adequate payment on the same lines as those set out in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which, amongst other things, not only takes into consideration the age and the state of health of each of the parties but is bound to have due regard to the income, the property and the financial resources of either parties, the care or control of a child, the financial needs and obligations of each of the parties, the responsibilities of either party to support any other person and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps if that is not to be followed, the States might give some thought and weigh heavily the incorporation of these matters in State maintenance legislation or even better, legislate to confer these powers on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision is included to enable the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to determine questions of law without the necessity or the expense of an appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, that provision came to be in the Bill at the behest, as it were, of the judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention has been made of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to remind honourable members that an historic occasion occurred yesterday in Western Australia when the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of that <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a very significant step because basic to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was the idea that there ought to be a <span class="highlight">family</span> law court in which all matters relevant to the <span class="highlight">family</span> could be dealt with by the one court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One lesson that we learn from the High Court decision- indeed we suspected when we were debating the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill last year that we might learn it- is that in Australia under our Constitution the Federal Parliament does not have power to legislate with respect to matters relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span> and that therefore under our constitutional set-up the only type of court that can deal with all matters relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a <span class="highlight">family</span> court set up under State law which is invested with the necessary State and Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that I am still hopeful that State governments in States other than Western Australia will turn their minds to the setting up of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed I propose to make approaches to State Attorneys-General again in the light of the High Court decision so that they might consider again whether it would not be desirable to set up State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to comment on what the honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Birney)  said because what he said could relate to proceedings which are currently before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court on appeal and indeed in a proceeding in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention that only because I feel that this is becoming an increasing problem, but it is increasing only because to some extent the pressure on the legal aid commitment is growing in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that more than 75 per cent, perhaps 80 per cent, of the legal aid commitment is taken up with <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very substantial part of that system is the <span class="highlight">family</span> law contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention another matter about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- I say this to the honourable member for Phillip and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In judging it we ought to remember that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is not like the courts in which perhaps some of us have been practising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think that in judging the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court we ought to take these matters into account and not be over-critical in our judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My constant contact with the Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court leads me to the very firm conclusion that the judges of the Court are busy; that they are working well and working indeed beyond the point to which they might be expected to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in Brisbane, for instance, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is over-committed in its work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever may happen in the case of an individual judge- of course, that is a matter for an appellate court to deal with- I want to conclude with a defence of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it is a fair criticism to say that the administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act by those judges is basically open to criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think they are doing a good and thorough job and they are working hard towards the implementation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at some of the decisions that have been made recently on Medibank, on the indexation of taxation, on the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme and on depreciation allowances as incentives to industries, we see that there is nothing more certain than that this Government, in the few months it has been in office, is making ad hoc decisions, it has its priorities and is aiming not at the people in the community who deserve assistance but rather at the people who follow the Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these provisions a student from a poorer <span class="highlight">family</span> could borrow money from the Government to facilitate the payment of tuition fees and living costs while he or she undertook studies subsequent to a first degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Owing to the concern of many people, will he give an assurance that he will maintain the Labor Government’s policy of providing 75 per cent of recurrent costs for child care and <span class="highlight">family</span> day care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last couple of years, most of the attention that has been given to the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law has concentrated on the new divorce, maintenance, custody and matrimonial property legislation contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and on the new <span class="highlight">family</span> courts which have been established under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is proper to acknowledge that many of the persons, both inside and outside Parliament, who expressed views both for and against the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation were motivated by a- desire to preserve and protect the institution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The supporters of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act saw it as upholding the institution of marriage by reducing the bitterness and humiliation in divorce and other matrimonial proceedings and by offering greater encouragement to parties to be reconciled or to terminate their relationship amicably through the use of marriage counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, while the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act deals with cures, this Bill deals with prevention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government recognises, and will continue to support, the invaluable counselling work of both the approved counselling organisations and the <span class="highlight">family</span> court counsellors, we feel that pre-marital education programs and courses can, if supported and made more widely available, also play an important part in helping to reduce marital instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marriage counselling organisations that are approved under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are deemed to be approved for the purposes of these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way as under the relevant provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, the amendments provide for approved organisations to furnish annual financial statements and reports on their pre-marital education activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in recognition of the benefit that counselling might offer to persons contemplating marriage, the Government has decided that where a person under 18 has been refused parental consent to marry and wishes to apply to a magistrate for his consent instead, the person should first have to attend counselling with an approved marriage counselling organisation under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistently with the policy of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act towards the use of counselling, the Bill does not go to the extent of imposing a more general requirement of compulsory attendance at premarital education or counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act prescribing the circumstances in which a marriage is void are to be incorporated in the Marriage Act, where one would expect to find them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament has approved major reforms of <span class="highlight">family</span> law, the reform of the law of dissolution of marriage has preceded the reform of the law governing the formation of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1959 preceded the Marriage Act of 196 1 and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act of last year preceded this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of provisions of the Bill provide for various functions now exercised under the Act by courts and judges or magistrates to be exercised by the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts and judges of those courts respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is consistent with the Government’s aims and policies to give help during those early difficult years when <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments are probably high and when job payment is relatively low in comparison with what may be anticipated in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the House is in such a very good mood, I might say that he and I certainly derived what skill in or appreciation we may have of the English language from members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> whose father was a member of this House at the time and one of whom is married to a former  Clerk  of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government announced its fiscal policy decisions on 20 May, including the full indexation of personal income tax, the generous <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the modifications that we are talking about today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because there is a ceiling to the levy, people have to make decisions, and hence choices, about whether they opt out of the levy and pay the ceiling, depending on their individual and <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes, and whether they opt for intermediate or private cover with Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tourist resort of Point Lookout was begun in 1934 by the Kennedy <span class="highlight">family</span> and, as a result of their venture on this island, the first post office, the first accommodation, the first shop and the first transport across an old bush track to this area of the island were established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few years the wages factor has resulted in a big downturn in the service that has been provided to the visitors to that pan of the world, so much so that it has become completely a <span class="highlight">family</span> concern, with families running these individual organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which is helping 300 000 families and over 800 000 children, was and is hailed as one of the most far-reaching social reforms in the history of Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If subclause 3(c) is enacted certain judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia will be able to exercise this new power as well as existing judges- judges of the supreme court of a Territory and certain judges of State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill is giving weight to that as did the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there will be no need for that definition to remain in what is now known as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 5 1 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act sets out the circumstances in which a marriage is void. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst marriage counselling organisations are already in existence under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, the Bill will permit voluntary organisations that are willing to conduct premarital courses to apply to the AttorneyGeneral for approval and appropriate funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of interest that in the first 6 months of its establishment there have been 32 000 applications for divorce to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members who are trying to interject ever find the time to go into a divorce court or what is now called as a result of innovation by the Labor Government, more humanely and decently the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, they will see that it is those real problems that cause marital instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Government members wrap themselves in this false cloak they will ensure that people go once more into the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, there to fight out their disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for La Trobe, who is not interjecting but who is at least sighing vigorously as if he has had something to do with an upset marriage, wants to know about this matter he can attend on any day he wishes in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts of this country and find out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently I spent some time in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and, of course, in the Divorce Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The personal income tax indexation provisions and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are the greatest social reforms since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will strengthen marriages tremendously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a provision comparable with a provision in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act relating to marriage counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act it is not necessary because the provisions are clearly based on a conciliatory matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Counsellors are appointed under section 37 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if there has to be a document it ought to be as simple as possible and it ought to be consistent with the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 43 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act sets out the principles to be applied by the courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those principles were adopted, if the form were to incorporate those principles and if the Parliament were to see that the form was therefore consistent with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act then I would be able to accept the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The girl was from a Roman Catholic <span class="highlight">family</span> very strong in its faith and the boy was from a <span class="highlight">family</span> of practising Anglicans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is obvious that when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was enacted in the Parliament about a year ago, contrary to the suggestion of the previous  speaker,  it required the support of honourable members on both sides of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party who voted for the enactment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, as did members of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just as correct to say that members of the ALP fought vigorously against the enactment of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI as did members of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is little point in the honourable member for Hunter claiming praise for the changes in <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation which have come about in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act of last year precedes this BUI, the Marriage Amendment BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill we attempted to deal- I believe we did so in a very realistic way- with the community attitudes towards divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 43 (a) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act says:  the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought it was very noticeable that the occasion tonight so far as he was concerned was a <span class="highlight">family</span> affair, and if I can speak of that particular marriage, it is one of a union of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life, and he is the issue of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, there is a provision in the Bill that will allow an appeal- if this Bill goes through, as I am sure it will- to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act there is provision to set up an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will also find an amount of $25,000 set aside to establish a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get to the real point, and it is the real point, there will be an institute in this country which will do the sort of things that the honourable member suggested and its establishment will be the result of the combined will- not the Labor Party will, but the combined will- of this Parliament as expressed in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them, for instance- it is really the only matter of substance, I would think- brings into the Marriage Act the definition of domocile that is in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first amendment simply omits the word and’ and the second amendment introduces the concept of domicile that is in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be concerned with the fundamentals of how people can live together, how they should be encouraged to live, and support <span class="highlight">family</span> life and all that that stands for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a representative or official of a state or an official or other agent of an international organization of an inter-governmental character or a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of such a person forming part of his household. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are seeking to expedite the reuniting of immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members in this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What steps has his Department taken in the last 3 months to make these wider <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion categories known in the Lebanon and Cyprus and to bring them to the attention of the Lebanese and Cypriot communities in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me assure the honourable gentleman and all honourable gentlemen that the criteria in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion being applied throughout the world apply to parents, husbands and wives and dependent children of Lebanese residents of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It costs much less to settle a <span class="highlight">family</span> in a planned growth centre than it does to provide the same roads, schools, housing, transport and sewerage in crowded or remote suburbs and towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how much a <span class="highlight">family</span> pays it cannot buy a road, a school, a railway, a hospital, or a university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> that has no hospital in its neighbourhood, no sewer, no park, no university, is poorer than the <span class="highlight">family</span> that has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is that the Government’s new program of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is of specific and particular relevance to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable members would agree that many Aborigines would be most unlikely to be in income brackets where they would be able to obtain full benefit from the old <span class="highlight">family</span> rebate scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will certainly all get full benefit from the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary negotiations have already taken place with the University which, since 1 972, has had a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Research Unit funded through the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in 1972 the Liberal-Country Party Government commissioned, with the support of the State Ministers responsible for child and social welfare, a <span class="highlight">family</span> research project within the University of New South Wales to undertake a series of studies directed towards understanding and documenting <span class="highlight">family</span> disruption and breakdown and changing <span class="highlight">family</span> patterns in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reference to the former, wide ranging research is being conducted on <span class="highlight">family</span> services in each State and the Territories, to ascertain current and future service needs of families in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These studies are complementary to the work of the commission’s <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee on which is represented relevant departments at Federal and State levels, and the voluntary welfare sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee will continue in order to complete a major report in this area during 1 976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some officers will be used in activities, such as administering research projects and fellowship awards, servicing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Services Committee and undertaking work in the area of social welfare manpower planning, responsibility for which will be absorbed by the department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major advance is the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which will help 800 000 disadvantaged children and which will give their mothers an assured income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies particularly to the Aboriginal population which will benefit greatly from the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">family</span> I know has a contract for cutting railway sleepers from the timber on its property, which gives it a small cash flow while it cannot sell its cattle profitably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members to look at the dramatic increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances provided in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government persisted with an arrangement whereby the surviving spouse to a marriage very often had to sell the <span class="highlight">family</span> home in order to pay government charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many previous speakers have addressed themselves to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable members have detailed the long list- <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, personal income tax indexation, handicapped persons’ allowances, the new test for pension eligibility, the experiment with a new housing allowance voucher system, the expansion of health programs, community health, hospitals and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, about which the honourable member spoke at length, I am sure that they will realise that the welfare of people is uppermost in the minds of all Government supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> break-up of any kind is a matter of importance to society because the <span class="highlight">family</span> has a number of important social functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has the main responsibility for socialising the next generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An incomplete <span class="highlight">family</span> is likely to find it more difficult than a complete <span class="highlight">family</span> to carry out these functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the father decides to stay at home or continue to work, society is not prepared to support him in his efforts to maintain his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many lone parents’ needs arise simply from the fact that providing for physical, social and emotional needs of all the <span class="highlight">family</span> members is usually a full time job for 2 adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many men are not acquainted with the skills which are taken for granted in the running of a <span class="highlight">family</span> home, for example, cooking, house cleaning, budgeting and buying of children’s clothes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a father decides to try and keep a <span class="highlight">family</span> together he will almost certainly find it a struggle to maintain a full time job and still provide for child minding during the time he is away outside school hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight in speaking to the Budget the member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman),  and I must add in parenthesis after hearing what he said there is no prospect for Prospect, the learned doctor- doctor of neither mathematics nor logics I would presume- made some wild assertions about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will speak about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which were announced in May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to read the actual figures of benefits related to the pre-<span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and post-<span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child will be 80c per week worse off; a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children will be 30c better off; a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children will be $1.40 better off; a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children will be $2.25 better off; and a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 5 children will be $3.85 better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frivolity aside, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are a most important innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to be given to womenfolk in general will be saved or consumed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that people will not continue to denigrate the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in the way that has been done, and done again tonight, because the figures that I have quoted are accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these women are second income earners in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third group consists of those who have a <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother would normally be a second income-earner within the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mothers cannot buy groceries, shoes, school uniforms and basic <span class="highlight">family</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that his <span class="highlight">family</span> would not think it an impertinence on my part to say that that could well have been a motto for that very distinguished airman and parliamentarian, because he did serve again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether gentlemen opposite recognise the value of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has now become a significant element in <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So obsessed with old style, out of date, economic propositions are members opposite that they have not recognised that wages make up only one part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the worker has to spend and what is available to him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> are the keys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt we will hear from the other member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Government not sustain the beginnings of an offer of a social contract which tax indexation and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance schemes provided, and attempt to collaborate with the unions in maintaining the social wage and achieving industrial peace? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spending on Aborigines is decimated; real overseas aid falls to a lower proportion of national income than that which has applied for over 10 years; the real value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is already falling; a decision about student allowances is still deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in my electorate will be able to see that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are going directly to mothers, that this money is not being stacked up by greedy governments and handed back as deductions without interest to taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the indexation system is to be adhered to then it should also apply to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, that most important measure to which the Government attended early in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically they suggest that women leaving work to have families should be paid a benefit for the period during which they are caring for their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In circumstances where the children of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are cared for at home and are not forcing governments to provide child care faculties by way of creches and pre-schools, a differential payment might be considered to take care of the different circumstances applying in <span class="highlight">family</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will assist some 300 000 low income families with in excess of 800 000 children involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a number of depressed areas in my electorate of Bowman and I know from speaking with many of my constituents what a welcome move the introduction of these vastly increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances constitute a major social reform which the Opposition has still not recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is a measure which will ensure that those who need the assistance will get it in the most direct way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that he has one sister, but I think that his parents must have spoilt him and made him more selfish, more self-centred and even more ruthless than he might have been if he had belonged to an ordinary working class <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been mentioned by various speakers on this side of the chamber that one of the greatest achievements in the social security field has been the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the <span class="highlight">family</span> life of this country is one of the most important aspects to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social security and welfare provisions in the Budget follow the major restructuring and improvement of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have been substantially increased, as has been announced, but I think it is worth my while reading repeating them tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking during the adjournment debate last night he referred to the effect of the exchange of tax rebates in respect of children for the new higher <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and he gave some peculiar figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had not introduced its new child endowment scheme and abolished the tax rebate, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child could have claimed $4.35 a week as a tax rebate plus 50c for the first child, making a total of $4.85 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child will receive child endowment at the rate of $3.50 a week, a loss of $1.35 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous arrangement, the calculation for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children was twice the $4.35 a week tax rebate, which equals $8.70, plus one lot of child endowment at 50c a week and another at $1 a week, totalling $10.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a loss, under the new system, of $1.70 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous system a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children would have received 3 times the $4.35 a week tax rebate, which equals $13.05, plus the total child endowment to which they would have been entitled of $3.50 a week, making a total amount of $16.55. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new system a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children will receive $14.50 a week, a loss of $2.05c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully the honourable member for Eden-Monaro could make the appropriate calculations for families with 4, 5 and 6 children but I shall give him the figures for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new child endowment rate for such a <span class="highlight">family</span> is $20.50 a week, which represents a loss of $2.65 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a statement by the Minister for Repatriation in which he said that repatriation beneficiaries would continue to receive repatriation treatment at no cost to the individual or at half cost for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: If a married ex-serviceman in receipt of full repatriation benefits wishes to have more than Medibank standard coverage for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, does the exserviceman sacrifice the privilege of full repatriation benefits without cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the combined effect of the tax indexation proposals and the increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances plus the abolition of deductions for children and the Medibank levy or the payments required to be made to private health insurance companies will be that many people will be no better off as a result of the fiscal measures of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there will be the effect of the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, to which 1 will refer in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which has been introduced and to the introduction of personal tax indexation as from 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances is concerned, what is important is that in low income groups- income groups where insufficient tax is paid to take advantage of rebates for children- the substantially increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are a net addition to incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 5 children, the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances represents something like $27.50 a week or a cheque for $330 for a 12-week period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has also pointed out that the social wage component in our policy of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and with tax indexation the increase here is above that of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those with the better emotional and <span class="highlight">family</span> resources have the least difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aspect is perhaps best illustrated by what we have done in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the implementing of tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to give a few details of the Budget’s new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances because I know that many Australians listening to this broadcast perhaps even now are not fully aware of the details of the total shape of the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main features of the system are these: The former child endowment payments will be replaced by a new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances under which the <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child will receive $3.50 a week from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children will receive $8.50 which was formerly $1.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children will receive $14.50 a week; that was formerly $3.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children will receive $20.50 a week and the <span class="highlight">family</span> with 5 children will receive $27.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that is that for the higher income groups the gains from the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances offset by the loss of tax rebates and consequent higher tax payments- it is more or less a line ball position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these measures- the indexing of taxes and the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which gives special help to low income groups- are measures which, so to speak, confer authority on this Government to carry through its policy of containing the increase in wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly approximately 300 000 low-income families with 800 000 children Will benefit by the excellent <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally enlightened is the social reform by way of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, so far as real disposable income is concerned, any judgments regarding the effects of the new health service financing arrangements would also need to take into account the introduction from 1 July last of full personal tax indexation and significant improvements in the manner of assisting families through <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a husband and wife are both taxpayers, it is proposed that their individual levy liabilities are not, in total, to exceed the <span class="highlight">family</span> ceiling of $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus- to conclude my introductory references to the ceiling arrangements- a serviceman with a <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay no more levy than $ 1 50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When introducing the National Health Amendment Bill 1976 1 indicated to honourable members that the cost of this hospital-only insurance for a person remaining in Medibank standard was estimated at $ 135 a year or $2.60 a week- at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate- and would be payable in addition to the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the contribution rates for Medibank private health insurance were being determined it became apparent that the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables would exceed $2.60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its concern to keep the cost of this type of insurance within the reach of those with low to medium incomes, the Government decided to give a subsidy to hold the <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rate to $2.60 a week and the single contribution rate to $1.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum rates of Commonwealth subsidy are based on the difference between the contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables for privately insured persons in Medibank private and $1.30 a week for single rate contributors and $2.60 a week for <span class="highlight">family</span> rate contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides for the rates of $1.30 a week for single contributors and $2.60 a week for <span class="highlight">family</span> contributors, and for the rates of Commonwealth subsidies, to be varied by regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions have become redundant as a result of the proposal to introduce individual and <span class="highlight">family</span> levy ceilings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development aware that contracts to construct 400 <span class="highlight">family</span>  homes to be built by the New South Wales Government have not been let although tenders closed on 19 July? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been informed that contracts for 400 <span class="highlight">family</span> homes in New South Wales are being delayed and that tenders did close approximately 2 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this is it intended that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which have replaced the rebates for dependent children will be indexed so that they retain their real value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did the Labor Opposition say when we introduced the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knew very well that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme was a reform that it should have introduced when it was in government, but it did not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, if I can believe the report in the  Australian  and attributed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson),  the families of these young people can look after them; they will be under wholesome <span class="highlight">family</span> supervision for 3 months until - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that a number of amendments were made to the Act by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Act 1 976, which was passed by Parliament in the last sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 80 per cent of Commonwealth funds appropriated for legal aid matters referred to private practitioners is in respect of matters arising under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 80 per cent of this figure therefore will represent payments for <span class="highlight">family</span> law legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having in mind the facilities provided by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, a fee of  $60  is not regarded as excessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of applications filed in a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- at the moment only the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australiathe Bill provides that the fees are to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the request of Western Australia, the Bill will enable the Commonwealth AttorneyGeneral to delegate his power of intervention in proceedings to the Attorney-General of a State ha ling r. State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, Government expenditure has increased by only 8 per cent and not 1 1 per cent as the Treasurer claims, because in that 1 1 per cent he includes the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance increases which were matched by cutbacks in the tax deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is arguable that the first vital momentum towards recovery has been created by the introduction of personal income tax indexation and the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer very briefly to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson did consider the question of making the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others have suggested that unless <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are means tested or made taxable, substantial sums of money will go to the welltodo and inequities will result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2 also provides an answer to the Opposition criticism relating to the impact of disposable <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes on consumption expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the combined impact of personal income tax indexation, increased pension and other welfare benefits, and in particular the effect of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances program, after allowing for the abolition of the tax rebates for children, will provide a net income gain for low income families which have a relatively high propensity to consume, as do pensioners, who with full and automatic indexation are assured of having their incomes increased proportionately by at least as much, and probably more, than the general working population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 is due to the loss of tax rebates for children, but this has been more than countered by the increased transfer payment to families through the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme has provided a massive redistribution of income from the wealthier families to the poorest families in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have mentioned the very generous new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, because they deserve to be mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Budget shows, before young families and people in need benefited under the generosity of our Government, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were very small and under the inflation that exists today did not do very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, under the new rates a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child gets $3.50 a week; before it got 50c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children the allowance is $8.50 a week; before it was $ 1.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowances increase according to the number of children in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hate to work out how much he gets in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The total cost of these new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will be $ 1,000m this year, and next year it will be more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My electorate of Lang happens to be one of those with a number of people who came from Lebanon residing within its boundaries and for the past few months, because of the conflict- perhaps one should say the civil war- that is raging in that country, I have had a great number of those people coming into my office asking for assistance to get some of their immediate <span class="highlight">family</span>, other relatives and friends out to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The husband then travelled to Lebanon to get his <span class="highlight">family</span> out to another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was told by our officials in that country that they had received no advice from Australia regarding his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are dealing with a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They remained in the Strathallan <span class="highlight">family</span> for about a century and were then acquired by the late  Sir John  Ferguson, the famous collector of Australiana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 occasions in the last week of sitting there was discussion during the adjournment debate about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said when I had an opportunity to speak about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, I do not really think that there is any prospect for Prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the night after I had made a statement about the net gains to families due to the very forward thinking <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the honourable member for Prospect was very rude about my engineering training and claimed that as a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties he probably had a great deal to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He attacked what I said about the net effect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel very seriously about the fact that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are one of the greatest social reforms to have been effected in this country for a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was under some strange misapprehension that for every child of a <span class="highlight">family</span> there was a $200 rebate; he said that in his speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell honourable members that the people in my electorate, especially the women, are very much aware of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances contained in this latest Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The so-called <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme is largely nothing more than a shifting sideways of the children’s rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  put his finger on the point during question time today, to the great embarrassment of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch),  when he raised a query as to when, if at all, the Government will index the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He realises something that few members of the Liberal Party of Australia realise- he will have to say it to them 50 times before they understand it, although it is a relatively simple proposition- that is, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was created at the expense of the child rebate allowance solely to avoid indexing that child rebate allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The saving to the Government by shifting this payment sideways is something like $90m a year and each year, with the erosion of the value of money caused by inflation, the value of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will diminish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is wholly and solely the reason for the introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these initiatives are firmly in line with the Government’s continuing concern to effect the reunion of close <span class="highlight">family</span> relatives overseas with Lebanese residents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, expresses to the people of China profound regret and tenders its deep sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has demanded the rejection of all <span class="highlight">family</span> ties and accepted decencies, culminating in its assault of Confucianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He might also have referred to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme which will increase the capacity to spend of certain categories of families and increase their well-being over and above that which would have occurred under previous arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee makes similar comment about dental care, the lack of vitamin C, the incidence of gastro-enteritis, hook worm, the problems of alcohol, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and mental health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the phoneyness of the Government’s claim of keeping the Budget outlays the same as they were last year is exposed by the fact that included in the 1 1.3 per cent increase in outlays is child endowment or the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments which were a consequence of the abolition of a tax deduction which amounted to $700m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of my colleagues has pointed out very effectively that if the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, which was placed there at the expense of the rebate deductions available for dependants, is removed, the expansion in welfare payments is only 9 per cent, with an inflation rate of 12 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every <span class="highlight">family</span> affected by unemployment in this country, there will be a loss of more than $5,000 prospective income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On current unemployment trends, the reduction in disposable income for 1977 will be $600m, or $150 per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one adds to that the quite remarkable initiatives that have been taken in social reforms, such as in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, automatic cost of living adjustments for pensioners, personal tax indexation, and an improved and workable Medibank which will not bankrupt the country, it is clear that we have introduced measures more sweeping than any even contemplated by the so-called Whitlam reform Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions that can be made at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a statement by the Minister for Repatriation in which he said that repatriation beneficiaries would continue to receive repatriation treatment at no cost to the individual or at half cost for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister If a married ex-serviceman in receipt of full repatriation benefits wishes to have more than Medibank standard coverage for his <span class="highlight">family</span>, does the ex-serviceman sacrifice the privilege of full repatriation benefits without cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a beneficiary with dependants whom he wishes to cover under Medibank standard would accordingly pay half the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate of Medibank levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has a wife only, then the wife could be insured as an individual at one half the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But should he also have dependent children, then the fund would require that health insurance for his wife and children take the form of full <span class="highlight">family</span> cover, which would include himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have introduced full indexation of personal income tax in one year and an entirely new and imaginative scheme greatly to increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, to put more money back into the pockets of the people who earn that money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the actual cost to the <span class="highlight">family</span> will be $ 1 35 as originally promised by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ceiling premium acts as a ceiling on <span class="highlight">family</span> income to prevent the 2-<span class="highlight">family</span> income from being penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of this $50m subsidy would have had the effect of increasing the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate for hospital cover from our proposal of $135 a year to $200 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has extended to the mothers of Australia the most generous <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in history, namely, $3.50 for the first child, $5 for the second child, $6 for the third and fourth children and $7 for the fifth and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has to have an operation once every three weeks for the contributor to pass out square. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have as our basic god, as our basic gaol, the purchasing of votes through the welfare system which was the sole motivation in assisting the middle class twoincome <span class="highlight">family</span> at the expense of the worker in this kind of situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Treasurer also confirm that a working wife whose husband is paying the levy at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate will not have the levy deducted from her salary and be forced to make a similar loan to the Taxation Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Attorney-General seen recent reports which indicate that the New South Wales Attorney-General,  Mr Walker,  has described <span class="highlight">family</span> law in New South Wales as a judicial cross-country course and an untidy jumble of jurisdictions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year this Parliament in passing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill put section 41 in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand why State Attorneys-General do not agree to set up State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those courts are set up all the Commonwealth law and the State law on the <span class="highlight">family</span> can be administered in the one court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long term if the States do not agree to set up State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, in order to achieve this principle we may have to seek some reference from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One condition is that the judges in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts be appointed to the age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In enforcing section 41 I cannot direct what judge is to be appointed to a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year 23 judges have been appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, and each of them, I believe, was a good appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point that the New South Wales Attorney-General raises is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges cannot exercise all the jurisdiction; that jurisdiction has to be exercised by magistrates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Magistrates are exercising <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction now in every State, and so far as I am concerned they can continue to exercise jurisdiction in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the New South Wales Attorney-General has a ready solution, and that is to call in his secretary and start dictating a letter to me saying that he is prepared to negotiate to set up a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had been our hope that we would be able to pass the legislation in relation to health insurance and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill so that it could have been referred to another place so that that chamber would have had notice of the legislation and in order that it could be adequately considered for debate next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that we have the Budget before us, we know that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was not a flash in the pan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is so fundamental a decision that one wonders why on earth none of us had not thought of it before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty is that people will have to pay the maximum levy of $300 a year for a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit if their taxable income reaches $12,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the net result, unless the Taxation Office has come up with some brilliant suggestion, will be either that people will owe money at the end of the year in order to come up to the $300 which is proposed as the levy or they will have overpaid significantly as a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit before the end of the year and will have vastly exceeded the $300 levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are entrusted with the conscientious control of the nation’s coffers for the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>, just as any responsible parent conscientiously administers the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should be able to care for myself and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> was paying only $3 or $4 a week at the very most for the maximum form of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the situation stands, if the husband pays the <span class="highlight">family</span> levy of up to $5.80 a week, which automatically covers his wife and children for public hospital ward and 85 per cent of medical costs, his working wife will still have to pay the single levy of up to $2.90 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program is intended to run until 30 September with the health program grants that have been made available to assist the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations with their clinical activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are continuing discussions with the States as to how these funds should be spent in order to maintain the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is a further amendment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation was to get away from the question of costs and pecuniary penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we adopt the idea of the fee on the filing of a divorce petition we will never get anywhere in trying to reach the ideal situation under the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation of reducing divorces, reducing friction and doing away with the hardship that is obviously caused by parties being unable to agree, particularly on matters related to the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no particular disagreement with the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  on how he is administering the <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation in respect of making legal aid available except in relation to the severe limitations on legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General has suggested that clause 3 is necessary because of difficulty in the interpretation of ‘State wards’ and the question of their status under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition agrees that it is important to give the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court as much jurisdiction as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise the difficulties that now flow from the problems enunciated by the High Court in the decision in  Farrelly  v.  <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth does not really have the constitutional power to deal with ex-nuptual children and others, and that is certainly going to affect the efficacy of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be much more beneficial if we were to get the States to confer their jurisdiction on the Commonwealth, while creating State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the whole of the State jurisdiction were conferred upon the Commonwealth there would be no gap because the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, with jurisdiction conferred in accordance with that placitum, would cover the whole field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that because of the practices in the courts there could be six different interpretations under State laws and there could well be a fragmentation of the real definition of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From an Australian point of view, I think it is fair and reasonable that there should be no State boundaries in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> law, including custody and maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are one people with one citizenship and we ought to have one <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian State Police have refused to enforce Orders made under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act because they say it is a Commonwealth Act and therefore they have no jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is very good in relation to conciliation, the reduction of friction and the assistance of people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill clarifies certain provisions of the principal Act- the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act- relating to maintenance and custody where the child or children concerned are in the care of State welfare authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important for the public to realise that this legislation does not alter to any significant degree the fundamental principles of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It creates the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and provides for the establishment of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, people who use the facilities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- its staff, its buildings, its documents and forms, its equipment and servicesshould make some contribution to the costs which would otherwise be borne by the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eighty per cent of Commonwealth funds for legal aid matters referred to private legal practitioners is in respect of matters arising under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5m will go to the legal profession for services rendered in assisting people in need; 80 per cent of the $9.5m will therefore be for <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 97 (3) of the principle Act provides,  inter alia,  that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall proceed without undue formality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will fulfil its purpose or achieve the standing it will need to have to administer effectively the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction, until it eliminates, as far as possible, legalism and formality from its proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not mean the publishing of the evidence that appears before the Court, but has it yet been decided whether the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts are to hear their cases in camera or in public? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know whether the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, where people are now having to pay $60 before they can file their petition and before they can go before the Court, is operating in the correct manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also quote from a statement received from a person whom I know well, who complains that the barrister who appeared for his wife in previous proceedings before a court was the judge who heard the case when it came before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that a number of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges were appointed from divorce practices and that it could easily happen that a barrister who has appeared in court against a person in a hearing could be sitting on the bench hearing that persons petition before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are going to be regulations made about the activities of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and I know that this is the second set of amendments which have been made to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act since it came into operation this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note from an article in the daily newspaper that a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council is to be set up to review the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the article indicated that some members of Parliament would be part of this Council, you should be aware of the antagonism that has been created by  Mr Fraser’s  persona] amendment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, section 75 (2) (i) that permits excessive bias against men to be exercised by the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General to consider whether the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is operating in the way this Parliament intended when the legislation was passed through the Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- In answer to what the honourable member for Lang  (Mr Stewart)  has said, may I say that I am constantly keeping the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts under surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering what the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  said about fees and the payment of fees and also what was said by the honourable member for Braddon  (Mr Groom)  in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> courts, it is necessary to bear in mind that these courts are basically informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one school of thought which has been upheld by the High Court, namely, that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court proceedings are adversary proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed, as he sees it, to lead to a more conciliatory method of dealing with the particular’ problem confronting the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the cost of running the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts will be something over $llm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Braddon quite properly pointed out, $7.2m or 80 per cent of the estimated $9.5m that will be paid to the legal profession for legal aid services will relate to <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can say that the Government’s proposed appropriation for <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law legal aid is in any way trifling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kinsford-Smith also said something about State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he knows, and as I have reported to the Parliament, we are engaged in discussions with the States to set up these courts so that all law relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span> can be dealt with in the one tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have <span class="highlight">family</span> law administered by one court, if matters such as arose from the case  Farrelly  v.  Farrelly  are to be dealt with, if matters such as property, apart from divorce, the custody of illegitimate children, applications for custody by in-laws of children of a marriage and applications for custody in relation to children who are only  de facto  children of a particular marriage- for instance, the child of one of the parties- are to be dealt with by the court the only way of doing it at the moment is by having State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But may I say that I am not very sanguine of receiving it with the result that some time later I may have to go back to the States again and ask them again whether they will have State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say also that State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts avoid this problem of judges being appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, there are 23 judges appointed for life in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that if the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts are set up, most of those judges would transfer to the State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts in their State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court system would enable that to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that the State Attorneys-General put up against my idea is the proposition that in some way I am interfering in the appointment of their judges because under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act the Commonwealth Attorney-General has a right to veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is really no intrusion at all when we come to consider the fact that under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act if a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is set up, the Commonwealth Government has to pay for the establishment and the maintenance of that court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say to the House that the question of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts is well and truly in mind, as is the improvement and surveillance of those courts, together with the matter of legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if they go to the court and get a warrant under section 64 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, I think they will find that the Commonwealth Police will execute the warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I think the honourable member said, it is a defended divorce case, it would not be in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supreme Court no longer exercises jurisdiction in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters except those that are remnants, as it were, from the previous period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was cut off on 1 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Victoria is concerned, at the moment that Court has, I think, 6 or 7 judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to bring the judges on stream, as it were, with an appreciation of the likely continuation of this pressure on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been put in the Bill at the request of the Western Australian Government which suggested that as it had its own <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court it should be possible to delegate powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If other States were to adopt <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts, then a very great problem that is approaching would be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to point out that there are 3 ways in which the ‘ present looming and serious problem can be overcome: Firstly, the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> courts; secondly, a reference of power from the States; and, thirdly, a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If New South Wales, which has the largest proportion of the population of this country and the greatest number of divorce applications is to take a lead, it should take the lead of establishing a <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings me to the point that we thought that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which we all passed here, covered most of the matters about which we are now complaining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I repeat that we passed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill following the free debate in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fees are going to be so high that people are going to say that we have taken a wrong approach to the <span class="highlight">family</span> law concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regret having to stand down men with <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments who want to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the introduction of full personal tax indexation, the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the major increase in assistance to the aged and the handicapped, the automatic linking of pensions to changes in the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The young children in my <span class="highlight">family</span> tell me that there is a song on the hit parade entitled  We Do It. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Which honourable member opposite has been game enough to stand up and say that the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme is the greatest social justice move in this country in 75 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my firm belief that after 10 years the average borrower from these societies has his <span class="highlight">family</span> well on the way and has met the early expenses of providing the furnishings and other amenities he may require for his home and that he then has to look forward in the remaining years only to paying off the balance of his initial debt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By his own admission he was insuring his <span class="highlight">family</span> through a private society but has now joined Medibank Private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I draw attention to the very forward looking and major changes that have been taken with regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That pressure, to some extent, is relieved by the innovation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is my hope that it is the beginning of further underpinning of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the policy of the Government to recognise the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the cohesive force in society, and the Government’s aim is to give recognition to the necessity of strengthening its influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is terribly important that the country develop a philosophy for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are too many families in Australia who take the position of the <span class="highlight">family</span> for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are unaware that the <span class="highlight">family</span> as they understand it is under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, however, in the large silent majority of families a strongly held view that the primary care of young children should be given by their mother in a comfortable, secure <span class="highlight">family</span> setting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This reform for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will enable an increasing number of families to do just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to read some of the literature that is available from time to time to discover that there are many who have an ideological commitment to changing the nature of society and replacing the normal <span class="highlight">family</span> care of children with a substitute care- care by the state- of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that have been introduced will relieve to some extent the economic pressure on families that up until now have faced increasing difficulty in gaining sufficient resources to enable the mother to be the primary care giver of young children during the preschool years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget, containing as it does provision for the necessary funds to enable the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to continue to be paid, will assist those young families to meet the financial commitments involved in caring for young children.In a question I asked the Treasurer about a fortnight ago I urged upon him that when reviewing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances he do 2 things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I asked that he maintain the real value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that are now payable and, if possible, index them so that they rise in a regular fashion and so that young couples either raising a <span class="highlight">family</span> or planning a <span class="highlight">family</span> can do so in the knowledge that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will provide in real terms a significant contribution to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I asked the Treasurer to look into the possibility of raising in real terms the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances payable to mothers with young children of pre-school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those support services include the provision of a higher <span class="highlight">family</span> income to enable parents to provide for their families the standard of living the community has now come to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is possible when the children of a <span class="highlight">family</span> are at school for the mother to work and she chooses to do so- and over 50 per cent of mothers in the community make that choice- then in those circumstances the <span class="highlight">family</span> has 2 incomes, but families with young children are very often dependent on only one income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for careful examination of <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes to ensure that families with young pre-school children have sufficient income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That income can be supplemented by the provision of substantially higher <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This idea of substitute care is conjured up because within the community we have not identified clearly enough our philosophy for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is developing in their areas a child care centre, they should go along to ensure that it develops upon the basis for which it is being established- to support the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a support for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, not a substitute for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final point I make is that one method of providing that added income is to carry out a review of our tax structure- a review designed to show concern that people should be given an incentive to work and to earn more, and that a careful examination should be made of the possibility of looking at the position of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> with pre-school children to ensure that it is not disadvantaged when compared with the 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span> which has the same income as the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comparative tax take from those families, which are equal in all respects, places the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> at a considerable disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think careful consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing in the case of the <span class="highlight">family</span> with preschool children an optional income splitting system in the form of some concessional <span class="highlight">family</span> tax that recognises the need of families with young children to have larger resources available to them than the present tax system allows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be of particular assistance to married women who wish to undertake training, particularly married women in the low income groups who have a desire to undertake training but would like to relate that desire to their <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Treasurer inform the House why the Medibank levy exemption forms make provision for exemption from the Medibank levy for a working wife whose husband purchases private health insurance at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate, but make no provision for exemption from the levy if her husband pays the Medibank levy at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that most farmers whose <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes are likely to be below  $10,500  will be far better off paying the Medibank levy and taking out hospital-only insurance if they wish to insure for doctor of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Treasurer why the Medibank levy exemption forms make provision for exemption from the Medibank levy for a working wife whose husband purchases private health insurance at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate but make no provision for exemption from the levy if her husband pays the Medibank levy at the <span class="highlight">family</span> rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approximate situation is that money outlays are expected to increase by 7.8 per cent, excluding the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which are, of course, completely offset by the increased tax receipts from the abolishing of child rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has introduced a system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which gives the greatest assistance to people on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way that we like to think governments can plan, we like to think that we plan our own <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They broke up into sub-groups concerned with the care of the aged, concerned with the care of young people and <span class="highlight">family</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those initiatives were in line with the Government’s continuing concern to effect the reunion of close <span class="highlight">family</span> relatives overseas with Lebanese residents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not recognise the position of families where the mother is lost from the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no pension automatically available for men comparable to a widow’s pension or a supporting mother’s benefit, yet the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s needs are exactly the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lone fathers are therefore forced to work and have less chance of keeping the <span class="highlight">family</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The father must be given an option to spend more time at home in order to keep his <span class="highlight">family</span> together and to be able to provide adequately from part time work only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the statement by the honourable member for Perth that it has a dreadful psychological impact upon not only the father but also the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances have been substantially increased and rebates for dependent children abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A total of $70.7m has been provided for the payment of grants to the States, local government authorities and other eligible organisations under the community health program, as well as assisting major national voluntary organisations in the <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also little chance for the foundation of <span class="highlight">family</span> stability and the growth of self-respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In working out the contents of community profiles, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances received by a community will be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention here that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, which is estimated to provide $16m directly to Aboriginal families, is not regarded as a substitute for special Aboriginal programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out to the House on 25 August the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal families and gives them an independence and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, he is not only uncomfortable about that, but he is also uncomfrotable about the fact that we have introduced a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme- a scheme which any honest, objective person would agree is of more direct benefit to the lower income earners in our community than to the higher income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has introduced a filing fee of $60 for each document filed under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should talk to a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 dependent children and see what they think about the economic package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I must pay a tribute to the present Minister who, of all the Ministers for Immigration with whom I have dealt in the last 1 0 years, has given the most compassionate and sympathetic ear to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions and applications by people to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the proposition that people have to commit themselves, sell up everything, bring the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> out to this country and sign an undertaking that they are going to stay here forever is ridiculous if we want to attract the people who are intelligent enough to have alternative choices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here they can be integrated into the Austraiian way of life and, by reason of human suffering and by reason of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, they can be given a much needed place within the <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1960s we had to show that patience and ingenuity in establishing <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships between prospective migrants from Yugoslavia and Greece and thensponsors in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are not, however, the international agencies- refugee and migration agencieshelping Lebanese <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion in Australia as there were in helping the earlier migrants or refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The emphasis is on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion which introduces a small number of people into the work force and on attracting people with qualifications and skills which are in short supply in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department are looking at these skilled workers with a view to getting them to this country as quickly as possible, particularly those who will join <span class="highlight">family</span> units which are already well established here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the people who will be competing with Australians for jobs in terms of the immigration intake fall largely within the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion category and humanitarian category both those sectors of the intake which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said we must continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have also pointed out on a number of occasions that the rebate system itself was capable of its own injustices because the <span class="highlight">family</span> rebate, as introduced in the famous Hayden reform, was most unjust on low income earners who did not have sufficient income to claim the benefit of the rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, that system has been changed to the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which does most to assist low income families, the people whom I hope, and I am sure, the honourable member would want to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Industrial action which people take at times in a most irresponsible way is likely not only to lead to their own ultimate loss of job opportunities but also to a certain reduction in the number of <span class="highlight">family</span> farmers who are able to produce sheep and cattle throughout this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It recommended further that the existing means test being applied to gross <span class="highlight">family</span> income did not adequately cover the capacity of the <span class="highlight">family</span> to contribute to the support of the tertiary students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore recommended that there should be a deduction from gross <span class="highlight">family</span> income of the income tax paid to allow for the variations in the proportion of tax payments with different income levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that recently the Government gave assisted passages to 2 members of the royal <span class="highlight">family</span> of Laos to settle in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and in terms of the criteria relating to the refugee operation, those people were eligible for assisted passages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that these people are of the Laotian royal <span class="highlight">family</span> in no way decides whether they are eligible for assisted passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add that the remaining member of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, a son who was at that stage in the Philippines, was also granted an assisted passage and travelled to Australia, I think, sometime in August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She had one simple thing to say to me and to the Minister, namely: ‘Thank you very much for what you have done for our <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Lebanese people in my electorate and on behalf of the many migrants, from Mauritius and from Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia, I thank the Government for the work that it has done to assist in bringing about <span class="highlight">family</span> unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consider the situation of a young person in rented accommodation living in a large city away from his or her <span class="highlight">family</span> and being out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be argued by the Government that the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will overcome that and that there is no need for adjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will deal with that later, but by and large people are not better off in real terms as a result of the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, why should a young couple in difficult circumstances, raising a <span class="highlight">family</span> with all the debts and liabilities that come at that stage of life and on a very modest income, be required to contribute a proportion of their income tax to pay the pensions of those people who, if they realised on their assets, would be in a handsomely adequate position? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principals might even employ their <span class="highlight">family</span> and pay very inflated incomes to them to avoid profit flow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A company might even get to the point of bringing in- and this may be probably quite unlawful but hard to detect- some system of kickbacks to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will cite the example of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to relate the point that I made earlier; that is, that people are better off because of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child will be $1.35 a week worse off as a result of the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children the indexed tax rebate with child endowment would have been $10.20 against a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance of $8.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a <span class="highlight">family</span> of this size is $1.70 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no adjustment to supplementary assistance and allowances, benefits for children or, most importantly, what is now called the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, or child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Oxley, who led for us in this debate, pointed out that every tax paying <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia is worse off this year because of the changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> would have received $4.85 net benefit during each week for the first child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children would have received $8.70 as tax rebate plus $1.50 as child endowment for the 2 children, a total amount of $10.20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they will receive $8.50 as a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for 2 children, a loss of $1.70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children would have received $13.05 as a tax rebate plus $3.50 as child endowment, a total of $ 16.55 compared with the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances of $14.50, a net loss of $2.05. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, the important point that people must realise is that there will be no indexation of child endowment or <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is desirable, if at all possible, that these children be kept in the atmosphere of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and not be institutionalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe there is a case to distinguish between people who are in an effective <span class="highlight">family</span> dependency situation and those who are not, but honourable members opposite ought to take on board the fact that a large number of young unemployed and sick people are very seriously disadvantaged as a result of the ommission of increases in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At some later stage that land will become urbanised and the pensioner, his <span class="highlight">family</span> or his estate, will get a windfall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that this House will agree that there must be no argument that the most significant change in the social security benefits area has been the amalgamation of child and student endowment into a single <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I believe that it is of utmost importance that the community, through the Government, provide assistance at the <span class="highlight">family</span> level for children requiring constant care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it should only be necessary for an applicant applying for unemployment benefit to prove that he has insufficient income for the maintenance of himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and that he is available for full time employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because my <span class="highlight">family</span> no longer needed my attention I decided to work one day a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-They will both pay the tax and as the honourable member for Corio points out they will both pay the tax at the fully <span class="highlight">family</span> rate if they have dependants, as many of these separated partners from a failed marriage do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to talk about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at a poverty scale concerning the period in which we were in government one will find overwhelmingly that most pension payments for individuals- the single person- for the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit of a husband and wife and for the larger <span class="highlight">family</span> units, including those with dependent children, were at or better than the poverty line by the time we had completed our term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not have this nonsense that the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system overcomes this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The table shows, for instance, that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child is $1.35 a week worse off, that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 2 children is $2.70 a week worse off, that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 3 children is over $2 a week worse off, that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 4 children is $2.65 a week worse off, and that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 5 children is $2.50 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the whole rationale behind the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  has said, I think the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme is a prime example of this approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme, which was introduced earlier this year, provides for the most massive redistribution of income in our recent welfare history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will help greatly to alleviate the circumstances of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Oxley spoke in particular about the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowances under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme were made available not only to taxpayers, as were the rebates under the Labor Party’s rebate system, but to all families with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, 300 000 families with 800 000 children will receive <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in circumstances where those allowances in no way replace a tax benefit, because they were not taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all aware that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme is one of the most significant changes in the social welfare system ever made in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found it necessary to make reference to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme as a whole to expose the dishonesty of the honourable member for Oxley in the manner in which he tried to deceive this House when presenting figures which implied that pensioners with dependent children - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The assistance includes meeting the fares, up to the value of approved economy class public transport costs, for the journey for the applicant to travel to the new area for employment or training or interview; for the applicant and spouse, if any, to travel to the new area for one exploratory visit to examine living conditions and return home; for the applicant and or his <span class="highlight">family</span> to move to take up residence in the new area; and if the applicant moves to employment ahead of his <span class="highlight">family</span> to allow him or her return visits to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Henderson report on poverty in Australia pointed out very forcefully the effect of inflation on the average <span class="highlight">family</span> and its effect on deprived families- families with real poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reverting to my former comment in respect of coal hydrogenation, is a matter of some urgency, and I have stressed many times in this House and repeat again the relationship of the three great members of the hydrocarbons <span class="highlight">family</span> solids, liquids and gases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded that the present legal aid allocation has been virtually eaten up by <span class="highlight">family</span> law problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that 80 per cent of the legal aid allocation in South Australia goes to <span class="highlight">family</span> law problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member would be the first to agree with me when I say that it is ridiculous to say that one should not have the right of an appeal from a summary conviction unless perhaps the responsible Minister approves and that one should not involve oneself in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters because they are deemed to be of a lesser priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I would like to compliment the Attorney on moving to establish the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and in seeking advice on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that already there are good reasons for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to be reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His intention was to impose the fee on every <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court application, not simply on those for dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has involved himself not in matters of esoteria but in matters pertaining to the people- legal aid and <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same comments apply to the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner the States adopt <span class="highlight">family</span> courts the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would want to send our good wishes to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My <span class="highlight">family</span> and many of my friends watch ABC television more than the other television channels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, where a <span class="highlight">family</span> with more than 4 children migrates to Australia the additional children can be accommodated at Fairbridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect Fairbridge plays a vital and extremely important role, because Commonwealth Hostels will not accept more than 4 children from one <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances the migrant’s greatest comfort and support is his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How inhuman it is to separate families at this time, when above all else, migrants need the  comfort and security of their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a good reason why Commonwealth Hostels will not accept more than 4 children from one <span class="highlight">family</span>, we in this House should know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be tragic if the Commonwealth Government was not willing to build on his example and achievement by removing this inhuman and anomalous practice of limiting Commonwealth hostel accommodation to only 4 children from one <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be implicit in what I have said so far, but I should make it clear, that the present Bill would in no way affect the functions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This imposes real financial and personal hardship particularly when, as is not infrequently the case, the property has been in the hands of the one <span class="highlight">family</span> for generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They therefore tend to be <span class="highlight">family</span> inheritances rather than an opportunity for anybody to buy into them and, as it were, start from nought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In estimating a program of 70 000 some consideration was given to refugee-type situations around the world and to the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What was then revolutionary in Australia’s treatment of disease was the idea that if a man was suffering from tuberculosis he could leave work, his <span class="highlight">family</span> would be supported, he would get a full income and, therefore, he would not be under economic pressure not to obtain treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not referring, of course, to motor car advertisements which depict a <span class="highlight">family</span> travelling somewhere in a motor car and which say that it is a particularly suitable motor car for <span class="highlight">family</span> usage and I am not referring to a <span class="highlight">family</span> group that is depicted in a barbecue situation using a certain product, but I am referring to some of the other things that I mentioned but a moment ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal error of government economic policy is that at a time of deep recession Budget outlays, excluding the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which are largely offset by higher taxation, are likely to fall by about 8 per cent in real terms during 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Garfield  Barwick had it wrong on one count; he objected in 1964 to the inclusion within the original jurisdiction of a Federal court of <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters or, as we then referred to them, matrimonial causes matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Attorney-General, by continually refusing to co-operate in negotiations with New South Wales, is denying the people of that State access to legal aid in Federal matters, and very importantly m <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were about the job of disestablishing the Australian Legal Aid Office we would not be increasing the budgetary figure; nor would we have introduced what might, on the face of it, be an unpopular provision, namely, the payment of a $60 fee per divorce application to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can be proved that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of less than $150 after tax, after meeting essential living expenses, rental on a present residence, providing for children, has insufficient left for savings, particularly to the degree necessary to qualify for the maximum grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I accept completely, and it is implicit in the Government’s proposals, that a company which is trading across State boundaries ought not to be in a situation where the attitude of the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs in New South Wales is different from that in Victoria, but surely one cannot apply quite the same approach when looking at a <span class="highlight">family</span> business which is simply carrying on its operations in one suburb of Melbourne or Perth or Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excluding <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which are largely offset by higher taxation, Government outlays are likely to fall by at least 8 per cent in real terms in 1976-77 compared with the previous financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, at the same time, those taxpayers have received the equivalent sum- all but a few dollars either way- in additional, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances as a straight transfer from tax to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As from I July 1976 the replacement of rebates for dependent children by increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances means that a child’s separate income can no longer affect, by way of reduction in concessional rebates, the amount of tax payable by the parent or guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand, however, that in determining eligibility for payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of a student child aged between 18 and 25 years, the amount of income of the student is taken into account in deciding whether the student is dependent on the claimant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Allowances have been increased substantially, by up to 40 per cent in the case of students who are independent of parental support; the limit of <span class="highlight">family</span> income at which the maximum allowance is payable has been increased and requirements relating to the student’s program have been eased where a student is unable to undertake a full study load because of course requirements or arising out of a direction by the student ‘s institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A more recent survey this year, to which I have previously referred in this House, that of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in Victoria in a survey of farmers in central Gippsland, showed that 65 per cent of farm families find it necessary to seek work away from the farm for at least one member of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will have personal consequences to the farmer and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and will flow through to the whole rural community- the shopkeeper, the supplier of rural machinery, the rate collector from the local municipality, the bank manager giving consideration to realisation of the bank’s security or considering deferment of payment of interest on the farmer’s loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable gentleman will well know, and I believe he will support, the decision taken to change the previous basis of child endowment payments to the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has come, as you  Mr Speaker  have indicated, from a <span class="highlight">family</span> which has traditionally served this Parliament and the people of Australia from the beginning of Federation in 1901. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet in the retirement of Norman Parkes and in the succession of the Parkes <span class="highlight">family</span> since 1901 when the Australian Constitution was implemented, there is the living testimony of the development of the Australian Constitution through the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medibank in its original form represented a positive addition to the material incomes, the living standards of every Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Allowing for taxation, including the health tax and social security payments such as <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the net income of such a person when Labor went out of office averaged $1 1 1.64 a week; today it has fallen to $108.54 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also we introduced a new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to take effect from 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, under this system the mother in a <span class="highlight">family</span> with 5 children receives a cheque for an amount of the order of $330 every quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the higher income group of people it is practically a line-ball situation; what is received in additional <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances matches what is lost through the abolition of tax rebates for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for people in the lower income group, where incomes are not high enough and insufficient tax is paid to take advantage of the child rebates, the amount received under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme represents a net gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention again our implementation of the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which is of such great benefit to low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cavanagh  in another place in relation to new sub-clause (4A) of clause 9, quite rightly drew attention to the fact that a person could have an article or object which had been handed down through the <span class="highlight">family</span> or which had been given to him by another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have suggested to the Victorian Government that in the case of towns such as Streatham, and perhaps Cressy where 18 or 20 houses were destroyed, if it were possible to get a project builder into the towns, or under a housing trust or the Housing Commission, the houses might be rebuilt much more economically through a large contract than through each <span class="highlight">family</span> having to pursue an individual contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law BUI was passing through Parliament in 1 975 the view was taken that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges should be required to retire on attaining the age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provisions were in fact included in the BUI to ensure that this is the position in the case of judges appointed to State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to that, it ought to be noted that the policies of tax indexation, the changed method of payment for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the tax cuts which come out of past decisions which will apply from 1 July and which come from tax indexation, materially affect total disposable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should not try to argue that it can cut real wage levels without it really affecting household disposable income because of what it has done by way of tax indexation and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which were largely offset by the abolition of tax rebates for children anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We may with propriety, with fairness and with justice claim that in the world today the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> in London are an example of dedication to duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are an example of perfect <span class="highlight">family</span> life that might well be admired and respected right throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel that it is reasonable to say that alongside the other great, important, powerful families in the world our Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> is outstanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that we should look back at those days from time to time and remember that we have before us a great example of dedication to duty on the part of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know full well that the great majority of worthwhile Australians, to whom I refer will be in favour of her and her <span class="highlight">family</span> and of this country remaining a constitutional monarchy in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, one of my colleagues has some <span class="highlight">family</span> problems and has had to leave the House unexpectedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme places in every mother’s hands an allowance to spend as she thinks is best for the welfare of her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that the Minister relaxed the entry criteria to allow members of the extended Lebanese <span class="highlight">family</span> to come to Australia with maximum speed and minimum discomfort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place the Minister obviously had no conception of what Lebanese regard as an extended <span class="highlight">family</span>- a concept which goes well beyond the Australian understanding of members of the immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> circle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is worried because, as most of us would, he finds the burden of supporting a <span class="highlight">family</span> here and dependants overseas an overwhelming load to carry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Lebanese community ask that the present policy which excludes a total <span class="highlight">family</span> from emigrating to Australia where one member fails the medical examination be altered so that only the seriously medically unfit members may be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately  Mr Abdulla,  an accredited courier for the South Lebanese Association in Sydney, was not only found to have urged nominees to mislay documents to confuse identity but also he deliberately deceived our officials both in Sydney and Nicosia in respect of his own sister and her <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member made great play about my not understanding the question of extended <span class="highlight">family</span> as evidenced by the Lebanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well understand the feeling of extended <span class="highlight">family</span> as evidenced by the Lebanese and other groups of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have left some of their <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Lebanese people have a tied <span class="highlight">family</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention as an example a man who went to Nicosia in October last year to see whether he could get his sister, her husband and their <span class="highlight">family</span> out to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this man was there he paid to a travel agent the amount of fares for his sister, brother-in-law and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He might like to know that on a number of occasions I have taken up with the Minister the question of what is to be done about one member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> who has been knocked back on medical grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, he is attacking the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Speech characteristically dwells upon the miniscule housing voucher pilot scheme and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which, it is worth noting, took money on the one hand from the bread winner of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and handed it back to the mother without effecting a cost to revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the man who moves to a new city or town, the <span class="highlight">family</span> that voluntarily travels interstate, the breadwinner who returns to work after disability or illness, the employee who resigns because of poor wages or conditions or to seek new opportunities, the person who quits work to care for children or a relative- no such person, whatever his or her needs, would receive any help from the community if he could not get work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Christmas- the man has a <span class="highlight">family</span>- the unemployment benefit was summarily taken from him on the grounds that he was not trying to seek work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is again recognised as the most important element in our society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still believe that our society and its integrity depend on the male wage earner- basically the single wage earnernot the 2-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that the same remarks could be applied to the Hohenzollern royal <span class="highlight">family</span> and to the Kaiser and his colleagues in 1914. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not their children or <span class="highlight">family</span> who will be exterminated if war breaks out again and if terrorists are allowed to return to the same areas and continue to do the same things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disposable incomes rose in real terms during the September quarter of 1976, revealing the effects of personal tax indexation and the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that his <span class="highlight">family</span> wants him to retire from political life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Baume),  a man who would have you believe that he is a decent <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For humanitarian reasons Australia has supported the reunion of immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in the present difficult economic circumstances, Australia has maintained a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy which provides for the entry, with a minimum of formalities, of nominated dependent immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> members and parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has naturally decided to retain the provision allowing a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a person on whom a Service decoration has been conferred to wear that decoration, provided he does not represent himself as being the person on whom the decoration was conferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing has been done about a special child care rebate for the single parent <span class="highlight">family</span> or the <span class="highlight">family</span> where one parent is an invalid yet it was promised in the policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time will shortly overrun the small business or <span class="highlight">family</span> concern on which the reputation for hospitality and service has been established within the northern tourist industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the very strong views that many migrants hold in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer then talks about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refers to the reform by the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that enables individuals and families to spend government financial assistance in the way that they choose, not in the way that the Government sets down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I would hope that in further consideration the Government would consider very carefully <span class="highlight">family</span> and fertility policies which can encourage a net reproductive rate to be greater than onegreater than zero population growth in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was done under massive new social benefits, social inducements, housing programs, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance programs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the complexity of factors  involved  in people ‘s decisions about <span class="highlight">family</span> size, the extent to which such government measures have affected, or could affect, the birth rate is difficult to determine with any confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the honourable member for Lilley was suggesting that population could be increased from the migrant content of the community when, in fact, I believe the migrant content of the community conforms in the main to the normal social attitudes that we take in Australia in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What other measures does he suggest for this stimulation of population growth through fertility and <span class="highlight">family</span> size? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where I think we are probably too rigid in our <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present policy makes it extremely difficult for extended <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the resources to house them, to give them jobs, to provide their children with education and to provide security to the older sections of the <span class="highlight">family</span> who ought to have proper reunion rights must be made available to those people, hopefully in <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of any stepping up of the immigration program on the basis of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions this will necessarily mean that because most migrant families live in Melbourne or Sydney there will be an increase in the population in those 2 cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> in Sydney is not going to bring out members of its <span class="highlight">family</span> and settle them in Alice Springs or in Broome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be doing whatever I can to arrange <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pointed out that when we apply the policy or choose one of these options we must have regard, as we have done, to the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion requirements, to the refugee component which has been mentioned by a number of speakers, to our diversified manpower recruitment requirements, to our retraining policies and to matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 111 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 enables regulations to be made making such provision as is necessary to enable the performance of the obligations of Australia under the Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance signed at New York on 20 June 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that, initially, after the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act commenced on 5 January 1976, the Attorney-General deferred the preparation of regulations under this section pending the determination of the challenge in the High Court early last year to the validity of major provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think people would be able to see a very real reason for and a great deal of common sense in having a retiring age forjudges appointed to the Federal <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, when I joined multicover, it was to cover myself and <span class="highlight">family</span> for additional out-of-pocket expenses that occur, at no time did I imagine or intend that I would be contributing to a doctor’s over award payment scheme . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The callous attitude of the previous Government towards the farmer and its deliberate attempts to destroy the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm have unfortunately planted in the minds of many, the question: Do we in Australia need a rural sector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was not able to join other members of her <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia because of that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the husband, because his wife chooses to stay at home to look after young children, takes overtime and earns $10,000 the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s tax liability would be $1,779. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s disposable income would be approximately $500 less than if both had continued in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Needless to say, I am concerned about the delays occurring in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that since the beginning of 1976 the numbers of applications received by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have been running at a much greater rate than those received under the Matrimonial Causes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the major part of last year applications for divorce lodged with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court were running at approximately 1000 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early last year I anticipated that the work load of the Court might well fall but it appears that since the beginning of this year applications lodged with the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have increased, and they are now running- without being completely accurate- at between 850 and 950 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will also be aware that at the present time judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court have to be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already 28 judges have been appointed to the Court and I am proposing to put recommendations to Cabinet soon for the appointment of another 2 judges to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will also know that the regulations under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act restrict to twenty-nine the number of judges who can be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am currently conducting a complete review of the judicial work load of the Court and of the need in the immediate future for additional judges to be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I want to stress that the solution to the delays occurring in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a real need for research to be done by those involved in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area as to the appropriate way in which this work can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, let me point out that the 2 judges attached to the Parramatta <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are doing as much work as are 4 judges in another part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures adopted in the Parramatta <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are different from those used in other courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, let what we have done be taken into consideration right now in wage deliberations, along with the new system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which has also operated since 1 July last year and which is of very great net benefit to some 300 000 low income Australian families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A couple of Government back benchers have moved a traditional motion or address thanking  Her  Majesty for the Speech from the throne and expressing pleasure at the presence of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housing for an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> in Arnhem Land, is different from the kind of housing that is required at Port Hedland, and the housing in either place would be completely irrelevant to the houses of Aboriginal families who live in the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not recollect having heard anything from the Opposition, certainly as regards praise, for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances that were introduced by the Government in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The introduction of television has had a profound impact on the patterns of <span class="highlight">family</span> interaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United States of America National Government has long recognised the impact of television on <span class="highlight">family</span> life and its largest single item in education outlays is now parental education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To those who believe that this Government has not kept its electoral promises and has not put this economy on the right direction, I say this: Within the constraints of our present economic situation, we have made a significant number of moves in the right direction, in the direction that will help not only businesses, but also the average wage earner, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man, the everyday citizen in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supporters of the Government stand up and prattle out parrot fashion what the Government has done in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances when in fact the Government has taken money out of the pay packet of the father and given it to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also pleased to see that the Government has decided to retain a provision allowing a member of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of the person on whom a Service decoration has been conferred to wear the decoration, provided, of course, that that person does not represent himself or herself as the person on whom the decoration has been conferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would go further in Labor’s great and historic concern for the disadvantaged, the underprivileged and the weak- in the primacy we give to justice and individual and <span class="highlight">family</span> security- women may have more to gain from a Labor Government than men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Say one had had one’s property stolen in The Lebanon because there was a change of government there and one went to Victoria and stayed with one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> for one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member is trying to draw too strong a line in respect of the freedom that the people who are resident in Australia have in taking an interest in the affairs of overseas countries, particularly when the country concerned is the one from which they have come and with which they have very close and very pertinent, sensitive <span class="highlight">family</span> connections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is compiling a list of sponsored nominees acceptable under <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with normal immigration procedures, this information is for internal departmental use only and is being obtained on a form used, where required, in cases involving <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the break-up of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit with <span class="highlight">family</span> members being spread all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to be too  blase  about finding some solutions to this problem because a lot of these courts are the physical arenas in which citizens come up against the power and the authority of the law, particularly laws passed by this Parliament, especially in <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, it seems to have provoked an attack on me as the AttorneyGeneral because of my administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just to put honourable members’ minds at rest, the fact is that because this building has been built and judges have moved into it, Temple Court, where the Federal judges have been for some years, will become vacant and very shortly those premises will be passed over to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and there will be eight or ten magnificent courts there to minister to the people of Sydney who find themselves embroiled in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this building has a direct effect on the people of Sydney and it enables us to get on with plans to put the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court where it was always intended to be- in a place much more suitable than that chosen for it by, if I might say so, the Labor Government down in George Street well away from transport, well away from the legal profession and in a place where very quickly the building became quite inadequate and people were forced to move to various parts of the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the construction of this building, and purely no doubt as a matter of coincidence in time, the fact is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be moving into better premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the torrid climate that has existed in the ATAC meetings where we have had State Ministers walking out and other Ministers accusing a Minister of not having had a marriage in the <span class="highlight">family</span> for many centuries, I suppose that is understandable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in regard to a statement made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions involving East Timorese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These restrictions would be by way of sponsored nominations which are acceptable under the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reform that was introduced last year, to change the basis of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, I believe, was probably the most significant single social welfare reform since Federation especially to help women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many women and single parents in the Australian work force and unless there are adequate child care facilities, in a great many cases children are not properly looked after when their parents, whether they come from a 2 parent or a single parent <span class="highlight">family</span>, are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While aged relatives may not have contributed through taxes they are an important part of <span class="highlight">family</span> and community life and the cost of supporting aged relatives of migrants is one which must be recognised and borne by the country inviting immigrant families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at domestic reforms: The public lending right, insurance deposits, Aboriginal land rights, Aboriginal councils and associations, the maritime college, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the simultaneous elections referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These humanitarian grounds principally relate to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions, refugee situations or other exceptional circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the unfortunate things that has occurred in the Western World in recent times is the necessity for the 2-income or 3-income <span class="highlight">family</span> because this prevents women who wish to stay at home and increase their families from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this extent I believe that the Government’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances system is very much welcome because it directs the money into the hands of mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it could be argued that these present developments might indicate a trend towards smaller <span class="highlight">family</span> size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present declining fertility rate, in my view, threatens the very existence of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and therefore the stability of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely governments can create a framework- economically and sociallywhereby it is more attractive for a couple to have a reasonable sized <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one compares the various income alternatives of a man working on average award rates, a woman working on average award rates and a couple with one income and the benefits and rebates accruing to their <span class="highlight">family</span> of, say, two, three or four children, there is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">family</span> group is disadvantaged in relation to the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think governments have a responsibility to provide a framework within which the decision by a woman to stay home and raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> should be encouraged and not discouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, to create a framework which does away with the disincentives to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> will be very costly and will take a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am trying to say is that she should not be discriminated against when compared with the woman who chooses not to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> but would rather work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our immigration program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those women who wish to raise a <span class="highlight">family</span> are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first case, if we follow that program we must have a very restricted program of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the medium option we can have a wider <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy and, in the third, we can have a very generous <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that our <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion program is far too restrictive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the source countries from which our migrants have come the <span class="highlight">family</span> means not merely a dependent parent or a dependent child but brothers and sisters and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those communities depend very much upon the extended <span class="highlight">family</span>, and when they want to nominate members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> they should not be prevented from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which we can assist them in having <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions as they understand them is to expand the migration program so that, in net terms, we are receiving something of the order of 50 000 to 70 000 migrants-a total settler intake of 100 000 to 120 000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way there could be many more <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  when he looks at this question to recognise that <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion is based upon humanitarian grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of people who wish to marry perhaps the numbers to some extent are self-regulatory because many of the people who have come here in the past have come here as <span class="highlight">family</span> units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to them and ask him when reviewing the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion program to have a far more relaxed policy with regard to the brother and sister and more distant relative situation to enable those communities which have large numbers of people in this country to have the same rate per 1000 of nominations as some of the other communities which have lodged a larger number of applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My <span class="highlight">family</span> came originally from the British Isles, mostly from Scotland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are pleased, happy and proud to have that girl as a member of our <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look at her <span class="highlight">family</span> as a fair example of the battle of people such as they in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Particularly in the <span class="highlight">family</span>-reunion category, a lot of dependent parents come to Australia and for quite understandable reasons find it beyond them to learn the English language at that stage of their life, especially given the fact that they live within a small <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any suggestion that we ought actively to favour those who do possess the English language now, no matter what their other personal attributes may be or what are their occupational qualifications and their <span class="highlight">family</span> connections in Australia, is I believe a backward step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence to suggest that the declining fertility or the trend for a 2-child <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia will, in fact, be reversed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated that we have international and humanitarian obligations in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions and particularly in respect of refugee resettlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most significant example of an incentive program is in France where extremely generous <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and other material incentives were provided by government to encourage people to have more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a child may be entitled to an allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme as well as the Handicapped Child’s Allowance if he is either undertaking an approved course of correspondence studies at home, or living with a relative to attend daily an institution for the handicapped because his <span class="highlight">family</span> home is too far from the institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the extent to which the applicant’s previous income and any other income the person or their <span class="highlight">family</span> are currently receiving should limit the level of income support during a period of unemployment; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am happy to say that the newspaper is still being published, but unfortunately the husband of the <span class="highlight">family</span> who was running it has since passed away and the newspaper is being published by  Mrs Rider-  Wood and an invalid son, who is the photographer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, if the Government were to extend the criteria in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, for argument’s sake say particularly in respect of brothers and sisters, the numbers of people who would instantly become eligible to come to Australia would expand very rapidly to the extent that a major proportion of the annual intake would be covered by people in the category that I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was a tragedy and a great national loss because the loss of <span class="highlight">family</span> security and cover could mean financial hardship for thousands of families should a breadwinner suddenly die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Life insurance meets a basic human need- the necessity to protect a <span class="highlight">family</span> against loss of income through old age and death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned previously, we can expect further legislation to be introduced which also will be of benefit to the industry and to the holders of the policies of these splendid life offices which mean so much to Australia’s development and to the safeguarding of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The presence of close <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships in Australia will be an important consideration when approving migrant entry cases, while a complete review of the existing conditions of entry will be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this approach, families who cannot afford even a modest standard of accommodation will receive a special housing allowance based on <span class="highlight">family</span> size and income and the cost of a standard house or flat in the local housing market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> will be required to pay a rent contribution based on a realistic percentage of income, and the housing allowance voucher will make up the difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone I have spoken to appeared to understand that, with the exception of the honourable member for Prospect who is incapable of recognising that it was not the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  who introduced the great social reform of getting rid of tax concessions of either kind for children and replacing them with this magnificent <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite obviously the benefits of tax indexation, together with increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, mean that it is quite reasonable to ask for some wage restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at those initiatives and at the easing of the distribution requirements to private companies, the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the automatic adjustment to pensions in Australia and particularly at the incentives that this Government has created, we find that Australians are being given back $2,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard any suggestion that  Mr Anthony  or members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> have acted improperly in any way because of their association with a former tenant- a  Mr Stallings-  as gross impropriety, particularly in view of the fact that not only was a full explanation of the tenancy agreement given but also copies of arrangements entered into by a real estate firm in Canberra, then known as Mary Thynne Real Estate and now known as Thynne Real Estate, were in fact laid before the House on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To have changed the text of  The Newcomer and the Law  when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was passed in mid- 1975 would have caused further delay and cost because of the considerable time required to translate, typeset and check foreign languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I make the point to the honourable gentleman who seeks at present to concentrate unduly on the subject of wages that he ought to bear very much in mind the objective criterion of the living standards of the average <span class="highlight">family</span>, the average worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After deducting a so-called ‘living allowance’ for the farmer concerned and for his <span class="highlight">family</span> and deducting something for regular commitments on advances which he had received the officers then took the balance and called this the rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worth noting that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances this financial year were significantly increased in the last Budget and are expected to cost $ 1,032m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the balance is spent on a range of services of a nature designed to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> and in particular to give expression to the Government’s wish to give child care to needy families where the children otherwise would be without care of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this occasion it has to be recognised that we need to be sure that the help that we as a government give to the Hughson <span class="highlight">family</span> is the sort of help that will best suit their immediate requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The arrival of these quads of course takes the Hughson <span class="highlight">family</span> from three children to seven, which qualifies them for substantial help from the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, because of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances children are no longer included in that aspect of indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to move into indexation in this field, surely we should also be moving into the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, although they are not yet 12 months old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 to fix a maximum retiring age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to exercise that newly acquired constitutional authority to prescribe a maximum retiring age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs brought down a report on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill, then before the Senate, that was responsible for the insertion in the Bill of provision for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recommending the creation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court, the Committee expressed concern that if it were a Federal court the judges would have to be appointed for life, because it felt that judges of a <span class="highlight">family</span> court should not continue to adjudicate when of advanced years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, arising out of this recommendation, an amendment was carried to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill to provide for the opportunity for the establishment of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this amendment, which is now section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, a State <span class="highlight">family</span> court created pursuant to this provision may not exercise jurisdiction under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act unless, amongst other things, judges of the court are to retire by the age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia, which has been established pursuant to section 41, have a retiring age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recognise that this requirement, having been approved by both Houses of the Parliament, provides a compelling reason for prescribing an identical retiring age forjudges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, now that the Constitution alteration has made this possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on a retiring age for Federal judges, which led to the Constitution alteration, specifically recommended 65 years as an appropriate age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the proposal to amend the Constitution to provide for the retirement of Federal judges was raised, and before the referendum on the Constitution alteration in May, the former AttorneyGeneral made known his preference for a retirement age of 65 years for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will also, of course, be well aware that 65 years is the maximum retiring age for the great majority of employees and office-holders in Australia, including the holders of non-judicial offices of comparable status to that of judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is generally conceded that in <span class="highlight">family</span> law, more than in most other areas of the law, judges adjudicating over disputes should be aware of and keep abreast of current social values and attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, and also because of the demanding and arduous nature of at least some of the disputes- notably, defended custody disputes- there seems to be good reason for requiring judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to retire at least by the age recognised as the maximum retiring age for most other occupations in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, this Bill prescribes the age of 65 years as the maximum retiring age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since all the existing judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill makes two other amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By virtue of an amendment earlier this year to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law (Judges) Regulations, up to six additional judges may be appointed to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had, with reasonable expectation of continuation of employment with its attached income, committed themselves to expenditure in the way of buying homes and motor vehicles and attending to all the requirements normally associated with the establishment of <span class="highlight">family</span> in an employment area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He does not come within the present guidelines for permanent entry- that is <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion or skills in demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I presume that  Senator Guilfoyle  s household has never had to survive for three or four weeks with no income and no money in the bank, unable to pay for the roof over the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s heads, let alone to put food in their mouths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any period the unemployment benefit is miserably inadequate, but in a period when hundreds of thousands of Australians are unemployed as a direct result of the Government’s policies, the least the Government can do is to provide a benefit which will allow the recipient and his or her <span class="highlight">family</span> to survive with dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these ways- together with other initiatives such as the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances scheme and the increase in the tax threshold, which will relieve many pensioners from the burden of paying taxation which was imposed on them by the previous Government- this Government has demonstrated its concern for the disadvantaged groups in society and has made sure that the cost of reducing the inflation rate will not fall on those groups who suffer mostly from the effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Society is prepared to act as a breadwinner in a fatherless house but is not prepared to finance adequately a household in which the father is required to give up his normal working duties to assume a dual parental role to keep his <span class="highlight">family</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More money in the pocket would not enable a <span class="highlight">family</span> to buy any of these things but without these amenities a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s quality of life is drastically reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without the control of inflation there can be no proper management at an individual or <span class="highlight">family</span> level or at a government level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A commitment of a certain amount of money a week will provide the necessities and the luxuries with far less strain on the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has said that there should not be restraint on the capacity of individuals to establish their <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He knows, as we know, and as honourable members opposite are starting to find out as they read the Budget documents and the facts start to filter through to them, that it is a fraud, that nobody in Australia except people in the higher income groups will be better off and that because the Government has not indexed the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance people in the lower income bracket will be worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Asprey Committee pointed out that the law at present does not cover benefits given to an employee’s <span class="highlight">family</span> and that clearly these benefits should be taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They should talk to some members of the broken families who are now unable to get work, where husbands and wives have separated because the <span class="highlight">family</span> income has dropped so low they cannot meet commitments and they have no prospect of getting work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House expresses its regret at the death on 12 September 1977 of Leslie Clement Haylen, a member of this House for the Division of Parkes from 1943 until 1963, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his <span class="highlight">family</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To his wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> I extend my very deep sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At some odd stages he had a nostalgic idea of buying back the <span class="highlight">family</span> property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I send this message to his <span class="highlight">family</span>: We in this House who remember him and those of us who have taken an active and interested part in politics in the last  30  years will remember him, although it is  14  years since he retired from this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, in addition to its <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and refugee policies, will continue to recruit overseas those people whose qualifications are both acceptable and needed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these is the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances replace the previous tax deductions for children, in the interests of equity they should be indexed against inflation as other tax rebate items have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> is crucial for nurturing children and providing a stable psychological environment for their development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in that list of unfulfilled needs the Government should keep these things in mind as having top priority: Relief to beneficiaries, following the loss of a near relative, by the abolition of death duties; the needs of people outside the capital and provincial cities who live in uncongenial climates and who face inflated living costs and who are the real decentralisers; these people should be given realistic encouragement by means of an expanded zone allowance; the needs of taxpayers who suffer many anomalies such as paying tax on rent from a residence where the rent paid in a situation of job transfer is not tax deductible; the needs of taxpayers who are selfemployed and who receive no encouragement to superannuate or to insure themselves as employed persons can do; and the need for mothers to have their <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance indexed to equate payment with the dependency tax deduction forgone by the parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen from the statement that the transfer covers a wide range of important functions such as primary industry, child, <span class="highlight">family</span> and community welfare, payroll tax and stamp duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is between $40 and $50 per year per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While he is there he says: ‘I know from <span class="highlight">family</span> history that I might suffer from gall bladder complaints in a couple of years’ time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the very personskely to have private resources, either owned personally or within their <span class="highlight">family</span> units, that will allow them to meet the gap between the rates and their statutory contribution and the average fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have quite a lot of people in the higher income area with fairly high capital assets in their own name or in their <span class="highlight">family</span>’s name who have chosen to insure privately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct his attention to recent reports in the media about visits to Australia by members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> known as Barbaro. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether there have been any applications to him for permission for Domenico Barbaro or any of his <span class="highlight">family</span> to visit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sought advice from my Department in relation to this request and, consistent with the strong advice it had provided successive Ministers in relation to these members of this <span class="highlight">family</span>, I decided not to grant entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the relative disadvantage of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> where one parent works and the other looks after the home and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where many families now have two bread winners the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> feels under great pressure to bring a second income into the <span class="highlight">family</span> to maintain a comparable standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the two income <span class="highlight">family</span> contributes to increased national productivity it also adds to the community costs in some important respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of both parents from the home leads to increased demands for child care facilities and welfare services which are provided as a matter of course in the traditional one income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am finding increased concern in my electorate that present taxation and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance provisions do not give significant acknowledgement of the social and economic role performed by the full-time home maker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system introduced last year was a significant social reform but many of the social welfare activists in our community have not given sufficient credit to the Government for that reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It put additional funds into the hands of large low income families where the help was most needed, but in a period of inflation when prices and wages are still rising, when taxes are subject to indexation and social security pensions are indexed, the relative values of those <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances declines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from dealing with this problem of the declining value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the Government- indeed, the whole Parliament- should consider ways of correcting the relative disadvantage of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be done by a variety of taxation mechanisms or by the provision of an allowance for a full-time home maker added to the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one vital area which this Budget has given support to the <span class="highlight">family</span> under stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purchasing power of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net effect of reduced real wages and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the tax changes will be to cut the purchasing power of our incomes by several dollars a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the low income earner with a large <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Government’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system has provided the greatest boost for very many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that each time another migrant <span class="highlight">family</span> is brought here work is created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Mr Grassby  ‘s activities are beyond reproach his <span class="highlight">family</span> and he deserve to have the heavy veil of current .public suspicion lifted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the average <span class="highlight">family</span> of husband, wife and a couple of children this means an increase of income tax of $936 yearly since the Fraser Government promised to reduce taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year it introduced what it called a revolutionary system for helping the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s halo in the area it calls ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> reform’ is beginning to show distinct signs of tarnish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Fraser Government made a rather more radical change to <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes which it hailed, with typical modesty, as ‘one of this country’s most significant social reforms’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It didn’t increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to allow for the effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government continues to misallocate resources in its provision of health services by failing to increase funds in areas which put the emphasis on health maintenance; for example, the community health program, drug education, the school dental scheme, <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to his comment on the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It changed the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was a complete revolution in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When will the Opposition understand that a national Budget is like a <span class="highlight">family</span> budget- if one continues to spend more than one raises, the results will eventually be disastrous? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes a pensioner- a person who has worked a lifetime for this country, lived through a depression, fought through a war, raised a <span class="highlight">family</span> of five- to put it so simply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These measures coming on top of the new scales of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have been a great benefit to families in the La Trobe electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A glance at the figures reveals the fact that a Labor Government is anti-<span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Fraser Government scheme a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children now receive $14.50 each week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I demand a full and independent inquiry into the operations of the Deen <span class="highlight">family</span> and Hall and the activities they have been undertaking over a number of years to find out why my inquiries into the matter were not investigated some 4 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a full, open and independent inquiry into the whole of the operations of the Deen <span class="highlight">family</span> and Hall and the system of warrantee rights over pensions can clear the air of this hideous manifestation which revealed itself in my electorate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and questions of citizenship, dual nationality and passport issue are all involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of a <span class="highlight">family</span> travelling by car from Newcastle to Sydney to visit relatives they could ring them on the videophone and see them as they spoke to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact which transport costs have on the household budget of the average <span class="highlight">family</span> is shown in figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on household expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are actual costs and not percentages but they give a clear indication of the greater impact which transport costs have on the low income <span class="highlight">family</span> compared with the high income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same sized <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $340 per week spends $38.42 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the high income <span class="highlight">family</span>, which receives more than four times the income of the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>, spends on transport only a little more than twice that spent by the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the same sized <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of more than $340 per week pays $34.16 per week, an increase of a little over 50 per cent in the transport cost component although this <span class="highlight">family</span> has an income more than four times that of the <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of under $80 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both in the area of the private motor car and the commercial vehicle, I would like to see the Government lump together the road maintenance tax and all of those taxes into the petrol tax or the fuel tax so that when the owner of the <span class="highlight">family</span> car sits behind his wheel on his way to work or on his way to some entertainment he knows the real cost he is paying at that moment to drive that motor vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More than 1,000 Lebanese still have applicatons registered with the Embassy to emigrate to Australia, most of them being in the context of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now seeing the most extravagant and most irresponsible use of government aircraft to fly members of the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">family</span> to the opera, of all places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tasmanian Government and a number of people down there- the Von Bibra <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Ross area, for example- are doing an excellent job in making that State more attractive to not only Australian tourists but also overseas tourists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in order to fix a maximum age for judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia Honourable members will be aware that this Bill was introduced in the Senate and that it passed that place without amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in two areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting point about this legislation is its provisions relating to what is known as a non-party matter, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the matters to which they addressed their minds was the creation of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this matter was debated in the Senate on 26 November 1974  Senator Missen  moved an appropriate amendment on the basis that if we created State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts we then had a chance to guarantee a retiring age for judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we now enter this field appropriately as we are entitled to do under the Constitution and have a federal <span class="highlight">family</span> court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It became virtually a legal fiction that because we had to get judges of the right calibre and have an ability to retire them we would create State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at section 41 (4) (b) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act we see where State courts are created there is an opportunity to negotiate an agreement which guarantees that people appointed by the States shall not hold office beyond the age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice there is a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also notice that no other State has a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the decision in  Russell  v.  Russell  we are somewhat defective in being able to grapple with all the <span class="highlight">family</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very severe problems for a <span class="highlight">family</span> and they are the <span class="highlight">family</span>’s own problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that under the Constitution if we could get States to refer to the Federal Parliament powers in those areas of property, maintenance, custody and what have you, we would not have any difficulty in dealing with the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a fiction to think that under the Constitution we have the power to deal with marriage- as we have- with divorce, matrimonial causes and parental rights and that those powers have to be interpreted, as the High Court has legally said, but those matters are limited to the aspects of the <span class="highlight">family</span> which I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested on the basis of what was best for the <span class="highlight">family</span> in its time of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the stupid situation at the present time that while one is able to go to the <span class="highlight">family</span> law court to discuss problems between husband and wife, one has to go to another court to discuss problems which relate to property and to another court if the matter relates to the custody of the children who have been part of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court made an order for the right of the former wife to have occupancy for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a question of a <span class="highlight">family</span> problem and a <span class="highlight">family</span> court decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could put another constitutional amendment and ask the people whether the <span class="highlight">family</span> law court should have the ability to deal with all matters relating to the <span class="highlight">family</span>, virtually unanimously all people in Australia would say yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took us about 77 years to obtain one minor amendment, and we cannot afford to wait another 77 years to deal with the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> which I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some problems now which relate to the administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law is reasonable, the interpretation of it is understandable and the question always has to do with a tragic circumstance, usually the break up of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has to deal with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that the basic unit in society is a strong <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and that is to be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have created in all honesty and sincerity and, I think, in a rather well-meaning way, a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court concept which not only has the judicial concept but also has the counselling and assistance concepts to help people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in the last Appropriation Bill we appropriated for <span class="highlight">family</span> law $ 1 1 m but we spent only $6m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Treasury has saved $5m in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is great trouble and concern there because in matters where there are disputantsfamily disputes are the fiercest of disputesthe margin for reconciliation and negotiation is not wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been the problem of trying to get the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court well established in a proper atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should luce to see a committee set up to look at how the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is operatingwhat are the problems, the advantages and the weaknesses and what areas need to be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must guarantee that these solutions are available virtually at the time the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is involved in order to avoid the situation in which, although we can solve the problem of separation, the very burdensome problems of custody, maintenance or property rights are not solved for a period of up to two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in suggesting that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court could undertake this function; that would weaken the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the chief judge in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court area should be the  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also involve counsellors and people interested in <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare concepts, such as social workers, and even representatives of <span class="highlight">family</span> units, so they can determine what they can do together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We emphasise that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court concept has been a non-party one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be done by providing better support facilities for the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the best of which would be a job for the wage earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">family</span> crises which are in no way related to temperament or conduct; they could be related to economic circumstances, such as poor housing, poor environment, or lack of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to provide the right facilities to enable the talented people in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area to function efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, at the appropriate time, the Government might consider setting up an inquiry into how best to improve the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act or its administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to encourage Federal <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak in favour of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all honourable members have agreed, as this Parliament has agreed and as the people agreed in the referendum which was passed it is desirable that <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court judges should retire at the age of 65 years, I believe it is important that additional appointments should have been postponed until such time as the appointments can be made on this new basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important points that have been made already is that judges of the Western Australian <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court already have to retire at the age of 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need forjudges involved in this area to be people who are able to adopt a contemporary approach to problems involving the <span class="highlight">family</span> which come before courts, which in so many ways are unique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been mentioned already, there are considerable delays in the hearing of matters in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it ought to be noted that there has been a substantial change in our law with the introduction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division some five judges previously were able to deal with all the matters relating to the complex law which my colleagues will tefl me previously existed in relation to the establishment of a cause of action to enable the court to dissolve a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court which is taking over not only the matters that formerly were dealt with by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division in New South Wales for instance, but also many of the matters that previously were dealt with by courts of petty sessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pace at which we have moved has meant that many of the matters that previously were dealt with by courts of petty sessions, such as those relating to maintenance, custody and so on, now, under section 46 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, are required to be transferred to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In cases in which there is a dispute involving custody, guardianship and access to the children of a marriage, or property exceeding $1,000 in value, the matter must be transferred to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, unless the parties agree to the matter being determined in the Court of Petty Sessions or in a court of lesser jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a delay occurs, such as is the case now in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, there is a distinct possibility that a party who otherwise might agree to a matter being heard by consent before a court of petty sessions would say: ‘I wil get an advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There might be a two-year delay before this maintenance matter can be heard by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, whereas the Court of Petty Sessions might make an order in favour of my former spouse’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that, while we are having these teething difficulties in establishing a <span class="highlight">family</span> court system of the size and adequacy that is necessary to deal with all of these matters, we ought to look at ways and means by which we can involve the State courts of petty sessions in dealing with and determining some of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the matter which the honourable member did not pursue and the one which I think quite rightly should have been pursued- I believe that it was being pursued by the previous Attorney-General until it became too late to contemplate such a change- was the establishment in the remaining States of State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, if there were State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts exercising Federal jurisdiction, those courts would have the power to determine matters arising under State jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I supported strongly- I believe that that support has been vindicated- the amendments moved by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made the point, quite validly- this has been brought out very clearly in the debate today by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith as well- that we do not remove from the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area generally the conflict that can arise in marriage in relation to matters of property, maintenance and custody of children simply by removing the allegation of fault in the breakdown of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, with extra judges and extra personnel, is still having to deal with the same complex and difficult problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say here and now that I do not believe that we will help the situation in Australia by the development of a very complex and large <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that in New South Wales in the old <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction a certificate from the Registrar stating that certain technical matters had been dealt with was sufficient to satisfy the judges in the old <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Division that those matters had been completed satisfactorily and that the paper work was in order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have been aware that those problems might have occurred as a result of throwing out entirely the old system, instead of looking at ways and means of developing it to overcome some of the specific problems that existed in the minds of honourable members when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill came before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding my comments about the problems faced by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and those associated with the development of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, I am pleased to be able to support strongly this Bill which will enable additional judges to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may go a long way towards overcoming the problems that are facing the <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support strongly the proposition put forward constructively by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for a committee of inquiry to be set up as quickly as possible to study the means by which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court can be made more efficient and more effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Parramatta should acknowledge that one of the frustrating difficulties in this country at the moment is not only in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law but is equally in the area of corporate law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While one acknowledges the regrettable number of deficiencies in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- they are deficiencies which I would strongly point out- they cannot be attributable to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sets out concisely the problems in relation to custody under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When parents separate and cannot agree about the care of their children, the law usually refers to the problem as a dispute about ‘custody’, a word which has overtones of the prison rather than the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formerly, the father was the child’s guardian, but since the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which came into force on 5 January 1976, both parents are guardians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the very onerous difficulties facing the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- we have often overlooked this in Australia, particularly since the Second World War- is that one third of all marriages in Australia during the last  2Vi  decades have been between people born in Australia and people bom outside of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court officers estimate that SO per cent of their inquiries are from Australian couples with different ethnic backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not take much to envisage the immense problems this creates for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These tug-of-love situations, if I can call them that, place great pressures not only on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court but also on the Foreign Affairs Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of my concern about child abductions and the difficulties that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court faces I wrote a lengthy submission to the former Attorney-General and I shall make some reference to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area which has frequently been exploited relates to a passport under which a child or children may be lawfully taken out of the country on a passport that may have been obtained by one or other of the parents some time before proceedings in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court has the power to request the surrender of foreign passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the intervening period the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court could notify the foreign embassy or consular office of the court order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, when court orders are made in relation to custody or access there is no transmission of this information from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to the Foreign Affairs Department or appropriate consular office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be a greater notification of decisions made in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to the Australian Foreign Affairs Department which issues passports and is responsible for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I said earlier, I think there has to be a greater exchange of information between the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the Foreign Affairs Department when court orders are issued particularly when they affect foreign nationals or rather those who have dual citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This might be more the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs although it stems from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also stems directly from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final matter to which I draw the attention of the House is that of interstate abductions and the execution of warrants under section 64 (9) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another ludicrous anomaly to which my attention was drawn-this is one of the strictures on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court- is the confidentiality provmons which apply, certainly in the Social Security Act and, as I understand it, in the Repatriation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had two cases drawn to my attention in which a parent obtained through the Social Security Department the address of a spouse who had defied the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court order for custody and abducted the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The name in turn was transmitted to the Department of Social Security through the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, but the Department of Social Security refused to furnish the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court with the address of the offending parent so that the warrant could be executed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this is another factor that must be extremely frustrating to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and to the people in these situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me sum up by saying this: Undoubtedly, in this area, along with many others- particularly in this area in which so much human distress and tragedy is involved- there is an urgent need for the States to realise that if the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is to remain effective and efficient there must be urgently a rationalisation and unification of laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that an age limit of 65 years is fixed is an indication of a parliament’s judgment that there is, in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, an appropriate age at which judges ought to retire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in going on appointing judges, even to the age of 65 years, let alone for life, simply to meet what I believe is really a temporary contingency in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will add considerably to the work capacity of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was always a basic part of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court concept that there would be counselling services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that 36 judges ought to be sufficient to cope with the work of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, and one would hope that the additional judges would be appointed within the next 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court premises around this country are the most magnificent court premises in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  to know that the Temple Court building in Sydney is to be used by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facilities at Scandia House were provided to the Government when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act was implemented in January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not talk about <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court premises in a derogatory way, because they are ideal premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested I think in June in an address in Adelaide that a parliamentary committee to inquire into the operations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act ought to be established next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has to provide the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases some other gentleman comes along and lives in the <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that these problems necessarily can be avoided but a sense of hardship and injustice is being bred in the community in relation to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> has become a less popular institution in our society but it is one that we need to underpin in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are too ready to take off the shoulders of the <span class="highlight">family</span> those responsibilities which traditionally belonged to it and put them on the shoulders of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This transfer is not helping the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is becoming a less significant unit in society and that people are looking more and more to the state for support instead of to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking not only of an enforcement body to operate within the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court area but also of one to act in other areas such as the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Conference took as an example of a perfect law to adopt our own <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We increased the private company retention allowance from 50 per cent to 60 per cent; provided for indexation of the valuation of trading stock; dramatically restructured <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; removed disabilities in farmers entitlement for unemployment benefits; abolished the property component in deciding eligibility for pensions; and adjusted for automatic adjustment of pensions for movements in the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have explained to the other shareholders, I am quite prepared to accept the responsibility within that <span class="highlight">family</span> group and I will exercise that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increases in benefits flowing from the fees increases determined by  Mr Justice  Ludeke should result in increases in <span class="highlight">family</span> contribution rates of up to 35c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Were this allowance that I am suggesting to be part of a <span class="highlight">family</span> income it would be taxable and this would ensure provision according to <span class="highlight">family</span> need which is more equitable than provision according to institutional need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to reinvigorate the world we live in and to renew society and I believe that this means putting as much real power as we can into the hands of ordinary people, especially power over their own lives and over the things which concern them most deeply, like education and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So many of us are so far away from our school days that we have forgotten what a scary time it can be between 17 and 18 years of age faced with the prospect of going out into the world, having to start a new job, a new life, a new career away from the security of <span class="highlight">family</span> and parents, having to perform in a quite different way from the way we performed at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Medibank element were excluded and any other indicators were used- there are four or five of them available and they could be made known to the honourable member if he wanted them- they would show that disposable <span class="highlight">family</span> income had increased to a certain extent during the last year as a result of the totality of our taxation policies, our policies in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, and all the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to extend the Lands Acquisition Act to the external territories and, as has already been pointed out by honourable members in this debate, to acquire land to set up a quarantine station in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands which was obtained, if my reading is correct, for virtually nothing by the Clunies Ross <span class="highlight">family</span> before the turn of the century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time that the States exercised their responsibility and allocated greater proportions of funds into the area of childhood services, not merely into child care or pre-school education but into services to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> in order that children can be brought up by their families and given appropriate care and education so that when they do start school they can begin their formal education without disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member will recall that in the recent Budget under the <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine program the Government announced an incentive scheme for young post-graduate general practitioners to encourage them to go to rural areas to practice at least for a period in the hope that they will settle in rural areas and thus help to overcome some of the manpower shortage that exists in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, concerns an answer given by him during Question Time yesterday in which he claimed that only by using the full consumer price index, including the Medibank element, as a price deflator is it possible to demonstrate a drop in total disposable <span class="highlight">family</span> income during the last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After reading through the speech he made in this House on 22 March 1977, I should like to know whether perhaps he wants to tail down the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion aspects of our immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some <span class="highlight">family</span> groups, few in number I am pleased to say, nave arranged for unrelated aged people who are expected not to live for any length of time, and who have little in the way of assets of their own, to set up multiple ‘shell’ trusts under a will for the benefit of members of the sponsor <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look back to the days of the Labor Government when we saw a redirection of every resource and a willingness of the Government to involve itself in every activity of an individual’s way of life, whether it was a corporate individual or a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a tremendous breakthrough when this Government gave massive increases of money by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to the poor people, to the people who really need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of that number the Roy Morgan Research Centre found that 70,000 people were the main breadwinners in a <span class="highlight">family</span>, not the 300,000-odd people whom the honourable member for Gellibrand would have us believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think they themselves have lost $2,000 and obviously their own <span class="highlight">family</span> finances will be very much behind as a result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Turning to the estimates relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law, I commend the Attorney-General for his statement that there will be a parliamentary committee to investigate the operations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that legal aid, in proportional terms, has basically gone to people who are involved in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that more than 80 per cent of the legal aid vote in fact goes to <span class="highlight">family</span> law cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I and others have said that there is a great need to work out in this area some sort of lump sum fee that will, in effect, mean that the legal aid vote for <span class="highlight">family</span> law will be spread amongst more people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that legal aid has been sent off in specialised directions and that many people who have ordinary cases of litigation are excluded from receiving it if they are not covered by such provisions as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that mean that if there are people in the Attorney-General’s Department whom the Government wants to move sideways for some reason or other can be made a judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The matters which I wish to raise concerning the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are of the utmost national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the criticisms I intend to make of the working of the Act are very damning and worrying and ought to be of the gravest public concern, they are m no way a reflection upon the present Government or upon the administration of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act by the present Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  or his predecessor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be acknowledged that some fundamental mistakes were made when this Parliament passed the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that while the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act remains in its present form with all the imperfections that can occur in the adrninistration of justice, some very tragic miscarriages of justice are likely to occur simply because of the way in which the Act was ultimately passed and because of the lack of consideration of some of the points that were made in the debate on the legislation when it was before Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have become much clearer with the considerable delay that is being occasioned in New South Wales in particular as a result of the large number of cases that have to be dealt with and the propensity of litigants in <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters still to want to have the questions of custody, maintenance and distribution of property dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales she has that right under the Testators <span class="highlight">Family</span> Maintenance Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recommend very strongly to all legal practitioners and to all litigants who are at present exercising their rights under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that parties be not prepared to accept a decree of dissolution of their marriage until a court is also able to hear the ancillary questions of maintenance, custody and the distribution of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the problem has been exacerbated by our writing out of the <span class="highlight">family</span> law system in Australia the courts of petty sessions which have so expeditiously dealt with so many matters that are now ranting before the <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That matter might be helped if we were able to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to give courts of petty sessions jurisdiction to handle these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Attorney-General has today made additional appointments to the <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts in Australia I do not believe this will overcome the problem I am speaking of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it has to be looked at in the context of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ‘whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill (a) contains changes to the personal tax system which are regressive in nature and which will have little effect in stimulating economic activity, (b) repudiates the Government’s commitment to full tax indexation, (c) fails to take measures to alleviate the increase in <span class="highlight">family</span> tax burdens which have arisen as a result of the Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, and (d) contains insufficient measures to counter tax avoidance practices ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1976 Budget, the Government introduced the system of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to replace child endowment and tax rebates for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This in itself was a worthwhile reform and was welcomed by the Opposition, although we did not want it done at the expense of so many deserving people who lost the <span class="highlight">family</span> tax rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to add insult to injury, failure to index those <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances has meant a relative erosion of <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 1975-76 system of tax rebates and child endowment had continued and if the child rebate had been indexed in line with other rebates, thousands upon thousands of taxpaying families, the vast majority- in fact all on $240 a week or less, which I believe constitute about 80 per cent of tax-paying families- would be better off now than under the proposed tax scales we are now debating, plus the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disadvantage under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system varies from $1.80 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child to $5.30 for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme praised by the Prime Minister as one of the greatest social reforms of the post-war period is largely a cleverly disguised tax rip-off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course  Mr Gittins  was referring to the fact that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have not been indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This comparison reveals that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children and an income of $200 a week will be over $6 a week worse off as a result of this Government’s tax changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child and an income of $400 a week will be over $7 a week better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The practice where some <span class="highlight">family</span> groups arrange for an unrelated aged person who is not expected to live much longer and who has little in the way of assets to set up multiple ‘shell’ trusts under a will to the benefit of members of the sponsor <span class="highlight">family</span> is to be curtailed by bringing such estates under the scope of section 99a, This closes a loophole which existed in antiavoidance legislation passed in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants to take great virtue in what it calls indexation but it has quietly forgotten to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that one of the promises that will be tossed up in this election by honourable members opposite will be that the Government, as from 10 December, has decided to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the average <span class="highlight">family</span> consisting of a husband, a wife and two children, this means an increase in income tax of $936 yearly since the Fraser Government promised to reduce taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s halo in the area it calls ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> reform’ is beginning to show distinct signs of tarnish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Fraser Government made a rather more radical change to <span class="highlight">family</span> incomes which it hailed, with typical modesty, as ‘one of this country’s most significant social reforms.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It abolished child rebates and instead significantly increased the rates of child endowment payments, which it renamed ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> allowances.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It didn’t increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to allow for the effects ofinflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Committee that the Labor Party has been right in criticising the Government for its failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, but I think it has been wrong in attributing to the Government a hardness of heart on this aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 976 the Government said that it would change the method of income tax rebates and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances so as to help the people in the community who were worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet now, while nearly everything else in the Income Tax Assessment Act is being indexed, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should reinstate the allowance for children at a figure which would compensate for the change in price levels which have affected the real values of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this amendment will be that there will be restored, in addition to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, an income tax rebate in respect of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That income tax rebate, at $50, is just about the amount that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances have been short changed by the rise in prices and the failure to adjust them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternatively I would regard this as a better course of action- the Government here and now should say that before the Parliament rises for the election, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should be adjusted in line with the change in prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> situation, such as it exists m those cases, will obviously benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I find particularly unpleasant is the fact that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance stops when the child leaves school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children have been entitled to a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, depending on their position in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, of at least $3.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other children then move into other positions and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance drops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be a sudden drop in income of $1 1 to $12 for that <span class="highlight">family</span>, which is probably a very large proportion of the total income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cite the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> where both the husband and wife have been working and it would be a very low income <span class="highlight">family</span> if only one person was working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With both the husband and wife earning something of the order of $150 a week, the total <span class="highlight">family</span> income would be approximately $300 a week, and probably around $260 a week after taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be a quite reasonable income for that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a hell of a blow for that <span class="highlight">family</span> and I am sure that none of us could survive for any length of time on that sort of income without drawing on our capital resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that in some ways it contradicts some of my other arguments about school leavers, but I invite honourable members to compare the income of that <span class="highlight">family</span> with the relatively high incomes of people such as ourselves who possibly have working wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one of the children reaches the age of 16 or 18 years and leaves school, and after a period of six weeks has not found a job, that <span class="highlight">family</span>, provided the child is under 18 years, will receive $36 a week, and if the child is over 1 8 years the <span class="highlight">family</span> will receive, I think, $49.30 a week even though there is a parental income of $500, $600 or $700 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in the sense of two spouses with a total income inasmuch as one or the other is entitled to a benefit, but the children are not taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely people here can see that possibily there is something wrong with our approach in the situation which I was talking about before, where a couple whose incomes drops suddenly from $260 or $280 a week to $140 is entitled to nothing, but the other <span class="highlight">family</span> with no drop in income at all and with a boy or girl still at home, as he or she has been for the previous 18 years, will get from the state $49.30 a week I think it is, in unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we believe, as I do, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> has the main responsibility for socialising the next generation, is an important agent for social control, and provides a unique opportunity for the satisfaction of emotional needs, it should be understood that an incomplete <span class="highlight">family</span> is likely to find it more difficult to carry out these functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can thus be argued that if the community is prepared to take the responsibility of breadwinner for a single mother then it should also take the responsibility for the provision of a substitute mother when a father is prepared, at all costs, to keep his <span class="highlight">family</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make one point quite clear on behalf of the Labor Party and honourable members on this side of the Parliament: Under no circumstances do we accept that the Government, in spite of its majority, has a mandate to extend proverty, has a mandate to extend unemployment, has a mandate to extend <span class="highlight">family</span> breakups, or has a mandate to promote greater drug dependence in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can find similar impressive achievements in the area of social welfare: <span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances, the supporting parent’s benefit and the indexation of pensions and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Husband and wife can work together for many years to buy a home and raise a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the affluent ones who in many cases have been putting 200 or more cattle in the name of each member of thenfamily so they can multiply this benefit accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are six members in the <span class="highlight">family</span> each with 200 or more head, the <span class="highlight">family</span> receives $12,000 instead of the $2,000 that a small operator might receive from this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An analysis of the data at that time- admittedly a broad analysis in terms of rates of taxation on average weekly earnings, forgetting certain social factors such as <span class="highlight">family</span> size and so on- illustrates this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever our problems with unemployment, we must always accept <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion as an undeniable ground for migration to this country for those Australians, new or old, choosing to reunite their families here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I launch into a discussion of the real issues let me say once again that, in calling for migration to be cut to the bone as happened under the Labor Government, we did not discourage <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and we did not stop political refugees seeking asylum in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say that explicitly because I have been misinterpreted and people have felt that I was saying that there should be no <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rely on memory as to the content of that statement but succinctly the reasons were: Firstly, that Indonesian control is effective and covers all major administrative centres; secondly, that it is necessary to press on expeditiously with the question of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion; thirdly, that it is necessary to do the same with the rehabilitation of Timor; and fourthly, that to carry out the last two matters in particular we need to have more extensive direct dealings with the Indonesian Government as the authority in effective control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is evident by the number of marriage break-ups, <span class="highlight">family</span> break-ups, et cetera, that are occurring in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> and friends often are not able to provide much assistance and the problem must become a community responsibility in order to minimise the changes forced upon the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My <span class="highlight">family</span> recently placed an advertisement in the  Land  newspaper and in the Goulburn newspaper for a farm manager and, in the entire readership of the Goulburn district and in the area covered by the  Land  newspaper, there were five applications for the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a report tabled in the Parliament today it was acknowledged that of all our institutions the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the most influential in terms of human relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">family</span> has a high standing in our social and political rhetoric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most lament the deteriorating state of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Western society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main focus of the report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships sees the principal purpose of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as providing for the care and upbringing of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been stripped and is still being stripped of many of its functions- its responsibility for the education of young children; its responsibility to provide the socialising experience for young children; its role in the past as a productive unit; its functions and responsibility to be the unit that conveys social values to young children; and its responsibility to provide to its members some measure of economic security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these roles have been taken away from the <span class="highlight">family</span>; yet Australians want the <span class="highlight">family</span> to have an increased responsibility in the areas to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In debates on social policies, the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a social unit is often lost from view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments generally ignore the existence of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their approach to the <span class="highlight">family</span> has been one of laissez faire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is an urgent need to develop a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was most encouraged that those of us in the community and in the Parliament who have been urging that something be done in this direction were able to read today in Volume 4 of the report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships that the Commission is of the view that the Government should initiate a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a nation we have been failing the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a conscious <span class="highlight">family</span> policy we leave a great deal to chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for Australia to have a positive and coherent approach to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Competition between the individual and the state and concentration on self-fulfilment have resulted in the <span class="highlight">family</span> being left out of the public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Movement in this direction will continue unless the needs for the <span class="highlight">family</span> are recognised, and recognised urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has come for us to embrace values more supportive of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If preachers are not to be believed, and politicians are not to be trusted and society as a whole is a jumble of lies and tricks then the <span class="highlight">family</span> may still be the best bet available and may be even better than being liberated into loneliness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of regret and deep concern that government policies have rarely taken account of the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed policies often have an impact contrary to the interests of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wages, taxation, education, employment, social security and many other policies are and should be used, in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ‘to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing number of twoincome families makes it imperative that we decide whether women with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities should be able, if they so wish, to remain within the home to bring up their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These policies must ensure that the standard of living of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with children and a single income does not compare unfavourably with that of twoincome families and of single men and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances has been welcomed by some people as an essential start to a <span class="highlight">family</span> support system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and adequate parent allowances are provided, those mothers who wish to look after their young children have no choice but to seek paid employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the tax rebates for dependent children were superseded by increased child endowment payments which were renamed ‘<span class="highlight">family</span> allowances’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of continuing inflation <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were not adjusted last year and, though indexed, the tax rebate was not increased to remove the tax disadvantage of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should not use the fixed money value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances as a means of raising additional resources to provide for other needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes account of the movement in prices one would see that there was a saving to the Government last year of $ 1 1 4m as a result of the failure to adjust <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should apply to itself in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances the principles it has applied in the area of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wants to reduce the real value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances it should do so explicity and not by allowing inflationary movements in prices to erode the value of those allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indexing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances at their present levels would not provide families with the support that they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia we are a long way from the optimal tax treatment of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We tax the individual and give limited recognition to <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities through tax rebates for dependent spouses and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present our tax system is neither equitable nor neutral so far as the <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax now payable by a single income two-parent <span class="highlight">family</span> is substantially greater than the tax payable by two individuals each earning half the income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in many instances the additional tax burden placed upon the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> is more than $600 a year or $10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies to a <span class="highlight">family</span> where the mother is providing support for her <span class="highlight">family</span> and children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some would argue that the household economies available to a <span class="highlight">family</span> make the heavier tax burden on the <span class="highlight">family</span> justifiable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also many two-parent families with two incomes pay less tax on the same aggregate income than a single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax liability on families, especially those with young children, should be independent of the proportions in which the income is received by the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the view that we must identify what Australians want as <span class="highlight">family</span> goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only then will other policies be analysed to ensure that they are not inconsistent with the attainment of these <span class="highlight">family</span> goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that Government proposals are reviewed from the point of view of their effect on <span class="highlight">family</span> life, we should do what many have urged and what the Royal Commission on Human Relationships has recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should require that all Government legislation that is likely to have an effect on the viability of families is subjected to a <span class="highlight">family</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sum up my remarks this evening in this way: I urge the Government to initiate a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want it to convene a conference on families to assist in the development of a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also urge the Government to require all Ministers and all departments to prepare <span class="highlight">family</span> impact statements so that the effect of decisions by those departments on <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances can be properly analysed and taken into account before final decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should recognise the urgent need both to index and substantially to increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This survey concentrated on heads of households, predominantly males, so the figures are likely to be worse for other <span class="highlight">family</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggests that we should- I think I am using his words- cut immigration to the bone but in doing so we should continue the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and refugee categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that we should have fewer unskilled and semi-skilled people coming to Australia but that at the same time we should maintain the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and refugee categories which are the only categories under which some unskilled and semi-skilled people are being admitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present intake is made up of 29 per cent in the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion category; 10 per cent in the refugee category; 6 per cent approved on compassionate and humanitarian  — ,.~.A~. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest concern that is expressed to me by my constituents as I walk around talking with them is the breakdown in <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My electors are also concerned about the <span class="highlight">family</span> law as it exists at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot necessarily be blamed on the <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the endemic problem may have existed for years before that law came in, but the new <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has enabled marriages to break up easily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most unfortunate and terrible situation that a wife can walk out on her husband, leave him with two or three children, go off with somebody else and then a very short time afterwards divorce proceedings can be instituted and carried through, resulting in the compulsory selling up of the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and the division of the proceeds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is a complete failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not we will have more and more <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdowns, and my files and the files of other honourable members will be filled with stories of unhappy people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say at the beginning that, although I often disagree with the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr),  I agree with him that <span class="highlight">family</span> life is essential for the fabric of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank my wife and <span class="highlight">family</span> for all the help they have given me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the <span class="highlight">family</span> man and the working woman, majority of Australians, live under these conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make one point quite clear on behalf of the Labor Party and honourable members on this side of the Parliament: Under no circumstances do we accept that the Government in spite of its majority, has a mandate to extend poverty, has a mandate to extend unemployment, has a mandate to extend <span class="highlight">family</span> breakups, or has a mandate to promote greater drug dependence in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the two-child <span class="highlight">family</span> is the standard, and that is insufficient even to maintain our present population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The platform and philosophy of the Government parties strongly emphasise the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a cohesive force in society and as one of the most important elements in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does take into account the effect on the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a number of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, a number of its policies have been designed quite specifically to enhance the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, the supporting parents’ benefit and the new policies of” expanding the domiciliary care benefit and helping those families which have a handicapped member, which are designed to relieve the additional burdens on the parents of handicapped children so that their financial costs will not be greater than those of parents who have normal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance those policies to emphasise the importance the <span class="highlight">family</span> does take in our thinking and the development of our policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 131 recommendations of the Commission on the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation will receive particularly keen examination by the Government and, I hope, also by the public at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member for Sturt does well to draw attention in particular to those elements of the report designed to enhance the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the wellbeing and status of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believed that he had earned the right to serve this nation quietly, at peace with himself, at peace with the nation, at peace with his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir John  Kerr, once having discharged his duty to the nation under the most difficult circumstances, has no wish to continue as the centre of public dispute, making it impossible for him and his <span class="highlight">family</span> to live the normal life to which we are all entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the feelings of my wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>, who with me have had to withstand the vilification and attack for pan of my term as Governor-General, and now in prospect through a term as Ambassador to UNESCO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be an ambassador, constantly pilloried, constantly in the public glare, who had his <span class="highlight">family</span> placed under intolerable stress, was something that he did not want; he deserved better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a booming <span class="highlight">family</span> participation sport and it has enormous tourist attraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the arguments that take place, it does not matter whether the national wage hearings are quarterly, half-yearly or annual: If real wages continue to be cut in the way they have been in the last two years, if petrol prices continue to increase in the manner in which they have increased and continue to be ignored by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being relevant to the cost of living increases that ought to be passed on to wage and salary earners, if the Government continues with its threat to abolish Medibank and thus thrusts up health insurance costs by what we believe will be about $ 1 9 a week per <span class="highlight">family</span>, there will not be any consumer led recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the people who moved into the second car <span class="highlight">family</span> field, particularly at the end of the 1960s and the early 1970s, became consumers of the small imported car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not care how much you are earning, what sort of car you like or how large is your <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This one man dynasty is worthy of being ranked with the Bonapartes, the Harmsworths and the Coles <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done that by the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, tax indexation and the new standardised tax system which began operating on 1 February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that through his <span class="highlight">family</span> trust- it is quite legitimate- he has commercial interests in Canberra and the passing of this legislation would be in his interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the full implementation of a federalist policy will help to bring people together in the old sense of <span class="highlight">family</span> and village. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told by church leaders that the consequences of the present intolerable numbers of registered jobless will be <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown, child abuse, mental and physical illness, alcoholism and, again, crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> on average weekly earnings- which are about $205- with repayments set at 25 per cent of income, could borrow about $2 1 ,000 at the permanent building society interest rate of 12 per cent, to be repaid over 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A half per cent drop in interest rates would enable this <span class="highlight">family</span> to borrow about $21,700, an increase of $700. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A house is the biggest single investment or expenditure item in the lifetime of any <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an important item to that <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to receive a housing grant for a <span class="highlight">family</span> dwelling the bread winner’s income, excluding overtime, must not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a serious burden for a farming <span class="highlight">family</span> to have to go into debt as a result of incurring the losses which are now so universal throughout the rural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt now that there is a serious risk of many farmers and <span class="highlight">family</span> business people being in a situation where they will be seriously disadvantaged financially as a result of those arrangements and the curious approach by the Taxation Commissioner, although these duties are now being removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any person so detained is held incommunicado and therefore denied access to <span class="highlight">family</span>, legal advisers and independent medical practitioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either we take those additional taxes from the rich and poor alike, which is clearly regressive and which will bring about a situation in which we are taxing a large <span class="highlight">family</span> with modest earnings to provide a pension for a wealthy widow who is quite capable of attending to her own needs, or we tax the rich alone- we would have to tax them at very high levels- in order to hand the moneys back to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should we perhaps be looking hard at means testing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The impending and long overdue abolition of Commonwealth probate and estate duty will not only be of great advantage to the entire nation but also will lift forever from the shoulders of small businessmen, <span class="highlight">family</span> operations and primary producers an intolerable yoke and burden which has weighed them down for far too many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second stage of the promised abolition, which relates to all duties on estates of persons who died on or after 1 July 1979 and on gifts made on or after that date, also will be of very great significance to the Australians who have an interest and a desire in the field of private enterprise to sustain a business or to sustain a <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprise of some kind which would otherwise face the strains and the dilemma of finding funds to keep it operative after a deathperhaps an unexpected death or that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even during that election campaign we found that his time was somewhat taken up in investigating <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It certainly creates problems in their <span class="highlight">family</span> life if they do not have understanding wives and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The enrolled families would also be required to submit biweekly health reports to the project, i.e., brief questionnaires that collect information on use of health care, self-perceived health status of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and other indicators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary estimates suggest that the unit cost of each <span class="highlight">family</span>’s enrolment in the project would be the sum of the average premiums paid for health insurance at the moment plus whatever additional benefits are included in each Experimental Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present financing arrangements for health costs, patients often do not give any more real attention to the expenditure of, say, $9 on the provision of professional services for themselves or their children than they would give to spending $9 on going to a McDonald’s restaurant with the <span class="highlight">family</span> for an evening meal rather than having it at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an unfortunate thing, because the provision of health services for a <span class="highlight">family</span> is one of the most serious expenditures that any <span class="highlight">family</span> should approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third point with which I find a great deal of disagreement is the canvassing of the so-called deductible system where contributors may be asked to pay a certain fixed amount of the total medical costs for an individual or a <span class="highlight">family</span> for the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the concern in the community arises from the level of contributions being paid yearly by individuals- that is, the <span class="highlight">family</span>- at a base of $300 for contributors to Medibank and, of course, some $400 to $550 for contributors to private health insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that contributors, particularly the young Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>, look at the number of times they attend doctors in a 12 month period and relate the number and cost of consultations to the annual contribution they must make to Medibank or the private health insurance fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, this is a government whose leaders have openly admitted that they have <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, which are nothing more than tax avoiding arrangements, and whose ex-Treasurer, whilst threatening to take action against taxation avoidance, was revealed to have been minimising his tax liabilities through the device of a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the Prime Minister of the country openly advocating the use of a device to reduce income tax by sharing business income with members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and to reduce estate duty, is it any wonder that tax avoiders have felt free to go hell for leather? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Prime Minister, do your private <span class="highlight">family</span> companies and private <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts have the effect of lowering the rate of income tax that you pay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is right that I should make a declaration of pecuniary interest, for as one of those who is moderately well off, I should say exactly where I stand with regard to these sorts of schemes and retrospectively I have no pecuniary interest of any kind, nor does any member of my <span class="highlight">family</span>, in any of the schemes that are now before the House or will come before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we want confidence, if we want predictability in business, if we want to sustain democracy, if we want to ensure that those methods which protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> interest are upheld, we must not introduce retrospectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is to be a Government of low taxation, it must be a Government that looks at the taxation loopholes and tries to plug up the inequitable ones in order to cut down on the taxation paid by the average man in this country who we believe should be allowed to make a quid for the benefit of his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child would have received $5.30 a week under our system even if the level of child endowment had not at any stage been increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children would have received a tax rebate, which is no longer available, of over $9.60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances introduced by this Government are $3.50 for the first child and $5 for the second child, making a total of $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children the loss is $3.40 a week, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of four children it is $4.45, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of five children it is $4.75 and for a <span class="highlight">family</span> of six children $5.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both of these gentlemen acknoledged during the last election campaign that they have <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts; so we have right at the top of the political tree in this country people, including also the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch),  who have <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts which exist to avoid income tax and estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The individual circumstances such as <span class="highlight">family</span> income, assets and standard of the home will be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only is there a financial burden on a <span class="highlight">family</span> but, as many in the community will know to their cost, the unexpected death of a small businessman can often mean that the business is severely disrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disruptive effects of death duties on <span class="highlight">family</span> farms are also equally deplorable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the general <span class="highlight">family</span> situation, that deprivation once caused by the loss of a breadwinner and heightened by the imposition of death duties on assets left for the support of children is now gone forever- at least while the Australian Labor Party Opposition remains where it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the root of the opposition of honourable members opposite is their failure to appreciate the importance of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have protected pensions from inflation by indexing them to ensure automatic increases every six months and we have greatly increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommended restructuring the rates so that the tax bite would increase with the scale of property interests held, and recommended exemptions to exclude the weight of the duty falling on the spouse and <span class="highlight">family</span> firms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not taken into account the fact that in the last couple of years alone this Government has introduced a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system and full indexation of taxation in Australia and that it brought about tax cuts as recently as last February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arguments might have all sorts of merits but when one gets out into the country areas and has to face up to the harsh realities of seasons and to the fact that a <span class="highlight">family</span> must sell half its farm and finish up with an uneconomic unit because of the incidence of death duties and estate duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussions of the effects of estate duty, it is sometimes said that people who have been building up assets for years should not have their efforts undone by death duty, forcing the <span class="highlight">family</span> to sell up the assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everything was sacrificed to retention of the homestead and the land around it, and when estate duty falls due it has to be sold and the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit disturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of farming people have been to see me in my office in my electorate of Hume in recent years and- I know that my National Country Party colleagues found this as well- were literally distraught at the prospect of having to break up their <span class="highlight">family</span> holdings which they have had for years and which they know will finish up being uneconomic once those sales have been made in order to raise the revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion about combining incomes of husbands and wives and calling upon each for half of the tax is one of various forms of <span class="highlight">family</span> unit taxation that have been canvassed from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observations by the Asprey Committee about <span class="highlight">family</span> unit taxation is one aspect of its report that the Government has yet to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the children can be secured for a particular program -for example,  Blankety Blanks  on Channel 0 rather than the ABC news- this may set a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s viewing pattern all night unless the parents are very strong willed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the report of the recent meeting of Federal and State Ministers on 2 1 April was not more expansive; but it would seem that at this meeting there was agreement about continuing support for migration, that programs should extend over longer periods rather than that there should be an annual intake approach; that more emphasis should be placed on the English language as a criterion for entry; that there should be greater assistance to enable skilled workers to travel to Australia, and that restrictions should continue to be placed on people entering under the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion category, as well as the monitoring of people- whatever that means- of differing ethnic background, and limitation of the inflow of refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Australian Government needs to face the problems associated with, on the one hand allowing <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion policies to operate in a way which allows the consolidation of existing ethnic <span class="highlight">family</span> structures, and on the other hand allowing a proper response to the humanitarian needs of an increasing number of refugees wishing to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It really is quite extraordinary when one considers that the Treasurer, having announced that he is going to close all these tax loopholes, in reply to a question asked the other day by my colleague from Western Australia, the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins),  said that he would not agree to closing that extraordinary rank of the tax loophole of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those occasions gave one a different picture of the man in his <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was not without some familiarity with personal physical suffering, and in his <span class="highlight">family</span> life from time to time he was subjected to great stresses that were tragic in their nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also had to sustain his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I hope that you will convey my comments to Dame Pattie and to  Sir Robert’s  <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was with great satisfaction that he would have witnessed his own <span class="highlight">family</span> growing up and expanding, the growth and the development of his grandchildren and his <span class="highlight">family</span> embarking upon a road of distinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the present member for Kooyong I naturally wish to be associated with the motion and to confirm again my sympathy to Dame Pattie and the Menzies <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The influence of his <span class="highlight">family</span> in developing an interest in and finally an ambition for a political career must have been significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognised a lifetime of public service and the loyalty and personal sacrifice of this great man’s wife and <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I refer to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not easy for the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a public figure to share that public figure with the nation, but I thank Dame Pattie and his son Ken and daughter Heather for allowing the nation to share their sadness and to pay tribute to its famous son last Friday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pattie and to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of Ballarat I wish to join the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  and other speakers in expressing our sadness at the passing of  Sir Robert  Menzies and extending to Dame Pattie Menzies and her <span class="highlight">family</span> our deep sympathy on their loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Robert  Menzies’ <span class="highlight">family</span> lived in Ballarat for many years, his father being a coach painter at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> has lost a husband, father, father-in-law and grandfather. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add my deepest sympathy and prayers to those offered to Dame Pattie Menzies and her <span class="highlight">family</span> at this time of sorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Attorney-General ‘s attention been drawn to the article entitled ‘The law and artificial insemination with donor semen (AID)’ by Dominica Whelan, barrister-at-law, <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia, in the Medical Journal of Australia of 14 January 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Primary Industry has advised me that when he became executor of his father’s estate, upon examining those matters he immediately commissioned inquiries into the affairs of a number of <span class="highlight">family</span> companies in which three <span class="highlight">family</span> companies were involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out also that in the past two years there has been effectively a reduction in average incomes for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> and what they can spend in real terms of about $12 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had the bad luck to have any member of my <span class="highlight">family</span> enter a hospital or need to undertake expensive medical treatment, in fact the Government would subsidise any medical expenses I had by an amount between 48 cents or 60 cents in the dollar, depending on what tax rate I was paying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first relates to an extraordinary thimble and pea trick- the Government’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever a thimble and pea trick were played on the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> man and woman it was done by his Government when it decided to cut out the tax rebate for dependent children and introduce <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are not indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for a person with one child is now $3.50 a week, instead of the 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person who received previously a tax rebate as well as a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance- the tax rebate would have been continually indexed- today receives only a fixed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and accordingly is much worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I say it is a thimble and pea trick which the Fraser Government played upon the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> men and women of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have the ultimate, the question of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  asked whether the Treasurer would legislate against <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer gave the extraordinary reply that <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts did not amount to tax avoidance, they were merely tax minimisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has to pay every penny that he owes, but those with wealth can form <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, those with wealth can buy a farm and average their income, those with wealth can utilise Norfolk Island as a tax haven and avoid paying taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this is that involved in these swindles of the Australian purse are prominent members of this Government, particularly in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, and I refer to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the former Treasurer and now Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch),  and the  Deputy  Prime <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It estimates a surplus for almost every service used by the ordinary <span class="highlight">family</span> person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> in Victoria named Bloom is involved with the Portmans company which is about to take over or has already taken over Buckleys and Nunn Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of example only, let me suggest two possible opportunities: If a very reasonable income test were to be applied to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, it could save revenues in the order of no less than $500m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can reasonably object to three judges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia being members of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Justice Elizabeth Evatt, of course, was a member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when she was appointed  Chairman  of the Royal Commission, but by the time the report was presented she was Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax payable, reduced by <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in respect of the 2 children, would be equal to approximately 12.4 per cent of the taxpayer’s taxable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased offences mean an increase in the number of prison visits, arrangements for bail and legal representation, attendances at hearings, communications with <span class="highlight">family</span> and, if the person arrested is imprisoned, a continuing interest in his or her welfare, sometimes for many years, under arduous prison conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have indexed social security pensions and we have introduced <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if there is a chronically ill person or persons in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, they can insure by gap insurance and that will not mean much greater hardship to those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the low income families and the pensioners with whom I take it the Opposition is concerned, we find that there is no difference in the case of pensioners and only a small amount of difference in the case of the low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us examine the effect this will have on the ordinary or low income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The low income <span class="highlight">family</span>, if it wishes, can remain in Medibank Standard and the change will have absolutely no effect on those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preference is given to those who show farm management skills but are unable to acquire a farm or additional land from their own ordinary commercial credit or <span class="highlight">family</span> resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence lessees, sharefarmers, managers, second and subsequent sons on <span class="highlight">family</span> farms, et cetera, have preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rent they are prepared to pay is far in excess of what a normal <span class="highlight">family</span> could afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A single income <span class="highlight">family</span> finds it extremely difficult to purchase a home in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without exception, people who have been interviewed regarding their <span class="highlight">family</span>’s requirements and the requirements of the community for housing listed certain matters as of importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more power over one’s life and a pride in one ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span> if home ownership can be brought about by any mechanism which is open to governments, whether it be by the instrument we have before us today or whether it be by instruments which are available to the Government through economic measures or any other measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowdays new home ownership is increasingly restricted mainly to the top 30 per cent or so of income earners, families with two incomes acceptable to lending institutions, and those people fortunate enough to inherit money or a substantial share in a <span class="highlight">family</span> home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past two and a half years three Ministers have resigned, one has been sacked, one has been suspended, one is the centre of an inquiry involving the operations of two <span class="highlight">family</span> companies and alleged misappropriation of some $250,000, another has impaled himself on the public admission that he might have lied to the Parliament, while yet another has lost clear and obvious control of his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Why did a land speculation company offer such an extraordinarily generous deal to the Lynch <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, a deal which covered the cost of the trust’s investment after only the first stage of a three-stage program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been changes to company tax law, changes to stimulate mining, investment and development in this country, and there has been the historic social reform of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, something the Labor Party never even thought of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> owns a house the members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> virtually have some independence, some little castle, as it were, to which they can retire secure in the knowledge that no one can knock on the door and throw them out in the street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, through its financial assistance to the Royal Flying Doctor Service; the community health program; the Mobile Dental Clinic under the school dental program; the encouragement to graduate doctors to practise in rural areas under the <span class="highlight">family</span> medicine program, is endeavouring to improve the access of health services to people in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides that, commencing in the 1978-79 income year, where a child of a divorced or separated couple would, under the existing law, be taken to be a dependant for levy purposes of both parents, the child will be taken to be a dependant solely of the parent who is paid <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My attention has been directed to that criticism, and I should point out to the House that when taking that decision in Budget Cabinet, the Government did have in mind circumstances where, as the result of trusts and other income-splitting devices, children received separate income while their parents continued to receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What on earth gave substance to the belief that those people who sit on the back benches, spineless as they may be, ought to support a measure that would send public servants, acting as policemen, around this country to see how much money children were earning, so that if they were earning over $6 a week the mother could be fined by way of a reduction in her <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few people seem to be aware that, on a constant basis, servicemen are required to move with their families from place to place throughout Australia, often on a two-yearly basis, thereby disrupting home life, <span class="highlight">family</span> life and the schooling of the children and thereby causing the onflowing effects which appertain in relation to the wellbeing of the children, their development and growth and their capacity to cope with the educational system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of service is notable even in the fact that simple things such as motor vehicle licences can be a great problem for a <span class="highlight">family</span> moving from place to place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have given time and training, dedicated their lives to important areas of our defence and sacrificed many <span class="highlight">family</span> pleasures and enjoyments that the average citizen benefits from in order to take part in a fine and proud career in the service of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who are worse off are: The weak and unorganised, the poor, the retired, the small businessman and the farmer, the school leaver, the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who is paying more of his wages in tax than ever before in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its effects are not just confined to the person unemployed, but they are felt throughout the whole structure of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, the Prime Minister takes a different view, based on the barbaric philosophy that the jobless should be punished for their unemployment, the more so if they have no <span class="highlight">family</span> ties to sustain them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is not indexed, although the rebate scheme it replaced would have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is to be reduced to offset a child’s income from such sources as the tertiary education allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The capital gains tax we propose would exclude the <span class="highlight">family</span> home and normal possessions, including a car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would act positively against the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as devices for tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that one of the Government’s motives in changing the terms of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is to stop tax cheating through the use of these trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have just indicated, we would remove the means test on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, to hammer the point home, there are indirect taxes which, added together, might cost the average <span class="highlight">family</span> another $ 10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That $ 10 a week has to come out of a minimum income of $120 or $130 which has to look after a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is happening while the lower income <span class="highlight">family</span> struggles to get the marginal dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition tried to disparage what the Government had done, but the fact is that the Government’s measures will substantially reduce the cost of health insurance for the typical Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for perhaps half or less than the current maximum health insurance levy of $300, on a <span class="highlight">family</span> basis, Australian families will be able to receive the benefits that are currently provided by Medibank Standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would, however, reiterate the statement of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  this afternoon that, in respect of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, it was never the intention of the Government that the part-time earnings of the newspaper boy- children generally showing a bit of ‘get up and go’ and earning something for themselves in part-time work- should be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To most Australians the two cores of their lives have been the <span class="highlight">family</span> and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> has been the nuclear one, not the Italian style or Japanese style extended or threegenerational one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With many Australians in later years, as the <span class="highlight">family</span> disperses, work may well become the dominant core in males lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sufficient time will be allowed for Australians to investigate the new proposals and to see which scheme suits their pocket and <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not have to observe particular religious practices to believe that a funeral service has a legitimate role in the expression of the grief of a <span class="highlight">family</span> on the death of a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have interviewing skills, a knowledge of literature, and so on, and they can bring those skills to bear in performing an appropriate ceremony which expresses the grief of the <span class="highlight">family</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, if people feel some cultural need to have a ceremony to accept a child into the <span class="highlight">family</span> and formally give it a name, I do not see why that service should be denied to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the removal of the tax deduction claim in respect of home mortgage interest payments and the indexation of pensions only once a year instead of twice a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was indicated to us at Question Time yesterday that no longer will pocket money of news boys- the income they earn from selling papers- affect the amount of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance received by their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The next heading I mention is <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the six month period the Government hoped to save about $90m by reducing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payable to parents of children with a separate income above $312 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have an over-estimate by about $80m of the saving associated with means testing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like before leaving this subject of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to draw attention to the fact that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and other Government spokesmen have said that they did not want this means testing of children’s income to affect people whom they did not have in mind when they drew it up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would remind everybody that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was a substitute for a taxation concession, the dependants’ concession, which was itself means tested with a ceiling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the attitudes adopted has been that we should not be emphasising who was to blame; rather that we should try to emphasise the best way of solving the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> following the separation for a period of 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if that aspect were examined it would be found that it is not related to the question of guilt; it is related to the inability to agree on the terms of separation of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with regard to property, maintenance and custody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am anxious that we concentrate on how we can best solve the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span> with less legalism and at the minimum of cost and how we can support the parties in coming to an agreement in advance on the property distribution, the maintenance problems and the welfare of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, it also established the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia as a specialist court to administer the law, and provided the opportunity for States to establish State <span class="highlight">family</span> courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rough edges of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, it could be said, were ironed out in the two amending Acts passed in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned a few moments ago, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act marked a conscious change of basic principle in a number of areas of matrimonial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I think it is fair to say that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act aroused wide expectation that the conduct of parties would not be examinable in proceedings under it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, I think it is equally fair to say that sceptics of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act were confidently predicting that the provisions for counselling, unless at least given the force of compulsion, would prove largely ineffective in preventing bitter disputes or increased <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdowns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the features of the <span class="highlight">family</span> courts that few deny is the tremendous help counselling has been in the settling of proceedings which might otherwise have become protracted contested cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the success of counselling has exceeded the expectations of even the strongest supporters of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act have not operated as expected might not, in itself, be sufficient reason for submitting the operation of the Act to a parliamentary committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members may be wondering whether the establishment of the committee is necessary when the Act already provides for a <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council with the stated function of monitoring the operation of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that the committee, when established, would find it helpful to consult the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council, particularly in relation to recommendations it has already made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me conclude by paying tribute to the tremendous efforts of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia since their establishment, in coping with the work of administering the large volume of applications filed under the Act, particularly in its early stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already mentioned the success of counselling under the Act and this must be attributable, in the case of counselling in the course of proceedings, to the commendable efforts of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court counsellors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel confident that the committee will not fail to be impressed by the dedication and professionalism shown by the people who make up the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act when before the House was the subject of a non-party debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to speak to clause ( 1 ) of the proposal to establish a joint select committee to inquire into and report on the provisions and operations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later point I will discuss the actual composition of the committee, but I think it is important to note that the members of the House of Representatives will be involved in this discussion and consideration of the provisions and operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subparagraph (iii) deals with the organisation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and the conduct of its proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-paragraph (vi) mentions the services provided by counsellors attached to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts and approved voluntary marriage counselling organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I accept, in general terms, that the committee would have an ability to look at this matter, for the same reason as we have detailed other matters that ought to be looked at I support the general proposition that the committee ought to look at the effects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act on the nature of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important when considering an Act that goes under the title of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and has such a marked effect upon marriage as an institution and the <span class="highlight">family</span>, which are very important to our society and which are the basis of our society, that we know the effects of this legislation upon marriage and be prepared to act with courage if we find that it has a detrimental effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us ought to be prepared to look at it because we regard it as being a fundamental question and we want to know if the Act is not operating to support the <span class="highlight">family</span> structure that we regard as so important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned specifically the wide expectation that conduct of the parties would not be examinable in proceedings under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst many people thought that by removing the traditional fault principles under which our <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act had operated previously we might be able to relieve the court from examining the domestic affairs of the parties to a marriage, I was not one who supported that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation when you are dealing with custody of children becomes an important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My electorate is served by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Parramatta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have looked at the experience of the Parramatta Court have indicated that they regard the counselling that has been undertaken in that court as being admirable and constituting an example that other <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts might follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to deal not with the specific legal matters that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council has said require review- I draw the attention of honourable members to the reports of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council because I think that they highlight many important dilemmas, some of a legal nature and some of a more practical nature, associated with this legislation- but with some very practical aspects of the legislation that I believe this Committee when it is set up will have to look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to relate that specifically to a matter that I raised in a debate on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act in this Parliament on a previous occasion, that is the consequence of delay, and the consequence of delay linked with the fact that the dissolution of marriage and the ancillary matters were separated by this Act so that the dissolution could take place at an early date and the ancillary matters could be looked at at a later point in time, instead of being linked to be solved by the Court in one fell swoop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the delay is now so long in some of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts that a situation is emerging where people will be divorced- that is, the marriage will have been dissolved- and all the rights that go with marriage including the right of the widow to bring an action under the Testators <span class="highlight">Family</span> Maintenance Act can very easily be lost if the procedure in relation to ancillary matters has not been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wife would thereby not be able to get an order for the handing over of assets or for maintenance, both of which would secure her position, and she would lose because of the dissolution of marriage, the rights that she would have had under the Testators <span class="highlight">Family</span> Maintenance Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is probably the largest court in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parties are entitled as of right to take whatever aspect of their <span class="highlight">family</span> law matter that they wish to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want their <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs broadcast through the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, subject to the one qualification that I have mentioned in supporting an additional term of reference, I strongly support clause ( 1 ) relating to the appointment of a select committee to examine the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has been in operation for more than 2 years, having commenced on 5 January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They involved new legal structures in the creation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They involved the creation of a specialist court, in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, to administer the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They established such a body as the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council which is a specialist body working in the fields associated with various aspects of the Act and its administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Court decisions in cases like Russell v. Russell and Farrelly v. Farrelly have created new problems in the area of property and maintenance that members of this Parliament, at the time of supporting the implementation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act could not have foreseen or interpreted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most recent report of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council indicates a summary of recommendations which are already with the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)-  and I commend the work that has been done by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be fair enough, in terms of an exercise in political polemic, to ask: What are the effects on the nature of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Posed in those simplistic terms- with all respect to those who have drafted the foreshadowed amendment- I do not know how one with the wisdom of Solomon could make a finding on that matter in view of the pressures on <span class="highlight">family</span> life in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view divorce primarily is a symptom of the disease of marriage breakdown which itself is also a symptom of other pressures on the whole institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> which exist in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the problem that I see in attaching this type of proposed amendment- no matter how worthy the motives might be- to the motion to establish a parliamentary committee that is to deal with what I see as fairly technical problems associated with how we can make the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which was passed by this Parliament, work more effectively for the benefit of our people and solve many of the imposing legal problems which have been produced in the last 2 te years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Parliament to Part II of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council’s first annual report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contains some pages covering questions on dissolution and nullity; custody and maintenance of children; third parties and custody; interstate enforcements of custody proceedings; overseas enforcements; the magistrates’ jurisdiction in custody matters; affidavits by children regulations; questions of maintenance and property; powers over property on breakdown of marriage; recission orders; section 79A of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975; magistrates’ approval of agreements under section 87 of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act; and the vexed question of whether courts and their procedures ought to be open or closed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ask this proposed committee also to engage in some sort of analysis of the effects of the Act on the nature of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> I think would be to refer an area of inquiry which ought not to be properly the purview or responsiblity of the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  who is sponsoring the foreshadowed amendments, were to propose the establishment of a parliamentary committee to look at the whole question of the nature of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australian society and the pressures upon it, I would support him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not surprising that in the first year of operation of the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act there was a remarkable and dramatic increase in the number of divorce applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable gentleman that we are living in a society in which the rate of change and the nature of our economic system have put the <span class="highlight">family</span> under tremendous and inordinate pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many pressures which contribute to the cause of <span class="highlight">family</span> break-ups but to attach the responsibility of ascertaining the cause of <span class="highlight">family</span> break-ups to a parliamentary committee that has the responsibility of trying to make more effective what has been an important piece of social legislation, of ironing out the very specific references that have already been referred to the Attorney-General and of producing a piece of legislation which will be relevant to a plural democratic community so that the problems of divorce, maintenance and custody can be resolved in a way which is sensible and rational is to confuse the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that to add to that the interesting question of the effects on the nature of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span> and to isolate the operations of this Act in terms of that very important question is to confuse the very important question of marriage breakdown with the question of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lilley, who is sponsoring this proposed amendment, is concerned, and quite properly so, with the problems that bedevil and upset the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> right across the board at the present time and he wants an inquiry to be conducted into marriage breakdowns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the provisions, and the operation, of the  <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act  1  975,  with particular regard to : <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause (a), after paragraph (i) insert the following paragraph: (ia) its effects on the nature of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>; ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the proposed joint committee to investigate the provisions and the operations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 with particular regard to the ground of divorce and whether there should be other grounds and its effect on the nature of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been fascinated by the argument that the inquiry should be limited and that it should not look in any way at the fact that this law is concerned with the <span class="highlight">family</span> or marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act seeks to define the principles according to which the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is going to make its determinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable member is saying is that we ought to have an investigation into the Act called the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act but we ought not to look at what the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act says about the institution of either the <span class="highlight">family</span> or marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I seek the leave of the House to alter my amendment so that the amendment would then read:  (ia) its effects on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 43 (b) refers to the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of reference are, like the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act itself, excessively legalistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Paragraphs (iii) to (vh) of clause 1 (a) deal respectively with the technical features of the inquiry, the organisation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court, the conduct of proceedings by the various courts, whether the proceedings in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should be more open to the public, the services provided by counsellors and the cost of proceedings under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that the <span class="highlight">family</span> in society is changing, and it is changing at a very rapid rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is changing because society itself is altering its attitude towards the <span class="highlight">family</span> and marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to look at the operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and to see what relation that Act has to the changes that ostensibly and clearly are occurring in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Commitments in respect of the <span class="highlight">family</span> have altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see that as being an emphasis in the thinking of the Government and in the manner in which it provides for the implementation and operation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most distressing thing I have experienced in my electorate is the long delays that people have to suffer under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that prior to the passage of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, and when it first came into operation, there were continual outcries at the high rate of divorce, but I think most people now realise that those very high rates experienced in the early years of the Act’s implementation really represented a clearing away of the backlog of marriage breakdowns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The proposed select committee to inquire into and report upon the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act will serve a very useful purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is for the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life as the cornerstone of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our examination of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act we should have this basic concept in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any examination of the operation of the Act should view as a matter of utmost importance the need for the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too many people seem to be hell bent on providing every possible avenue, indeed almost every encouragement, towards the breaking up of <span class="highlight">family</span> life, with its consequent often tragic disadvantages to the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, the humanitarian aspect of the breaking up of marriage, and the effect on any resulting <span class="highlight">family</span>, is in my opinion the very first aspect of the operations of the Act that should be carefully examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that aspect that I emphasise tonight in this debate about an examination of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My contention, upon which I base my remarks, is that the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life is important and has a beneficial effect on society as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life which gives me most concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people, including myself, believe that the preservation of <span class="highlight">family</span> life is a very important factor in maintaining a stable society- a society which will give the maximum number of children the advantages that only a normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge quite freely that success in life has been achieved by many people who have suffered disadvantages in many ways, including the disadvantage of not having the benefit of a normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, particular attention should be paid to the preservation of marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life to the maximum extent possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that <span class="highlight">family</span> life and marriage come under increasing pressures in what we call the modern way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life as one of the very important aspects of community life in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will examine the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act with the sincerity of purpose which I believe has activated most honourable members who have taken part in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is a genuine desire to try to improve the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe very strongly that unless we preserve the security of <span class="highlight">family</span> life we will be stepping down from the standards which the pioneers of this country and other people have provided in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They adopted a better approach to the necessity to accept some of the problems with which marriage and <span class="highlight">family</span> life are confronted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the essence of my remarks tonight is that we should examine this matter carefully and determine whether there is anything that this Parliament can do by way of amending the legislation to enable people to preserve marriages, both in their own interests and in the interests of any <span class="highlight">family</span> which might have resulted from those marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has been operating now for  2Vi  years and I think that most honourable members in the House would agree that many aspects of it have been more than welcome and have worked very well indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go along particularly with the first amendment he moved to clause (1) of the motion which seeks to add the following words as paragraph (ia): its effects on the institution of marriage and the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go back to the days when the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was being debated in this House and in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we must be able to see some connection there between some of the aspects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and the situation that is developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rather agree with the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett),  who claimed that the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit is the basis of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit has been that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are aspects of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that can contribute to the stabilisation of marriage or that are detracting from it already they should be investigated by this committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bitterness that is occurring was hopefully to be eliminated with the institution of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any way that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act can assist marriage it should be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easier in some ways to deal with those changes, before I come to how they affect the <span class="highlight">family</span>, by referring to the editorial in the  Australian Financial Review  of 22 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the proposition to tax <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances concerning many children who are worse off than many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BUDGET AN INTOLERABLE BURDEN ON THE <span class="highlight">FAMILY</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, The Liberal Party has always professed to be a party that recognised the value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday, August 15, the Fraser Liberal Government showed in its actions, if not its words, that it no longer recognised the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as an important social or economic unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its attempts to balance the nation’s budget, the Government robbed the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of the maternity allowance, the decision to tax <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for students receiving scholarships, the increases in taxes and in petrol, the cuts in the national school dental scheme, the failure to increase and index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will hit <span class="highlight">family</span> budgets very hard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, while it has robbed the <span class="highlight">family</span> budget and increased financial pressures on families, the savings the Government will make from its changes in this area are meagre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of the maternity allowance saves only $7.2 m (on 1977-78 figures), the cuts in the school dental scheme save S4.9m and the administrative costs of taxing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will be high in relation to the amount to be saved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And while it has made these changes which adversely affect the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Government will still continue to pay a maternity allowance to the Canberra bureaucrats which is worth $2,400 to a woman on $200 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3m for institutionalised child care and $1 1.5m for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> (Divorce) Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that not only is the Government financially pressuring the <span class="highlight">family</span>, but that it is also going out of its way to encourage mothers to leave their children and enter the paid workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is clearly a direct attack on families and on <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have an adverse effect on <span class="highlight">family</span> budgets, on young people seeking jobs and on <span class="highlight">family</span> life by forcing both parents into the paid workforce and thus splitting families even more than they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History may well record this Budget as being the most anti-<span class="highlight">family</span> Budget ever brought down by any Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had the Government had a different set of priorities and wanted to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, then it would have at least maintained the maternity allowance at its 1977-78 level, decided that under no circumstances would it have taxed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and certainly it would have increased and indexed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Budget is clearly a direct attack on families and on <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had the Government had a different set of priorities and wanted to help the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, then it would have at least maintained the maternity allowance at its 1 977-78 level, decided that under no circumstances would it have taxed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and certainly it would have increased and indexed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows the loss to the <span class="highlight">family</span> taxpayer because of the failure of this Government to index the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the table I have compared the cumulative tax rebate which has been lost since the Government abolished the tax rebate which was introduced in the 1975-76 Hayden Budget and the rather small child endowment that was paid under Labor with the amount the taxpayer’s <span class="highlight">family</span> now obtains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me give the example of the <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the 50c child endowment, that <span class="highlight">family</span> would have been receiving $5.66 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">family</span> has lot $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just hope that these people will look at the figures and will understand that the Government has failed to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, during the last few weeks before the Budget came down, floated alleged proposals- I am afraid that some of our people picked these up- that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for the first child were to be abolished or were to be taxed as part of the mother’s income, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people were relieved to find that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances continued at the previous level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I supported the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances replacing the tax rebate back in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But through changing a tax rebate which was indexed to a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which was not, greater and greater amounts of money are being lost by people with families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it was wrong that old people and people with pressing <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, should have to be greatly concerned about their future economic activity because some newspaper reporter for cheap notoriety and political gain seeks to print in a newspaper a figment of his or her imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is living up to the promise it gave in the election campaign to provide universal health care cover, but we are leaving it to the individual to decide what type of coverage he wants for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the rhetoric of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  about sharing burdens equally, the Budget deliberately sets out to force low income earners, the aged, <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinners and the unemployed to pick up the tab for the Government’s obsession with lowering inflation by reducing government expenditure and the money supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This Government has responded to the needs of Australia by getting the underlying factors of the economy right, reducing inflation and interest rates and introducing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the greatest social reform in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The right honourable gentleman, in making his speech last evening, said that I had endeavoured to hide the facts as to my <span class="highlight">family</span> assets and that I had told a lie in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So,  Mr Speaker,  the position is that I have not hidden anything, I have not lied on any occasion and none of my <span class="highlight">family</span> has avoided or evaded tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the election campaign the  National Times  asked the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Lionel  Bowen, and many other people the following questions: ‘Do you have <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only wish to say that, as I understood  Mr Oakes  ‘s article,  Mr Oakes,  having seen the income tax return, indicated that it demonstrated that there was something called the ‘Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust is not a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust so be it, but there seem to be certain inconsistencies in the honourable gentleman’s statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing about which I want to make a point is this: I make no criticism of the honourable gentleman for having a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman seems to misunderstand my point of criticism of him; not for having a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust because many people have a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only point of criticism that I make of the honourable gentleman is that in the original  National Times  article he said that he did not have a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, but all of the subsequent evidence would seem to be that he has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his children have a trustee as opposed to a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust company, that makes no difference in law and in the benefits available under the various Acts relating to trustees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made accusations against the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  which finally he had to retract because the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, whilst he has trusts for his children, does not have <span class="highlight">family</span> trust companies for income splitting or tax avoidance purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will illustrate as my colleagues who have spoken in this debate have already done, how the burdens fall on pensioners and families, particularly families with young children who are the recipients of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which was substituted a couple of years ago for tax rebates based on the number of children in a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other day I dealt at length with a particular avoidance scheme, that is, the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust There can, of course, be genuine <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts set up for the purpose of protecting the interests of a <span class="highlight">family</span> as a result of a death in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, whereby the assets of the parent who died are willed to the children or the grandchildren. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, by dividing the income from a property of, say, $60,000, which normally would attract tax at the rate of approximately 60c in the dollar, amongst four members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the income is reduced to $ 1 5,000 for each of those members, which would attract a tax of 15c in the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accepting that there are genuine <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, does the right honourable gentleman agree that the Government is losing massive revenue as a result of the widespread use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and interlocking companies as an income-splitting technique for tax avoidance purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-There are many people throughout this community, and I suspect that there are many in this Parliament, quite apart from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and others who have indicated that they have <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts of one form or another, who believe that a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust is necessary for the best discharge of their own <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, and the Government will not move away from that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that an income earner with income from sources other than wages and salaries of $33,000 a year- for instance, a wealthy land holder from the Western districts of Victoria- supporting a wife and two children, one under 16 years and one over 16 years, can set up a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust exclusively for tax avoidance measures and the tax savings through those avoidance measures would be $4,950 a year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps does the Prime Minister propose to take to close off this tax avoidance which is depriving the Government of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue so that he can avoid in future Budgets taxing sources of income of the more deprived groups such as those dependent on low income, on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances or on various allowances for the handicapped? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what the honourble gentleman is seeking to do at the moment is to establish the circumstances in which a person with a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust should feel obliged to do what the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last election I never hid the fact that I had a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made it perfectly plain also that the purposes of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts have generally been to hold a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s assets together, especially in industries that have been low in profitability, as rural industries and other small industries have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know of any trust which has been established to look after the <span class="highlight">family</span> interests which does not also have that result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have sent notice to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  that I will be asking him to carry out his undertaking of 20 September to disclose the tax return of the Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it clear that, of course, <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts ordinarily are quite proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if one looks at  Hansard  one will see that on that night I said: Where is the tax return of the Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the tax return of the Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can readily see that the only way to settle that point is for the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to do as he said he would and as the Prime Minister invited him to do and disclose the tax return of the Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of the matter is this: Only by doing what the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said he would do, namely disclosing the Bowen <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, can two issues be settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I want to know is this: In accordance with the statement of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition on 20 September 1978 that he would disclose the tax return of the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that he would disclose the tax return at the time the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust situation was raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since business assets and property held in the name of the husband will be able to pass within the <span class="highlight">family</span> free of federal estate duty, could the Prime Minister explain to this House what other benefit, apart from the minimisation or avoidance of income tax, is provided by a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the fact that the latest taxation statistics show that there are 131,000 trusts mean that there are more than 15 members on average in each <span class="highlight">family</span> taking advantage of trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Opposition is trying to do now, in response to the numerous steps that this Government has taken and will continue to take over the next two years in respect of tax avoidance, is to raise the issue of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In continuing its review of mistakes made in the 1978-79 Budget, will the Government now reverse its decision to index pensions once a year instead of twice a year- a proposal which will deny pensioners increases worth $ 100m- and will it abandon the proposal to increase the tax paid on accumulated annual leave and long service leave while the Government allows capital gains in excess of $200,000 to go undisturbed and tax avoidance <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts immunity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was it an equity proposition that this Budget brought down no capital gains tax, no tax on excess profits and no action against <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and gave an extra $340m to oil companies while trying to tax kids and the handicapped? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to make provisions regarding children uniform the Government has also decided that the upper age limit of 25 years for payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and double orphan’s pension will also apply to payment of additional pension and additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will continue the new scheme of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances which it introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social Services Act provides that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, including double orphan’s pension and handicapped child’s allowance shall be payable in respect of endowment periods as determined by the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill amends the Social Services Act to provide that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance be paid in respect of monthly endowment periods rather than the existing four-weekly periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances will accordingly be expressed in monthly amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  the following table showing the present weekly rates and proposed monthly rates of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives effect to the Government’s decision that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance will no longer be paid for students receiving Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances or other related Commonwealth education allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to compensate for the loss of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, the rates of TEAS and other related Commonwealth education allowances are being increased by $5.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Act stands at present the Department of Social Security has been advised that it is possible for two people to be paid a full <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for the same child at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provisions in the Social Services Act currently enable <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, including handicapped child’s allowance and double orphan’s pension, and additional pension or supporting parent’s benefit or additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children to be paid for a child living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rates of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the size of the tax rebates for dependants are set in the light of Australian conditions and, in many cases, would be over-generous having regard to the cost of maintaining a dependant overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absence of such a limit is inconsistent with the upper age limit of 25 years applied in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance under the Social Services Act and with the 25 years age limit included in the income tax legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While providing fund benefit coverage for all items in the Schedule exclusion from fund benefit of a specified sum of fund benefit entitlements- up to $500 a year (<span class="highlight">family</span>) $250 a year (single). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registered organisations should frame their rules so that in assessing when the exclusion has been met by the contributor it should regard a <span class="highlight">family</span> as one unit and total the days or number of services or cost of services or days used by the whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In framing rules for hospital benefit tables which include options, organisations would provide the same level of benefit exclusion for both <span class="highlight">family</span> and single contributors under that particular table- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point I would like to deal with is the question of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which we have been talking about during the last few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was criticism of the attempt to means test the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the Government’s original proposition which aimed to exclude from receipt of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance those families in respect of whom a trust had been set up to reduce taxation and therefore benefit the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My criticism of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme at present in existence in Australia is that the allowance has not been indexed as the taxation deductions it replaced about three years ago were indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore every <span class="highlight">family</span> containing taxpayers is losing by the transfer to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The table shows clearly that, because of the Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child, provided there is a taxpayer in the <span class="highlight">family</span>, loses $2.16 a week; a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children loses $3.32 a week; a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children loses $4.48 a week and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a significant loss and I hope that the Government will be forced by public opinion and by the Opposition to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, when people cannot get jobs there are social implications which flow right back through into the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, and thus many people are affected adversely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is in relation to the dropping of the imposition of the means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and of the income taxing of invalid and Service pensions and rehabilitation and sheltered employment allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we had the reversal of the decision to means test <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to means test <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances was in direct contradiction of the assurance given by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another decision affecting disadvantaged people is the failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances has fallen 27 per cent since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> planning services, in real terms, are to be cut back, as are the community health programs which are so important to women as they support women’s health centres and refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the expenditure of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I glance through this great catalogue of cuts and curtailments in government benefits, I see, for example, that the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances abroad is to be discontinued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 indicates the Government’s decision no longer to pay outside Australia <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, orphans’ pensions and handicapped children’s allowances unless the child is temporarily abroad, living abroad pending migration to Australia and living abroad with a person receiving the Australian pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen that the degree of inequality of incomes is diminished by the same extent as income tax when imputed rent from owner-occupied houses are added to original <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not concerned about those who form <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts to evade taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I draw to the attention of the Committee a concern that I have expressed in recent times about the need for governments in this country to have a <span class="highlight">family</span> policy- a policy that is designed to enable the families of the nation to achieve the objectives that they would like to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should develop a <span class="highlight">family</span> policy so that at least in an explicit way government actions strengthen the role that the community wants the <span class="highlight">family</span> to perform rather than, by design or inadvertence, weaken its capacity to fulfil the role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as an adjunct to the development of a policy for the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> we should institute the preparation of impact statements by government departments so that when they make policy decisions they are required to indicate the way in which they believe those decisions would affect families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All too often we look at the effect of policies and programs on the community at large and on the individual but we often forget that they have an effect upon that small group with whom the great majority of Australians relate most; that is, their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not seeking in this debate tonight to define the very wide range of differing <span class="highlight">family</span> configurations that might exist within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well have to look into that question to ensure that work opportunities are adequately and equitably shared among Australian families- to ensure that each <span class="highlight">family</span> has a fair opportunity to develop for itself and for its children the opportunities that we would all like them to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great innovations of the Government was the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had been a <span class="highlight">family</span> impact statement we may not have been faced with a debate about the effect of certain proposals, which have now been withdrawn, in relation to the so-called ‘newsboy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should be continued on a universal basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not, we place a <span class="highlight">family</span> with dependent children in a disadvantaged position in comparison with a <span class="highlight">family</span> that has the same income but no dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the economy revives the purchasing power of these <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should be examined so that they can be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In time we will need to give consideration to increasing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance paid in respect of the first child and in respect of children under the age of six. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We pay the lowest rates of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of the first child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not just receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the patterns outlined above do seem to support the case for transfer payments to serve the needs of households during the vital years of <span class="highlight">family</span> formation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who in this House represents the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the need for the Government to look at the total <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance program and the need as circumstances permit to ask the question whether when we increase those benefits to maintain their real value we should not at the same time make a substantial increase in real value of the payments made in respect of the first child particularly while that first child is in the pre-school age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> is eligible for a number of separate payments, each of which tapers away as private income increases, the total reduction in the various benefits can often rise till it nearly wipes out the increase in private income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In passing, I refer to the dropping of the iniquitous means testing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard to accept that the original intention was simply to prevent tax avoidance by some people by the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts into which children’s unearned income is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also give an assurance to the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  that I will convey to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in due course the views and the suggestions that he has made in regard to the way in which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should be dealt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is promoting the integrated, loving and caring <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as the soundest place in which to bring up children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She advocates that children should at all times be protected by the <span class="highlight">family</span>, by society and by law from exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that I speak for all honourable members in this House -I hope so anyway- when I say that it is agreed that a decent <span class="highlight">family</span> life and legal protection from salacious exploitation are the very least we owe our Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the decent ALP members in this House can be ashamed of the student club either for its unintelligent foolishness in thoughtlessly condemning something on which it did not bother to get some hard facts; or worse, for its implicit support for the disgusting exploitation that  Mrs Whitehouse  opposes and its implicit denial of the value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the basic unit of society and the best haven for the growing child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Whitehouse seeks to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>before suggesting that the <span class="highlight">family</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given inflation, the product of inflated land values and the extent of capitalisation in agriculture, this investment is one which most <span class="highlight">family</span> farmers find more and more difficult to encompass under normal lending circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bank, the <span class="highlight">family</span> farmer will be able to look to the future with considerably more confidence than would otherwise have been possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reduction in medical insurance rates of $2.80 a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span> was announced yesterday by the first major NSW health fund to have new tables approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major reasons is that it will not close off one of the most important means of tax evasion in this country, that is, <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very obvious that the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust mechanism is being used as a means of avoiding taxation and that this is costing this country many hundreds of millions if not thousands of millions of dollars in revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done so because it is losing such massive amounts in revenue from the use of the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust mechanism as a means of avoiding taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us look at when the proliferation of the use of trusts and <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a practicing accountant at that time, I can certify that these <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts found their basic origin and their growth in the years when the ordinary individual was being overtaxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> trust or the trust structure is no different from a private company or a public company structure in which the income is spread over a greater area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the fact that we have not recognised certain alterations which should be made in the companies structure has led to <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts being created so that these tax concessions can be gained in practically the same way they are gained in companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have legislation which provides for one basic tax rate on income, whether on the basis of capital gains or otherwise, with a ceiling to ensure that a <span class="highlight">family</span> or an individual is allowed to earn a certain income free of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing firstly with the unfairness of the proposals, they penalise wage and salary earners, and in a severe way in many cases, but they allow privileged opportunities like capital gains, excess profits generated by mineral development companies in this country, windfall gains as additions to the profits of oil companies derived because of arrangements instituted by this Government, and <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts to go scot free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, that is the whole tactic behind the thrust of Government fiscal thinking at present, a shift of the burden of fiscal responsibility away from the wealthy, away from the high income earners like the Prime Minister who in any case pays very little tax because of the tax avoidance devices he has been able to establish like his <span class="highlight">family</span> trust- and on to the shoulders of the middle and modest income earners and especially on to the low income earners in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I would like to see the Government moving towards is a resource tax raising $ 150m; to eliminate the crude oil levy windfall gain to the oil development companies of $340m; to impose a capital gains tax on gains in excess of $200,000, raising $300m; to adjust the highest levels of personal income tax to raise $200m; to abolish the investment allowance, $400m; to abolish tax avoidance through <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, $100m-$l,490,000 as against the imposition of the direct increases in personal tax and denying pensioners and employment beneficiaries and other social welfare beneficiaries of benefits amounting to about $l,140m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that way, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances could have been adjusted in some respect at least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned, by not indexing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, which replaced indexed taxation deductions, the Government is reducing the value of those <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children there is a loss of $4.48, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with four children a loss of $5.89, for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children a loss of $6.55, and for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with six children a loss of $7.46 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That represents a net loss to every taxpaying <span class="highlight">family</span> in this country and is in addition to the extra taxation which is being levied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the Government doing about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in this Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not indexing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; it is abolishing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for those children in receipt of allowances under prescribed educational schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents of those students will lose the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is taking away the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance from the parents of students who are entitled to an allowance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, and we all know that a severe means test is applied under that Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Government is taking away the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance from those parents whose children qualify to receive a benefit under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and other schemes, yet it is not removing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance from those people who earn much more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a parent earns a very large amount of money, earns too much for his student child to receive the TEAS allowance, and is able to send his child to university or to some other tertiary institution, there is no attempt to remove the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payable to those parents who qualify under the means test will actually be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I advance the thought to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  and the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay)  who are at the table, that when considering forward planning for good, decent living for all Australian people, they bear in mind that under the arrangements for the payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and tertiary assistance there is some discrimination against big families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We find under the existing arrangements that no <span class="highlight">family</span> can receive at one and the same time a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and a Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, that the one child <span class="highlight">family</span> is better off by $1.75 a week, that the two-child <span class="highlight">family</span> is better off by 25c a week and that the five-child <span class="highlight">family</span> is worse off by $ 1.75 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Students in the last two years of secondary school can still get the <span class="highlight">family</span> and student allowances and I hope that those people who are facing traumas because of incorrect information on the subject sent out by Opposition members from time to time can take heart from the fact that families can still receive the student allowance in respect of secondary school children as well as the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I offer the suggestion that for future planning we should consider the indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we want to encourage Australian families and encourage mothers to stay at home we must index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly I hope that he would, having read the publicity, think twice about the threats he has offered with respect to his own life and think whether perhaps he would not be better to give himself up for the sake of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and prevent the furtherance of an incident such as that which affected the poor Miss Phillips. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we take that in conjunction with the continuing reduction in the amount of money available to a <span class="highlight">family</span> under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme as a result of the nonindexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, there is a significant loss of spending money for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 23 seeks to abolish the payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for those students who are covered by certain prescribed education schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, these families will be unable to receive benefits in respect of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These families which do not qualify under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, for example, will still receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of means testing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was raised in another context in the Budget, and we all know that the Government changed its mind on the question of the abolition of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance as far as the income of children is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that there are other sections of the community in respect of which the Government would be quite reasonably justified in abolishing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the case in which the child is being used as part of a tax avoidance scheme and has significant income via a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust or some  othersimilarmethod.Itisverydifficulttojustify  the payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to such families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly hope the Government will continue to look for some fairer method of means testing the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again emphasise the fact that we are dealing with the abolition of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in the case of those families which have already passed a means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there will be no abolition of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in the case of other families whose children are attending tertiary institutions up to the age of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I want to say in fairness to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  who is at the table and who has shown himself to be remarkably sensitive and responsive to the needs of the community, that I believe he more than perhaps any other Minister would watch closely the impact of the alteration with respect to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme on young persons who are qualifying for assistance under education schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Government could have considered increasing the size of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance to a decent amount to aid lower income families during a pregnancy and after the birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that a government, many of whose Ministers are very experienced in the operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts they know how they work all sat down and decided that what they were concerned to do was to - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to illustrate the point I am pointing out that many of the Ministers of this Government were very fully informed as to the operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that what they were really out to attack was the operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and funds in the hands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As from 1 January 1 979, there will be no dual payment of TEAS allowance and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to compensate for the loss of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance the rates of TEAS allowance for 1979 have been increased by the equivalent of $5.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in order to prevent the need to recover any <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which may have been paid to the student’s mother over that period, the arrears of TEAS allowance will be paid at the 1978 rates with the increased rates for 1979 applying from March onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Education will liaise closely with the Department of Social Security in order to prevent the situation arising in which an overpayment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase of $5.25 a week in the rates of TEAS allowance for 1 979 will correspond to the average amount of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-We of the Opposition oppose clause 25 because it denies payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of a dependant receiving a benefit under the tertiary education assistance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving an income of $8,600 a year- that is the threshold of the means test operative in relation to TEAS payments- and having a dependent child receiving a TEAS payment will lose its <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the dependent children of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $40,000 a year will not be eligible to receive TEAS payments but will still be eligible for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The dependent children of a <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving an income of $40,000 or more a year will be eligible to receive a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance but not eligible for a TEAS allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dependent children of a <span class="highlight">family</span> on an income of” $8,600 or less a year will be eligible to receive a TEAS allowance but will not be eligible to receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the children in the lower income <span class="highlight">family</span> should still be eligible to receive the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How pious the Prime Minister sounds when he pontificates about the need to hold the <span class="highlight">family</span> farm together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do say that we have to ensure that the young people, the <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinners and the people who have worked for many years but who. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that quite often extra expenses are involved for a <span class="highlight">family</span> when someone from the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a patient in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no loss of income but there is a loss so far as the <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise also that a saving is involved for the <span class="highlight">family</span> because the husband does not have to be fed during the time he is hospitalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a method of not only averaging our costs over the community at a given time, but also averaging costs for each <span class="highlight">family</span> over a lifetime rather than paying most at a time when it has least resources to call upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is that unless those persons have members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> who are chronically ill or who are likely to require surgery under private conditions, they should certainly not take out medical cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In passing, I make the comment that this particular piece of legislation will increase the cost of that cover by 75c or 80c a week for a <span class="highlight">family</span> because of the removal of the subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us assume that things are bad as far as one <span class="highlight">family</span> is concerned and a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> has major surgery requiring an anaesthetist, an assistant, a couple of tests, all involving an expenditure of $100 or $120. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if this sort of attitude becomes prevalent I would think that a number of people, particularly <span class="highlight">family</span> groups who would not have the financial resources to withstand some of the bouts of illness or accidents that occur from time to time, could be enticed not to insure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The abolition of the levy of 2.5 per cent will mean a minimum saving of some $150 for a single person or $300 for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view expressed by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  yesterday really related to the fact that in his moments of relaxation the Prime Minister might watch those television shows which deal with the old <span class="highlight">family</span> doctor operating in a small rural hamlet or in a country town where he is intimately associated with not merely the medical condition of all the people who live there but also their social and economic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me to be absurd to say that if a medical practitioner arrives at a house at 10 o’clock at night he must make some sort of a judgment about whether the <span class="highlight">family</span> is socially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For almost three years, this Government has been lying to the people about its economic policies, unemployment, interest rates, the illusion of tax cuts, pensions and the professed concern of the Prime Minister for the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, let me quote the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $10,000 a year and an average size loan of $21,800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> would be paying $5.64 a week extra as a result of the loss of the benefit of the housing interest mortgage subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Relief from death duties and gift duties in my State of Queensland has helped to keep <span class="highlight">family</span> enterprises together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is mounting anger and frustration among the thousands of small <span class="highlight">family</span> grapegrowers of the South Australian Riverland as they face another year of poverty and hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a doctor refuses to do this generally or refuses to do it in the case of a particular person or a particular <span class="highlight">family</span>, the 40 per cent or $20 gap Commonwealth benefit arrangement applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he returned he found that all of the <span class="highlight">family</span> property in that country had been destroyed by the Nazis and his father had been shot by the Gestapo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although these payments which are taxed are coming from the Dutch Government as compensation for what he and his <span class="highlight">family</span> suffered during the war, people who receive compensation payments from the West German Government as victims of Nazi atrocities apparently have those payments exempted from income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that women, in whom the Government has made a considerable investment in terms of training and development of expertise, are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment while also raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, individual schools would not discriminate among their pupils on the basis of the size of the parents’ income and would receive from the government the same basic sum whether a pupil was from a wealthy <span class="highlight">family</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This system would draw education funding away from a concentration on the needs of schools to a concern for the needs of the individual <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is only fair that if an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> can afford to send its children to boarding school it should receive no more aid than the equivalent non-Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> living in the same area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Historically and linguistically it is an extremely important language- it is a Semitic language, as honourable members would know- but very rarely taught although there are thousands of children in Lalor ‘s schools whose <span class="highlight">family</span> tongue is Maltese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He ignores the fact that in most cases- certainly it is the case in my electorate- if married women are working they are doing so to sustain the income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> and not to keep kids out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they were to move away from their present employment the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> would go down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Retirement at age 55 works well in Japan, where it is the norm, because the Japanese <span class="highlight">family</span> is essentially three generational. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not the pattern of <span class="highlight">family</span> life in Australia where work is an essential prop for most people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This leads us to the concept of the guaranteed minimum income, that is, that each <span class="highlight">family</span> ought to have a minimum income based on its reasonable needs, irrespective of how many members work, so as to keep up current levels of consumption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then goes on to say that if one does not come from a good <span class="highlight">family</span> background one is at a disadvantage in becoming a lawyer, because one has not learnt the traditions of learning and scholarship which, to a considerable degree, are transmitted by the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members, I table two papers: One titled ‘Means and Needs Test and Contributions Guidelines’ and the other titled ‘Solicitors’ fees in Matters under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for legal aid is not as urgent in dissolution cases as in many other <span class="highlight">family</span> law proceedings, such as custody, access, maintenance, property settlement and injunction matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure to dissolve a marriage is now very simple and it is believed that most people will be able to handle the work themselves, with assistance where necessary from the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A court fee of $ 100 is payable to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in respect of proceedings for dissolution of marriage, but where the applicant has been granted legal aid for those proceedings the applicant is exempt from payment of the fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Regulations at present provide for the fee to be not payable where the Registrar of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court is satisfied that payment of the fee would impose substantial hardship on the applicant, and that provision will remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solicitors who act for clients who are in receipt of legal aid from the Australian Legal Aid Office are paid 90 per cent of the fees payable under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law (Costs) Regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court and other superior courts much of the work can properly be handled by solicitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again the Government has talked about legal aid being concerned with the real problems in <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the report stated, so far as road transport is concerned, the <span class="highlight">family</span> car will be the main mode of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not suggesting that it is a <span class="highlight">family</span> arrangement, but a  Mrs Katter  seems to be connected with the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been conceded again by the AttorneyGeneral’s Department that over 80 per cent of funds allocated for legal aid are expended in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what is going to occur in the area of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What an extraordinary thing it is for the Government to be changing the guidelines in respect of the operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> law when only a few weeks ago we established an all-party parliamentary committee to look at the operation of <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the rights of people to legal aid under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are a major factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of illustration- there are plenty of them- the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts are particularly disadvantaged, with two judges sitting, reportedly doing the work of five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  <span class="highlight">family</span> has grown up in the meantime and he is still waiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the  Bulletin  of 24 October and in the Australian Broadcasting Commission program  AM  of 18 October it was asserted that I had been asked to show cause why I should not be prosecuted under the Companies Act for offences arising from the affairs of private <span class="highlight">family</span> companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a question in this House on 25 October, as reported at page 2260 of  Hansard,  the Leader of the Opposition referred to ‘sums of at least $164,000 gained by the Minister or by his <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The withdrawals were entirely within the credit due to my <span class="highlight">family</span> interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure him that at successive meetings at which all shareholders, including representatives of the Walsh <span class="highlight">family</span>, were present, the appointment of  Mr Torok  was agreed on by resolution of all the shareholders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-To the best of my knowledge, all members of the Walsh <span class="highlight">family</span> have agreed with the resolutions which were supported on their behalf by those who attended the meetings of the companies to which I referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite all the changes to the health insurance system, despite universality, despite the fact that they could have obtained universal cover for a <span class="highlight">family</span> for a maximum of $300 a year, the majority of the people covered themselves for more expensive health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: Is this  Mr Haylen  whom his staff could not identify the same  Mr Haylen  who is a chartered accountant appointed by the Minister to represent his <span class="highlight">family</span> interests in the examination of the business affairs of the Sinclair Pastoral Co.? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At each of those meetings a resolution was passed, with the complete support of the representatives of the Walsh <span class="highlight">family</span> group, appointing  Mr Torok  as representative in all matters pertaining to the inquiry before  Mr Finnane,  that is the Corporate Affairs Commission inquiry instigated by the New South Wales Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>possibility of a <span class="highlight">family</span> policy being introduced in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, any government which ignored its responsibility regarding the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit as being the basis of a healthy society would be doing this country a great disservice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If families happen to be better off at the moment as a result of the amalgam of policies put forward from time to time from the variety of portfolios which affect <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances, I say that it is due more to good luck than to good management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many portfolios have an indirect effect on <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if we confine ourselves to those departments which have a direct effect on <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances, both financially and legally, one can see that there are several departments which should share a coordinated approach to <span class="highlight">family</span> preservation policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are just eight departments which, through Government policies, have a direct effect on <span class="highlight">family</span> circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can ask: Do they act in a coordinated way with respect to support for the preservation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I suggested earlier, if changes to direct taxation levels, changes to the health insurance scheme, changes in pensions or <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, changes in education funding and other measures all combine either to improve or disadvantage the circumstances of individual families, it is more a coincidence than reasoned social policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, therefore, as part of a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy, it is necessary for government policies which directly affect the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit to be subjected to a <span class="highlight">family</span> impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that this Government would be sympathetic to any suggestion aimed at preserving the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments are very long on rhetoric in this regard and many leaders speak very emotionally about the declining state of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in a trendy and permissive world but nothing ever seems to be done about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, it could be argued as part of a population policy for Australia but primarily I would support such policies simply because of my belief in the concept of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental group unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the basis of my contention that Australia should have a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> impact statements, more positive steps could be taken through the income support system or the taxation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere is the neglect of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit better seen than in the area of tax policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the needs of the State and the needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> are not incompatible and both can be reasonably catered for, even in times of economic restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of income support, selectivity in transfer payments can be applied or, through the taxation system, the <span class="highlight">family</span> could receive some recognition rather than just individuals, without prejudicing fiscal policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the moment, there is no question as to where the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one compares the various income alternatives of a man working on average award rates, a woman working on average award rates, and a couple with one income and the benefits of rebates accruing to their <span class="highlight">family</span> of say, two, three or four children, there is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">family</span> group is disadvantaged in relation to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more than this, governments should be able to ensure that the position of the single-income <span class="highlight">family</span> should not progressively deteriorate and should not be discriminated against by default, by lack of government concern, or by lack of compensating fiscal action compared to the two-income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context, I think we should recall that the Henderson inquiry identified the large, single-income <span class="highlight">family</span> as a major poverty group in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the two-income <span class="highlight">family</span> will always be better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that governments could, almost by accident and in the absence of <span class="highlight">family</span> policy, create a positive disincentive for those young families at the margin, where a choice can be made, who wish to opt for the one-income situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the personal tax system is based on the individual rather than the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a tax unit, the position of the single-income <span class="highlight">family</span> becomes very dependent on rebate systems which historically do not cater adequately for rising costs of dependency or for the declining value of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, I fear that that choice is not being given and this constitutes a continuing and growing threat to the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is better than a system of increasing the spouse rebate for those who have the care of children because it creates an element of horizontal equity which does not exist under the present system where some income earners are able to split their incomes and others, with similar <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, cannot split their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly recommend in the context of these remarks that the Government consider the introduction of a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I probably will be branded as being out-of-date, old-fashioned, not trendy enough or permissive enough, but I submit very strongly that it is absolutely critical for the future stability and health of Australian society that governments as last begin to recognise the role of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is thought that this would have a bad effect on the therapeutic, <span class="highlight">family</span> atmosphere maintained for the the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This figure takes no account of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme which provides mothers with significantly higher benefits than the old child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many women find it essential to return to work after having a child because they are <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinners or because the survival of the <span class="highlight">family</span> depends upon two incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that women, in whom the Government has made a considerable investment in terms of training and development of expertise, are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment while also raising a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With modern <span class="highlight">family</span> planning methods it would be simple to join the Public Service, remain there for 12 months and then become pregnant; so the Government is not going to close that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to accept that many married women work because their husband’s wages are too low to support their <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even this argument ignores the genuine and pressing desire of modern women who find self-fulfilment in active careers outside the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of the changes occurring in Swedish <span class="highlight">family</span> policy have been prompted by this trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been commonly agreed that no financial support for families can match the earnings of a <span class="highlight">family</span> where both parents are able to go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the important point is that the issue of joint <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibility in raising children should be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision is in tune with the more miserable of the Budget changes, such as the abortive attempt to impose a tax on paperboys through penalising their mothers and removing their <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rationale for its policy is to encourage persons with <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities to work outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why the Minister for Primary Industry was able to achieve agreement was that the trading banks would handle not only the refinancing of development but also the normal day to day operations of the man on the land and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We wanted to keep the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit on the farm so that, on the death of the senior representative of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, the surviving members would be able to obtain the facilities necessary to provide for probate and similar matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite frankly, they will not give up- quite rightly I believe- conditions that they have won over many years, conditions which accept the fact that weekends are a time for sport, recreation and leisure, a time to spend with one ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span>; that if they are to be forced to work at those times they are entitled to some form of compensation therefor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It also appears clear to me, although I have not expressed the view to any member of your <span class="highlight">family</span> or to  Mr (Ian)  Sinclair at the present time, but it seems perfectly clear to me that with the exception of you, everybody else has got their heads together and have agreed, not to give false evidence so much, as to agree to present a common front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me perfectly obvious that members of your <span class="highlight">family</span> have been persuaded by being given large cheques and by being given this interest, to agree that it would be in the best interest if they all agreed that they somehow knew about all this, and in some way or other had given some vague general authority for him-  (Mr Ian S inclair)-  to do all this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House ought to note that no charges  or  official allegations have been made by the New South Wales Government or the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission against the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  in relation to his position as executor of his father’s estate and as a director of <span class="highlight">family</span> companies connected with that estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition’s approach has been confused and confusing, sometimes even to the extent of not appearing to know which members of a particular <span class="highlight">family</span> he is dealing with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Labor Opposition are not sticking up for the rights of members of the public to go about their ordinary affairs in their motor vehicles, to go about their affairs concerned with their businesses, with their <span class="highlight">family</span> activities or for purposes of their own pleasure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, I would point out that rural industry as such, being a fragmented industry and an industry that is still largely dependent on <span class="highlight">family</span> farms and farmers, does not have the capacity itself to conduct the research that is necessary whereas in so many areas of secondary industry and mining there are large corporations which already have a large research and development input. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another consequence if this motion were accepted would be a situation in which the honourable member for Robertson would say, when he comes across a mother of three or four children in a street: ‘We would like to have given you a little more money in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payment for your children but- and I know that you will understand- we have taken that because I want that money to pay for my political campaign and my party’s campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we all know, income splitting through <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts is a blatant area of tax avoidance, and although this has been pointed out to the Government time and time again in debate, both the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Treasurer have made it clear that they have no intention of moving to close off this substantial tax loophole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Prime Minister questions regarding <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out in this House on a number of occasions that <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts are one of the main tax avoidance schemes operating in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who believe that a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust is necessary for the best discharge of their own <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities, and the Government will not move away from that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not going to be in a position of denigrating any person with any <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, no matter what the circumstances may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, no matter whether it is a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust for tax avoidance purposes, whether it is a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust which in the past has been used by people, including the Prime Minister himself, to avoid death duties the Prime Minister will not have the loophole plugged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite plainly, a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust serves many purposes and it ought to be stated quite plainly that this Government has been very concerned about the breaking up of <span class="highlight">family</span> farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been very concerned about the breaking up of <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses and, in a high tax situation, especially when there was low profitability in many small businesses and on many farms- under those circumstances - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise this- many people introduced <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts to enable their assets to be held together, their farms preserved . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, I have quoted that part of the Prime Minister’s answer as a good example of his straightout, flat refusal to correct the large scale avoidance of tax and death duties in the past by the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and these involved interlocking companies that he himself has such as Fraser Properties Pty Ltd, the Nareen Pastoral Co. and L.J.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admitted at the time of the last election that I have a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, and there is no reason why that should not stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the last election I never hid the fact that I had a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made it perfectly plain also that the purposes of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts have generally been to hold a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s assets together . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know of any trust which has been established to look after the <span class="highlight">family</span> interests which does not also have that result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the complex arrangments which people entered over the years were simply designed to keep <span class="highlight">family</span> farms and businesses together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very obvious, I think, from what I have shown this afternoon that the Government’s actions in legislation on death duties and gift duties and its refusal to close up the loophole in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts have been taken in the interests of individual and senior members of the Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His suggestion was that a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and not the individual should be taxed so that a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which the husband earns a salary and the wife stays at home has the advantage of spreading that income with his wife and getting the benefit of that, as would apply with the nontaxable ceiling that the neighbours would have if the two of them were at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basis for the flat rate is the claims experience from both single and <span class="highlight">family</span> contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-57-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To name but a few the Government has introduced tax indexation, export incentives, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, automatic indexation of pensions, abolition of estate and gift duties, lowering of Division 7 taxation on private companies, a major improvement in the facilities for migrants and improved social welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will make for good staff morale within the department, so that an officer may go about his job knowing that a permanent head who might have a snout on him will not be in a position to deal with him capriciously and perhaps fine him an inordinate amount of money, which could put him into bankruptcy and ruin his whole <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Making an allowance for child endowment and for the tax rebate which Labor introduced in 1975 and which were effective from the beginning of that financial year, in real terms, a <span class="highlight">family</span> is worse off now as against 1975 by between $2.16 a week in the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one dependent child and $7.46 a week in the case of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with six dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 8 February, the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act held public hearings in Canberra, the principal witness appearing before it being the Attorney-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the concurrence of the Committee I wrote to the editors of the  Australian,  the  Sydney Morning Herald  and the  Daily Telegraph  saying that the Committee was concerned to ensure that the public obtain a balanced view of the evidence being taken by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act Committee, and offered its co-operation in ensuring that this was possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of type of complaints to the Federal Attorney-General’s Department about the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are only a shadow of the real extent of public disquiet about this controversial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Unless reporting of proceedings is fair and accurate the efforts of committees such as the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to inform the public and facilitate intelligent debate on <span class="highlight">family</span> law will be frustrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be no delay and it will be important, if we are to have some constructive consideration of what has happened, that the Press and the media really understand the problems of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a rather amusing thing about this Government that when, approximately one hour ago, it came to light that part of the Prime Minister’s own very extremely wealthy <span class="highlight">family</span> has been given a low interest loan of $250,000, the Labor Party is accused of muck-raking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government cannot say to them: ‘Irrespective of how much training you have done, your higher school certificate or tertiary education, you are going to leave your <span class="highlight">family</span>, you are going to leave your home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manner in which this occurs is that a profitable business or <span class="highlight">family</span> income is sold to a unit trust which has been set up to operate the business and receive all income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous partners are then employed by the trust which runs the business and pays the profits to the discretionary <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts of the partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trust then declared dividends out of the profits from providing the services and paid them to its unit holders who were the partners’ families or <span class="highlight">family</span> companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have asked the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  when he is going to close the loopholes in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> truststrusts generally- which are used as a means of tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is already stated that he was not seeking to evade tax through the maintenance of a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust which he admitted; he was only wanting to avoid death duties, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a tax avoidance device, it is a device to enable your <span class="highlight">family</span> to become part owners in your property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made it perfectly plain also that the purposes of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts have generally been to hold a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s assets together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand the position, for many years the courts refused to apply section 260 if a transaction could be explained as relating to ordinary business or <span class="highlight">family</span> dealings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  consider the proposition that an ordinary business or <span class="highlight">family</span> dealing test be written into section 260, and that the question of whether a transaction is an ordinary business or <span class="highlight">family</span> dealing be finally determined by a panel of lay persons, not judges, with the taxpayer able to provide relevant evidence not to be banned by technical rules of evidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been written into <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts for quite a while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the main causes of income splitting and tax evasion is the fact that in the separation of income between husband and wife or between parents and children the ceiling of $3,893 is enjoyed not by just one person in the <span class="highlight">family</span> but by many members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that, if this Government is genuine in wanting to give equity to the spouse who stays at home and looks after the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the house while the lone income earner is out working, that spouse should be given greater recompense; and this could be indexed almost to the tax ceiling arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just keeping to the mathematics of the matter, I would recommend that either there be no second ceiling for a double income <span class="highlight">family</span> or that the spouse rebate be lifted to $ 1 ,899. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what about the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts here in Australia as an income splitting tax avoidance measure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  using such a simple <span class="highlight">family</span> trust as this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be said that certain people, honest men, do take advantage of tax avoidance schemes through <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The owners of small <span class="highlight">family</span> businesses have been working extremely long hours and receiving no return just to keep the doors open. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perfectly plain when one looks at the figures that there has been a particular <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion rate applicable to Greece which is higher than that for many other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that  Mr Kaldis  was complaining about <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that 77 per cent of Greek migrants in the last year were approved on a <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion basis compared to 31.6 per cent for Italian migrants, 15 per cent for South African migrants, 24 per cent for Rhodesian migrants and a higher level of 64 per cent for migrants from Turkey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many Greek persons in the St George electorate and the more Greek migrants who come here under the points system the better- and that includes <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Coming as it does at a time of distress and sadness this approach often results in the grieving <span class="highlight">family</span> honouring the supposed debt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On  Nationwide  tonight we heard about the Beggs scandal involving the Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has not done anything for the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> that it would not do for others similarly placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received no representations from anybody in relation to these loans, and the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>’s presentation of its affairs has been exemplary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government that some special attention be given to the needs of the ethnic groups in Australia because of very close <span class="highlight">family</span> links and emotional ties they have with those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">family</span> is involved the total insurance premium, worked out at the rate of $25 per ticket on a round trip to the United Kingdom, can add up to a substantial amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example that has been given to me is that of a <span class="highlight">family</span>- a husband, wife and two children- travelling to England in the shoulder or high peak season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They do not want their children to receive unemployment benefits- not because of a rationale that the young people are not entitled to them but because they live in fear of the stigma that would be associated with the <span class="highlight">family</span> if a young person was out of work and receiving unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly half the Bill consists of amendments to the provisions of the Act relating to the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the other amendments in the Bill are based on recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act established the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies as a national research and educational body, the object of which is to try to identify, and disseminate information on, the factors- both negative and positive- affecting marital and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large number of applications from within Australia and overseas were received, and the Attorney-General approved the constitution of an expert panel headed by the Chief Judge of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia to interview applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, after further examination, it was found that the provisions, which were inserted by way of an amendment when the original <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill was before the Senate, were defective in several other respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, most of the other amendments in the Bill are based on recommendations made by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Council, which was also established by the Act, has the function of advising the AttorneyGeneral on the working of the Act and other <span class="highlight">family</span> law legislation, as well as legal aid in <span class="highlight">family</span> law and other matters relevant to this area of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Council’s recommendations included several which it was felt should be implemented at the first opportunity, when the need to amend the provisions of the Act regarding the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies arose, the approval of the Government was also obtained to the inclusion of several of those recommendations in the amending Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members are aware, pursuant to a resolution of the Parliament a joint select committee is currently undertaking a general review of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, when consideration was given to the question of which recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council should be implemented without delay, regard was also had to the question whether implementation of any of the recommendations might preempt the findings of a parliamentary committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the amendments in the Bill are of a technical and non-controversial nature, which do not make substantial changes in any areas of the Act that are singled out by the terms of reference for the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, or which are likely to become the subject of submissions to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the important area of enforcement of orders the Bill makes 3 minor or clarifying amendments, one of which implements a recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also enables the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia and magistrates courts to punish breaches of undertakings given to courts, as well as orders, as contempts of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council on which this is based was prompted by specific cases in which the existing provision of the Act was found to be too narrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill, appeals from magistrates courts to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court will be by way of a complete rehearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976, the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Act extended the opportunity in the original Act for parties to divorce proceedings pending at the commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to have the court decide their case on the ground of divorce under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Bill does is to enable parties in such cases who were not separated for 12 months at the commencement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act but who have since been separated for 12 months to have their cases decided on the ground of divorce under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also extends the power of a court of first instance to state a case to the Full Court of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Western Australia and the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, which still exercises jurisdiction under the Act in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from amendments implementing the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council, the Bill also includes a small number of amendments of a largely formal or minor nature to facilitate the operation of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These concern the powers of courts to transfer, stay or dismiss proceedings, the appointment of members of the Commonwealth Police as marshal and deputy marshals of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court of Australia and appeals from approvals of maintenance agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The feature that is common to all the amendments, including those recommended by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council and those concerning the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies, is that they are intended to facilitate the operation of the Act in the manner originally conceived by the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are placing initial emphasis on <span class="highlight">family</span> involvement, fun, enjoyment and the many and varied ways in which unstructured activity can take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advertisement purports to offer the ‘best value <span class="highlight">family</span> sedan you can buy’ at a mere $5,399. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters have been mentioned in this Parliament and by the media which raise serious questions as to the equity and indeed, the propriety of loans made to the father-in-law of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and <span class="highlight">family</span> companies under or controlled by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer of Victoria has, on the most charitable interpretation, spent three days giving three different answers as to the nature of his professional and business relationship as a solicitor with the Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span> and its trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unacceptable facts are that the circumstances surrounding the loans to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> seem to involve evidence which transgresses the general policy upon which these funds are normally allocated and possibly even the statutory requirements within the relevant Victorian Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we have to consider whether the loan of $50,000 at 10 per cent to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>, in fact, constituted a debt reconstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was from this source that a loan of $50,000 at a rate of interest of 4 per cent was obtained by the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of these transactions was that the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> received $100,000 in loans and $180,000 in compensation from the State Electricity Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has to be remembered is that the funds that were made available to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> were funds which were not available to other Victorian farmers who did not have the capacity to borrow on the open market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, I find it difficult, if not impossible, to believe that the Treasurer of Victoria could presumably accept without being informed a situation in which one <span class="highlight">family</span> and its company could receive assistance to the extent of $ 100,000 by the simple device of splitting mortgages and creating two loans with different rates of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken the Treasurer,  Mr Hamer,  over a week to sort out the complexities of his own professional relationship as solicitor to the Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finish on this note: At least the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> has restructured with some success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does he reconstruct on public money but also he keeps it in the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have individuals within the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> been attacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission has not done anything for the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> that it would not do for others similarly placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is,  Mr Morton-  no representations from anybody in relation to these loans, and the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>’s presentation of its affairs has been exemplary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not content with that, he has also attacked a  Mr Strachan,  who I understand is a solicitor in the firm of Messrs Aitken, Walker and Strachan, and the basis upon which an application apparently was made on behalf of the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman has attacked the probity of the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the loans that have been made to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> are not within that Act; the funds have not been advanced under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, one of the advances made to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> came specifically from funds that are the responsibility of the Victorian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, he has been backed by another statement issued by  Mr Bill  Borthwick, the Victorian Minister of Lands, who, as the Minister responsible within the Victorian Government, examined the application by the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is one which in its narrow ambit is designed to bring some sort of pressure on the Prime Minister, suggesting that because a <span class="highlight">family</span> happens to have a Prime Minister as a brotherinlaw or a son-in-law that <span class="highlight">family</span> should not be entitled to the same assistance as every other member of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our attack is not on the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what we have established in terms of the facts that have already been uncovered in this case study of power is that funds are not distributed equitably, that in fact the treatment that was given to a particular <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Western District was certainly not given to the families in Gippsland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over and above that average of $ 12,000 we find that this particular <span class="highlight">family</span> and company that we are considering received two amounts of money amounting to $100,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to add to that the fact that the State Electricity Commission, after an exhaustive inquiry, reached an out of court settlement with the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> which resulted in a payment which we believe to be about $180,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> received $280,000 of public money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one believes that a <span class="highlight">family</span> of that standing with property of that scale could not raise that kind of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this poor <span class="highlight">family</span> received $280,000 and we are told by the Government that this is equitable treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to this House that the Premier is involved very closely with the Fraser <span class="highlight">family</span> and the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not a farmer in the Western District believed the Premier when he appeared on  PM  and said that he had never heard of the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> received a considerable amount of money from the SEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For God’s sake, it is absolutely incredible to suggest a debt reconstruction loan for a <span class="highlight">family</span> worth $5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That money in fact was given by the Premier of Victoria, through the State Government, to this <span class="highlight">family</span> with no strings attached and with no criteria involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition today concentrated its remarks on the loans paid to the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> by the Victorian Rural Finance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that someone takes some action to rectify the unfortunate allegations cast not only on the Beggs <span class="highlight">family</span> but all the people involved in the fires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is to be given say, a 50 per cent pension, he can present evidence from his own local medical officers, from his employer, from his <span class="highlight">family</span> and from friends indicating he ought to be entitled to a much greater pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 7 June 1978 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made a statement on immigration which held out considerable promise in the field of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion for the ethnic communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He promised changes to make it easier for <span class="highlight">family</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, a major factor sustaining the proportion of gross domestic product represented by income tax and also sustaining the proportion of gross domestic product represented by outlays, more than would otherwise have been the case, has been the removal of concessional allowances for children and their replacement by the new <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangements which transfer expenditures- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problems are also occurring in the <span class="highlight">family</span> law area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our only opportunity to influence the course of events in any foreign situation is provided when we speak out in unison with other countries in the <span class="highlight">family</span> of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also know that for a variety of reasons, personal, <span class="highlight">family</span>, social and economic, some persons who have not been in the work force for a long time may want to come back into the work force, or people who have been in the work force, again for the variety of reasons that I have mentioned, may decide not to try to obtain work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as I have mentioned in the House previously, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Melbourne made that very comment in a letter to the Australian Taxation Office when he said that the failure to act effectively against <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts was destroying the equity of the tax system as between the incidence of taxes on businessmen and that paid by wage and salary earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wage and salary earners cannot avoid the payment of tax by using <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts whereas businessmen have that capability if the Government allows them so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly one can see that the non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers- that is the professional people and the businessmen- are using some device to escape the payment of income tax and, on the evidence, that device overwhelmingly is the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, service trusts and trading trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure to act against <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts in this way destroys this Government’s credibility as a government which is really concerned to eliminate tax avoidance and so increase the equity of the tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government refuses to take measures in respect of tax avoidance on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, which would increase equity in the tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much longer will <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts be allowed as a means whereby the rich escape their tax obligations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ordinary people cannot afford the luxury of a tax haven offered by a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is serious about containing tax avoidance it will do something about the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as income splitting devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer- let me refer to him as Fraser ‘s razor- is out to slash the incomes of wage and salary earners while the wealthy batten on tax avoidance, the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and the absence of capital gains tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the problems evident in <span class="highlight">family</span> law, one has to wonder whether the Commonwealth and the States can ever co-operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, unlike Western Australia, Queensland has not yet moved to establish a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court in Western Australia is operating very successfully, due very much to the efforts of its Chief Justice,  Mr Justice  Barblett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that point because I would not want it thought that we are opposed to the setting up of State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision is already contained in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act and we have no intention of removing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the success of the Western Australian State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court solves only half the problem, that is, the jurisdictional problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 this Parliament decided that the whole subject of <span class="highlight">family</span> law relating to custody and property should be the subject of one Federal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enforcement of the law can, if they wish, be through a State <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill is designed to make necessary changes to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act so that an Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies can be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also makes several relatively minor but nevertheless important amendments to the Act, resulting in the main from the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council has submitted two annual reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very thankful for the fact that it has been able to furnish information as it sees it relating to <span class="highlight">family</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major purpose of the legislation is to cure deficiencies in the Act which have prevented the Institute of <span class="highlight">Family</span> Studies from coining into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act, which was set up to review the Act, does not have the benefit of the researches and studies that would have been available had the Institute been in existence for those three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly, its functions are to promote the identification and understanding of the factors affecting marital and <span class="highlight">family</span> stability in Australia, with the promotion and protection of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as the natural and fundamental unit in society, and to advise the Attorney-General in relation to the making of grants for purposes related to the functions of the Institute and the supervising of the employment of the grants so made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of them deal with the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council through its two annual reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I deal with these amendments I want to make it clear that I do not consider that the establishment of the parliamentary joint committee in any way inhibits action being taken to implement the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Belated recognition has been given to the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council in its first report that persons who commenced actions under the Matrimonial Causes Act should be able to take the benefit of the operation of section 9 (2) of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should always be borne in mind that there will be satisfaction between parties to <span class="highlight">family</span> law matters only when adversary proceedings can be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another amendment is that being made to section 96 of the Act, and this stems from the second report of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular recommendation was that all appeals to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court from courts of summary jurisdiction should be dealt with as complete de novo hearings and that the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court should have unlimited power to hear further evidence in such appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also welcome the fact that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council in its second report for the repeal of section 83 (6). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of matters have been put before the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act relating to the effectiveness of garnishees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will speak briefly to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Amendment Bill because I am Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, very early in the peace when the Committee commenced its deliberations it had the opportunity of speaking with representatives of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This  Bill is designed to pick up those sorts of questions and deal with them, and to enable the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to be more effective, as far as there is substantial agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the activities of the Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act are concerned, I want to report to honourable members that, as I have said when making statements at the public hearings which the Committee has held already, there has been a very large degree of public interest in the Act as it now stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a very game committee that would attempt to act in such a way as to review individual cases, and that certainly has been the approach of the Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to hear that the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is looking at these matters with objectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as one may try to maintain a position of neutrality, if I can call it that, anything connected with <span class="highlight">family</span> law brings with it a very deep feeling of involvement with all parties, whether it be the petitioning husband or the respondent wife or vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The counselling services that are so ably provided under the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act seem to have a great bearing on the decisions reached finally by the judges, and in my experience it is only rarely that there are appeals from a decision of a single judge to the Full Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the circumstances, the review of the existing provisions of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act is being made at a time when that is most necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the  Chairman  of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which is reviewing that Act, on the manner in which he has begun the operations of the Committee and given members a lead as to the way in which the hearings will be conducted: I have not had an opportunity as yet of going into the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council in detail, but I have had the opportunity of observing the whole trend of the approach to this matter by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably I am coming to the conclusion that the title should be: The Destruction of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sat in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court last week and saw seven marriages dissolved in something like 20 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the greatest achievement of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Council would be if it were to come forward and do as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  has suggested and that is to at least recommend to the Government that more counselling facilities be made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this nation rests on the sacredness of the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is timely to remind the House of the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act which has been referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I distinctly remember in this very House in 1975, when this side of the Chamber was in opposition, moving an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act that the period of separation should be two years and not one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably only one home in that street had a normal <span class="highlight">family</span> situation; the other 13 homes were occupied by single parents with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act has an important role to play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I remind the House that, like the honourable member for Fadden  (Mr Donald Cameron),  I moved an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Bill when it was before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act will consider this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so many cases before the <span class="highlight">family</span> law courts, because the parties to the marriage- the husband and the wife- are concerned about their own emotional conflicts, their property disputes and their personal interests in custody or access to children, not enough emphasis is placed upon the interests of the children in having a proper relationship with both their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I raise and which I hope the Committee will consider is the title of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unit with which all of us associate the most is the household unit or, for 95 per cent of the population, the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">family</span> to which the majority of individuals turn in time of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They turn to the <span class="highlight">family</span> for emotional support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They turn to the <span class="highlight">family</span> in time of sickness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They turn to members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> in times when they need someone who is more than a friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if the future of the nation is to be guaranteed and assured we want to make certain that as many Australians as possible have strong <span class="highlight">family</span> ties and emotional support which will enable them to pass through life in a meaningful, happy and satisfying way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If governments by their policies put stresses and strains on the household unit and on the <span class="highlight">family</span> they will create more work for what we today call the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe the court should be called the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That name implies that society as a whole is concerned only with the well being of the <span class="highlight">family</span> when it has reached a breaking point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government- I will not have time to pursue the point this evening- to develop a full and comprehensive <span class="highlight">family</span> policy which concentrates on preventing families from breaking down rather than having to cure the circumstances that have brought about a breakdown and then to provide for the outcome of that breakdown through a heavy burden on the rest of the community by way of economic and other support to children of broken homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means a saving to the Government but it can mean tragic results for the <span class="highlight">family</span> concerned because the income of that <span class="highlight">family</span> is cut off for no reason whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in these terms: Will he introduce legislation to prevent <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts from being used as a tax avoidance measure through income splitting? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Treasurer seen Press reports last week of proposals to introduce a capital gains tax, to introduce a petroleum revenue tax, to terminate <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts and to restructure income tax scales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> trusts should attract about $100m of revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A. Johnson while he was Research Director of the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Planning Centre, St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney, and  Mr D.  B. Roberts, which showed that about 25 per cent of the women who have abortions in Australia are of the Catholic faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one of us in this place has the right to interfere in the advice which a medical practitioner, a clergyman, a member of the <span class="highlight">family</span> or a friend may give to a person who is giving earnest consideration to the termination of her pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The girl, her mother or other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span> must therefore pay the full cost of the operation to abort her father’s child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> may not be able to afford an operation to terminate the mother’s pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances I see two competing moral questions: Should the mother carry that child, thereby causing unwarranted pressure on the <span class="highlight">family</span> and perhaps even placing the <span class="highlight">family</span> unity and wellbeing under threat, or should she have the child aborted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the lack of financial resources or financial support; inability to cope emotionally; <span class="highlight">family</span> size completed or a recent baby; too old; too young to assume parental responsibility; desire to continue studies; desire to avoid a forced marriage; unwillingness to have the baby adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to put up with pressure and abuse from <span class="highlight">family</span>, friends, even hospital staff and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the second group, the disruption to personal and financial relations in the <span class="highlight">family</span> is a major concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women have a variety of responsible reasons for wanting an abortion such as the inability to manage financially; inability to cope emotionally; completion of a <span class="highlight">family</span> or a recent child; no wish to be forced into a marriage; avoidance of <span class="highlight">family</span> strife or parental awareness; ill health; worry about the deformity of a child; and rape or incest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect is not suffered only by the woman; it is suffered by the <span class="highlight">family</span>- the children and the other parent- and society generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the course of my practice a 16-year- old female, one of a <span class="highlight">family</span> of eight, came to me pregnant to her father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Federal MPs were genuinely concerned to discourage abortion, they would be better advised to press for more generous <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and support for single mothers, and to promote sex education and <span class="highlight">family</span> planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament must ask itself: What are the facts in the biological development of a child; is there life at stake in every abortion; what are the possible long term complications to the mother, the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the nation; does an abortion terminate the life of a child or is the so-called foetus just a piece of tissue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no majority support for the anti-abortion position and there is little real support for the position that abortion is to be permitted but that the poor, unmarried girl or the worn out mother of a <span class="highlight">family</span> that is already too large to be given the normal maternal attention should be forced to face the risk of death at the hands of a back yard abortionist because she cannot afford the cost of proper medical treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in a country which has made such wonderful technological advances, in which we have progress and development, it is rather strange that we cannot find a solution to the problem confronting people in this situation and at the same time provide an opportunity for the children they do not want to have love and care and a normal <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes no effort to stress the need for advice on <span class="highlight">family</span> planning and for the prevention of unwanted pregnancies by contraception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some of our submissions put the view that liberal abortion laws would lead to disregard of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services … a disturbing number of abortions are carried out where liberal laws exist; in fact there is evidence from all over the world that where liberal laws regarding abortion exist, there is disregard of <span class="highlight">family</span> planning services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My personal feeling is that in protection of Mother and Child, there should be a continuing responsibility by Governments in regard to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, medical services, child care, education and housing, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am appalled that in a country like Australia, that is experiencing zero population there is no encouragement of <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a country of zero population growth and a population of 14 million people we are worried about our <span class="highlight">family</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think to myself that now I am involved I will see that the <span class="highlight">family</span> will be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would like to provide there the facilities such as jogging tracks about which I spoke earlier with a view to promoting some <span class="highlight">family</span> exercise, but we just do not have the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Concessional deductions for dependent children were abolished, educational deductions are minimal, and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are annually eroded in value because of the Government’s failure to index same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that critics of this viewpoint will argue that, whilst the very existence of life may be a matter of great principle, so too is the quality of that life and that to permit a child to be born into a <span class="highlight">family</span> or to an individual who does not want it or who feels she cannot cope is a greater misfortune than to abort the life of that child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real solution involves many potential elements- improved systems of <span class="highlight">family</span> support, not only financial but also educative, counselling and moral; improved sex education in our schools; improved understanding of human relationships; better <span class="highlight">family</span> planning facilities, and many other elements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The alternative is a supporting mothers’ allowance, a guardians’ allowance, a dependants’ allowance, a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance and supplementary assistance for accommodation because most of the women receiving the supporting mothers’ allowance draw on that benefit- a total cost over 16 years in current terms of $61,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence, at least in relation to one substantial clinic, is that the main reasons persons have gone to have abortions are as follows: Firstly, in 32 per cent of the cases it was felt that future plans might be impaired by a child being born to the mother; secondly, in 35 per cent of the cases it was felt that there would be additional financial strain on the rest of the <span class="highlight">family</span>; thirdly, in 1 7 per cent of the cases it was felt that the girl concerned was too young or too immature to deal with a child; and, fourthly, that in 5 per cent of the cases the woman was pregnant to a man other than her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably we should say that it is abortion on request as a result of a necessity imposed upon the <span class="highlight">family</span> situation or the mother as a result of her own decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more civilised approach would be to introduce more adequate <span class="highlight">family</span> support systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have some respect for honourable members who support the motion moved by the honourable member for Hume if consistently they had supported programs for <span class="highlight">family</span> support and treated it as a vital matter in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any honourable member has an amendment to support the proposition of the honourable member for Hume which will bring the matter closer to reality, then let him move it and demand that the Government bring in <span class="highlight">family</span> support systems adequate to the situation of a person who is faced with a <span class="highlight">family</span> she cannot possibly support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think of all the married couples in Australia who could afford but are unable to adopt babies which would bring them joy and happiness and who would provide them with an opportunity to participate in this wonderful nation and add to the wonderful institution that we call the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does however, make use of FACS regional committees to receive applications for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Support Services Program, and provide information to assist the Commonwealth/State Management Committee to assess applications for funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The aims of the program, which are to encourage the development of services which preserve and strengthen <span class="highlight">family</span> life, promote personal growth, and help people to play an effective part in their community, are similar to the aims of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">Family</span> Support Services Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be argued, though I do not know of anybody outside the Prime Minister’s immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> who would argue it, that self-indulgence on this lavish scale is the province of a Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any event, will he pay attention to the point made by the writer, namely, that if the cost of abortions is to be met by the Commonwealth Government then it has a bounden duty to spend its money in preventing the necessity of abortions by giving more money to <span class="highlight">family</span> planning associations so that proper contraceptive means can be employed, rather than the more costly exercise of dealing with unwanted abortions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe that a greater responsibility is now imposed not just upon the Commonwealth Government, but upon State governments which have a responsibility for administering the laws relating to abortion, to spend more money and to ensure that there is a comprehensive and satisfactory <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program got off the ground there was an incredible deficiency of knowledge in the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that the South Australian Government is already making funds available, but all the State governments should join with the Commonwealth Government in expanding the <span class="highlight">family</span> planning program to avoid the problem of unwanted births and to assist those childless couples in our community who want to have families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Coming more nearly to the question that the honourable gentleman asked, as a result of our tax reforms, indexation, the reform of the rate scales and our introduction of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the taxpayer, on average weekly earnings with a wife and two children, is $15 a week better off under this Government than under  Mr Hayden’s  tax scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">family</span> pays, the children pay and the pensioners pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister says that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance arrangement which the Government has introduced has been of extraordinary benefit to people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that the people in the community with families receiving the <span class="highlight">family</span> benefit today are worse off in real terms than they were at the end of 1975 when they received child endowment and the tax rebate for children which I introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child is $2.17 a week worse off and a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children is $2.06 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that these people are worse off because of the failure of the Government to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has it not indexed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not done so for the same reason as it introduced <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not introduce <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances as a welfare program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it slid them across the board in the Budget under the new heading ‘ <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I am able to point out- the facts confirm it- that today the average income earner or, as the Prime Minister likes to call him in that new matey parlance he has suddenly discovered, the average bloke supporting a wife and two children is, before tax but after consideration is taken of the present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance compared with tax rebates for children and child endowment in effect at the end of 1975, $8.50 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families are worse off because there has been no indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that this Government, despite introducing various measures to reduce tax avoidance, refuses to crack down on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, for instance, is also another indication of the way in which the Government refuses to pursue a tax policy which would be equitable and fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As its own taxation officers pointed out, refusal to crack down on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as tax avoidance measures means that a substantial inequity is allowed to remain in the tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every person in Australia knows the truth about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system allowed people who were paying hide or no tax immediately to receive something meaningful in the post every month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless the discussion is based upon a substantive motion, drawn in proper terms (see page 367), reflections must not be cast in debate upon the conduct of the sovereign, the heir to the throne, or other members of the royal <span class="highlight">family</span>, the Lord Chancellor, the Governor-General of an independent territory, the  Speaker,  the  Chairman  of Ways and Means, Members of either House of Parliament, or judges of the superior courts of the United Kingdom, including persons holding the position of a judge, such as a judge of a Court of Bankruptcy or a county court, or a recorder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have mentioned previously, inter vivos trusts in respect of trading trusts, service trusts and <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts, are tremendously important as a means of tax avoidance in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if it were owned through a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, he would be able to allocate the income to all members of his <span class="highlight">family</span> and reduce the tax payable to only $6,800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That gives honourable members an idea of the enormous amount of tax which can be avoided through income splitting via a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity that the Treasurer has not implemented other recommendations made by the Asprey Committee; for instance, its recommendation in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Asprey Committee recommended all sorts of measures which could be taken, by which <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts could be eliminated as a means of tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be evident to all honourable members that whether one is managing a country, a corner store or a <span class="highlight">family</span> budget there is a limit to financial capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps those gentlemen involved very close to the mark with <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts on the island could explain why the Government is ignoring the tax evasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps other gentlemen in the Cabinet with <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts elsewhere could explain why the tax minimisation is to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The composure of Maureen Stewart and her <span class="highlight">family</span> was testimony to the fact that they believe what Frank Stewart believed; that is, that there is a life after death and that one’s life on earth counts in terms of one’s contribution to others and one’s eternal reward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps on many occasions his <span class="highlight">family</span> did not understand the tests of strength which were put on him, not often in great public speeches but in the corridors and in the Caucus- in those little ways in which a man can have a big influence on the way in which the Parliament works and upon the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who, in a sense, is part of a political <span class="highlight">family</span> I think I can recognise and respect what happens when members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> together serve the public and serve their country in the way they think best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At times I spoke to him about some of the situations in which one found oneself, particularly in terms of the effect on <span class="highlight">family</span> life of the commitment that is required of a Federal parliamentarian and the sacrifices that are made by one’s wife, children and friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790501_reps_31_hor114/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not be possible to initiate welfare initiatives such as <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to a satisfactory level and it will not be possible to index such benefits regularly in order to preserve the real value of those benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not even that tame cat of conservative journalism, the florid pensioner of the Packer <span class="highlight">family</span>, David McNicoll, could seek to excuse this fiasco without at least blushing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, in many instances mothers and fathers write to the people responsible for the administration of the schemes stating that their children have extra confidence and have been able to relate better with other members of their <span class="highlight">family</span> and with society, by virtue of the fact that they have been able to establish inter-personal relationships through the confidence which has been given to them by people indicating that they are concerned about them and interested in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was to be taxed but of course, because of great pressure, the Fraser Government was forced to reverse its policy on that particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the reality is that the Fraser Government introduced the much vaunted <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which is costed in the Budget at something of the order of $ 1,000m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was introduced  with  a promise that it would not be means tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the present Government came into office one of its early and significant social initiatives was to introduce the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question that we must face is whether we will subject a <span class="highlight">family</span> with dependent children to the same tax burden to which we subject a <span class="highlight">family</span> with no dependent children or a single taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would invite all those honourable members who are suggesting that means tests should be put on the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance or that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances should be withdrawn at certain income levels, to ask any woman in a single income household whether she believes the cash benefit should be replaced by a tax rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are netting down the tax paid by the <span class="highlight">family</span> by the amount of the cash benefit that is paid to that <span class="highlight">family</span> by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are adopting and continuing to adopt wrongheaded accounting procedures when we treat as part of public expenditure a cash benefit to a <span class="highlight">family</span> that, in net terms, is paying more to the Government than it is getting back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should increase the horizontal as well as the vertical redistribution of income in favour of families, and not concern ourselves only with <span class="highlight">family</span> poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that some people, however, not only object to the introduction of social dividends- one could say that he is talking about universal payments, and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is a universal payment for children- but consider that there should be no such payments at all at higher levels of income for such children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that Lady Adermann, the honourable Evan Adermann and other members of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, can be very proud of  Sir Charles  Adermann ‘s outstanding record of public service and the fact that he always maintained the very highest standard of public spirited Christian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe not only that we should join together in support of the motion of condolence that has been moved in this place this afternoon and express our sympathy to Lady Adermann and the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the late  Sir Charles  Adermann but also that we should remind ourselves that it is our privilege and our responsibility to serve in the same manner and, I would hope, with the same high standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inequity is in the fact that a two-income <span class="highlight">family</span> can benefit from two zero tax ceilings, which are at present set at $3,893. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This additional <span class="highlight">family</span> ceiling means an advantage to the two-income <span class="highlight">family</span>, based on a taxation rate of 33*/2c in the dollar, of a rebate of at least $ 1 ,304. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us compare that with the position of a single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">family</span> not only is called upon to live off the lesser income inherent in the one income as compared with the two-income <span class="highlight">family</span> but also sees a tax advantage of at least $1,304 go to the multiple income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present recompense for these real home and <span class="highlight">family</span> makers is a pittance of a spouse rebate of $595. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that on the ground of equity alone there should be a further recompense to the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> of this additional rebate of $1,304. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amount could be given as an additional spouse rebate or paid to the mother in the form of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not acceptable, legislation should be prepared to allow once only to a <span class="highlight">family</span> the zero ceiling tax allowance of $3,893. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first alternative of adding to the rebate for the spouse would mean an outlay of further Commonwealth expenditure; the second alternative of restricting one zero ceiling to each <span class="highlight">family</span> would mean the collection of more Commonwealth revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps as a matter of equity the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> situation could be added to any review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pleased to see the <span class="highlight">family</span> approval coming from that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Accepting that this is some measure of compensation, not a capital settlement but income, I invite him to think for a moment of what this represents in the way of income per Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, what does the royalty from Ranger represent per Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dundas may be surprised to know that it represents an annual income per Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> of less than $1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside the argument as to what the money is spent on and leaving aside the argument that most of the money does not get into the individual’s hands, even if all of it got into the individual’s hands each <span class="highlight">family</span> would get less than $1,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the miserable Liberals on the other side of the chamber want to tax a <span class="highlight">family</span> income of $ 1,000 a year at the rate of  6Va  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is applying excessive taxation to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, taxation in excess of that applied to any other Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member completely ignores the fact that very little of this money is going to find its way indirectly into the personal disposable income of any Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not accept the formula of the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  that an imputed $1,000 is to be given to each Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> in the Northern Territory and that it should be taxed because they are getting other income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we divide that $1,000 by five we find that $200 per Aboriginal <span class="highlight">family</span> is the amount that is to be taxed at the rate of 32 per cent- at an income tax rate- the honourable member for Dundas is asking honourable members to believe that a taxable rate of income should be applied to the Aboriginal families in the Northern Territory because of the $200 they will get from these royalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall emphasising at the particular conference that while there are insufficient jobs available- I emphasise that there are insufficient jobs availablethere seems to be no point in pushing young kids into jobs contrary to their wishes, contrary to the benefits to their employers and where another person who has <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibilities and who wants to do that job loses his job or does not get a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make no apologies about avoiding these sorts of impositions on the public by introducing a capital gains tax which would raise about $100m conservatively, a resource rental tax which would raise $150m and a crude oil levy which would raise $450m, and by cracking down on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts- so beloved of the conservatives in the Liberal National Country Party- which would raise $ 100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For instance, he chose to discount the fact that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances were introduced in a way that prevented taxation deductions being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can go home to his <span class="highlight">family</span> and say: ‘I haven’t been sacked; the Commonwealth just used its initiative to retire me, 35 years before I was due to retire’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either he retired or he accepted a job many hundreds of miles away from where he was brought up, had his stakes or lived with his <span class="highlight">family</span>, in which case he would have to pick up stakes and move to a place where one would not send his worst enemy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The number of instances of breakdown in <span class="highlight">family</span> life, of people suddenly, for some unknown reason, finding themselves thrown out of a home, of the collapse of <span class="highlight">family</span> life, or of some such serious incident occurring in households, is now on the increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are supposed to live in a society which is infinitely prosperous, in which human relations are better understood than ever before, but my experience has been that our social services are not yet geared to deal with the tragedies that occur following <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown; that we do not know quite how to handle that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all accept that the Uniting Church and the Catholic Church- indeed all the churches in our electorates- do their very best to assist broken families; but when it comes down to employing permanently people who can help, to finding a refuge for these people, or to these people being told what they should do in these circumstances, I am sorry to say that members of our society still seem to say: ‘Well, it is hard luck for them; it does not happen in my <span class="highlight">family</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the Government and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that upon the agenda of the forthcoming Premiers Conference there shall be placed without fail, at my request and that of this Parliament, an item requiring that a decision be taken as to who is in fact responsible for the support and funding of <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare organisations in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until this is done some people will say that the responsibility to support <span class="highlight">family</span> welfare lies with the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I call upon the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Groom),  who is at the table, to take note of my speech tonight and communicate to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Premiers that I am not prepared to countenance a situation in which there is no proper support, either State or Federal, where there has been a <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown because the State and Federal authorities are quarrelling amongst themselves about who is primarily responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government believe that the cost of supporting a dependent spouse and dependent children should be taken into account in determining a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s capacity to pay tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for Health would not like his <span class="highlight">family</span>, his kids or anybody else for that matter to be at risk and to be exposed to such substances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which was introduced with such a fanfare in 1976 has already fallen by 28 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an undue delay, is it the intention to appoint more <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the latest statistics prepared by the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court show that at the end of April 1979 just over 5,300 cases in the defended lists in all registries were awaiting hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General has said on several occasions that simply appointing more <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court judges will not deal with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that that matter will be the subject of inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member can be well satisfied that the AttorneyGeneral is taking whatever steps are necessary to see that cases before the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Court are speedily dealt with or otherwise is inquiring into the situation to see what might be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To them I say simply that the refugee program is quite separate and distinct from the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion migration program and is a response to an international problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Government has broadened its <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion categories since the refugee problem became obvious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the second highest electorate in New South Wales with respect to people receiving <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree with the suggestion that such people benefit from being able to be kept in the home or the <span class="highlight">family</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These proposals are anti-wage earner, they are anti-householder, they are anti-farmer, and they are anti-<span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those sums would relate to weekly <span class="highlight">family</span> contributions to the basic medical table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the basic weekly <span class="highlight">family</span> table contribution rates for hospital cover are estimatedand against I emphasise only estimated- to rise by amounts ranging from between 65c to about 90c, and for supplementary tables by from 90c to about $1.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he also confirm that changes to the health scheme also announced in the miniBudget will cost the average <span class="highlight">family</span> an extra $4 a week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average weekly earner will have to pay an extra $4 a week for health care, either in the form of insurance or in the form of carrying a risk for himself and his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the House that the removal of the Commonwealth subsidy for medical care and the increase in public hospital charges are certain to have a combined effect of increasing the cost of health insurance for a <span class="highlight">family</span> by approximately $3.50 to $4 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All honourable members know that the  Deputy  Prime Minister has a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust for the purpose of incomesplitting and tax avoidance, yet the House was adjourned two and a half minutes early and before I could raise that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, within the welfare society, we needed to establish the circumstances, particularly in relation to health, in which people would do for themselves what they could properly do for themselves, pay what they could be expected to pay for themselves and be protected by government only when the situation was likely to get beyond an individual’s or a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The health changes will continue to protect pensioners and the socially disadvantaged and will establish the circumstance where people can pay the small bills for themselves but be protected against the major accounts that can completely break any individual or any <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a vision of a liberal society of free, independent people with a pride in being able to do things for themselves- an Australia of growing strength, unequalled as a place to bring up a <span class="highlight">family</span>, unequalled in freedom and unequalled in opportunity; a nation creating our own distinctive culture, our own identity out of the culture and history that so many people have brought to us from so many different lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>3392  (Hansard,  27 March 1979, page 1 194) how much of the $2.1m allocated by the Commonwealth to Victoria over the 3 year period through the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Support Services Program already has been granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have the grants been publicised as being provided by the Commonwealth or have they been hidden in the Victorian <span class="highlight">Family</span> and Community Services Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 million allocated to Victoria over the 3 year period for the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Support Services Scheme, a total of $1,416,389 has been approved, covering the funding of service projects in the first and second years of the Scheme and specific amounts for evaluation in each of the three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of those, 402,800 people were not looking for work because of personal or <span class="highlight">family</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These tax proposals and the other proposals announced in the mini-Budget the other night, including the final burying of Medibank, will cost the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man at least another $10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest tax avoidance racket in this country today is the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust mechanism - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to be effective there must be equality of opportunity for every individual to cope with his environment, occupation, community, <span class="highlight">family</span> relationships, work and leisure time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would mean providing each <span class="highlight">family</span> with a ticket representing the real cost of providing that <span class="highlight">family</span>’s children with a standard approved education, a ticket which the <span class="highlight">family</span> could then spend at the school of its choice, paying additional funds if it wished for any non-standard features a particular school might provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Schools Commission’s excellent project for devolution of educational authority, including financial authority, I assert can best be implemented by funding the consumer, that is, the child attending school or his <span class="highlight">family</span>- not the school directly or the system, but the child whose education, whose life therefore, is what this whole operation is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equal needs are not being met with equal aid, which is why I recommend that the Schools Commission’s needs policy should be applied to each <span class="highlight">family</span> and not to institutions, whether public or private, attended by children from quite different socioeconomic backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the 48 per cent increase in the consumer price index from 1975-76 to 1979-80 mean that the value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children has declined by $3.70 over the last five years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances mean that the Government is being dishonest with families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very simply, the facts of the matter are that this Government has given to Australian families, through the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, one of the most revolutionary social reforms that this country has seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was introduced it was hailed not only by members of this side of the House; it was acknowledged also by members of the other side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition now have a fondness for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme that was not evident when they were in office between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a very significant increase in costs to every Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> since November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s argument about the effect of spiralling health care costs for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> is obviously wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of interest that if the tax rates applying when Labor lost office in 1975 applied today the average <span class="highlight">family</span> would be paying $ 1 6 a week more in tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>calls upon the Government to allocate sufficient funds to enable programs to commence immediately, to increase job and training opportunities for the young unemployed and to make subsidies available direct to employers in order that <span class="highlight">family</span> heads and elderly workers can be kept in employment, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this House, mindful of the principles and philosophy of the Liberal Party to assist those in need, is anxious to protect the <span class="highlight">family</span> and single people in the lower income groups from the worry of bills and charges for medical or hospital treatment due to illness or an accident, and therefore requests the Minister for Health to advise the medical profession that a confidential letter from a local justice of the peace, minister of religion, industrial chaplain or an officer of the Citizens Advice Bureau, Social Security or Welfare or Probation, in relation to any patient, shall entitle that medical practitioner to accept the patient as ‘disadvantaged’ and refer any charges to the Commonwealth for payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with a dependent spouse and two children will be $4.92 a week worse off in real terms after tax as a result of this year’s Budget as against the position last financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, would a before tax increase of $7.35 a week above what the Government is forecasting be necessary this year merely to maintain the real after tax living standard of this average single income Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was revealed halfway through the hearing that the chief witness,  Mr Bruce  Gordon, did not own Oberon Broadcasters Pty Ltd, the <span class="highlight">family</span> company making the $4.5 million purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not be under any misapprehension about this matter: The business stays in a cosy <span class="highlight">family</span> group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Gyngell said he had withdrawn from the WIN4 hearing and did not vote on last week’s decision because of his long association with  Mr Gordon,  who had looked after  Mr Gyngell  ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span> company, Warooka Pty Ltd, while he was in England between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this basis it would take at least four years for a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children and one income earner on average weekly earnings to save the deposit to buy a $35,000 home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assumption is that the <span class="highlight">family</span> can save onequarter of its income during that period to bridge the deposit gap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of Your people throughout the Commonwealth of Australia, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty and other members of the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> in Your personal loss and we mourn the loss sustained by the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and indeed the whole world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House expresses its horror and shock at the violence which was perpetrated upon Earl Mountbatten of Burma and upon his <span class="highlight">family</span> and condemns this type of action as a breach of all that is humane and reasonable in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion moved by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  expresses the horror and the shock of this House at the violence perpetrated upon Earl Mountbatten and his <span class="highlight">family</span>, and properly condemns it as a breach of all that is humane and reasonable in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is compounded when so many others, including <span class="highlight">family</span> members, die or suffer as a result of such a shocking attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By his closeness to it he helped the Royal <span class="highlight">Family</span> in many ways, not least by his bearing, his demeanour and his devotion to public service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Treasurer acknowledge in the same speech that the case of the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> has growing support amongst his parliamentary colleagues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the position of families is concerned, this Government has a record since it was elected in December 1975, through its Budgets and its other economic decisions, of giving support to the <span class="highlight">family</span> which is the envy of other political parties in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance system, which was greeted by many members of the Opposition with exclamations of ‘Why didn’t we think of that when we were in government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It grossly misrepresents the impact of its decisions on the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then after being slugged these higher health costs the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> on average weekly earnings will get an alleged tax cut of $4.50 a week on 1 December- three months later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an unemployment Budget which will reduce the jobs available to bread winners, to working wives and to young <span class="highlight">family</span> members wanting to enter the work force for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a higher inflation Budget which will erode <span class="highlight">family</span> income and stability through rising prices for essential foods and household goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By failing to increase or index basic social welfare benefits the Budget permits a drastic erosion of payments on which many disadvantaged <span class="highlight">family</span> units are dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inflation has progressively eroded the value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances so that in real terms a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children is now $3.26 a week worse off than it was in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if adjustments are made for expenditure on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, the increased eligibility nevertheless means that expenditure on social security and welfare as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76, Labor’s last Budget, to 21 per cent in the current Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People should always remember that, leaving aside all this verbiage from the Labor Party, if the Hayden tax scale were operating today the average <span class="highlight">family</span> would be paying $16 a week more in tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others include increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowanceseither an increased spouse’s allowance or a form of <span class="highlight">family</span> taxation to assist single income families- reduced excise on low alcohol beer, a fourth year for the aged person’s capital grants scheme and a scheme to assist those disadvantaged by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On top of that this Budget in the tax area alone, and making allowances for <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, disadvantaged him to the extent of a further $7.92. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An amount of $125 out of $160 a week leaves $35 a week upon which a <span class="highlight">family</span> of two adults and two youngsters has to live; $35 a week for food, recreation and clothing and other essentials to which any <span class="highlight">family</span> should be entitled in a wealthy country like ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is the case, we ought to ask ourselves, firstly, this very simple question: What is the greatest destroyer of living standards, job security, personal security and <span class="highlight">family</span> security of Australians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing so undermines the security of a <span class="highlight">family</span>, the sense of wellbeing of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and the sense of togetherness of a <span class="highlight">family</span> and gives it a greater sense of desperation than a spiralling level of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not hear anything -from the Opposition about the fact that in 1976 this Government introduced undeniably the most valuable social reform for the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>, namely, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What that has to do with the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> I do not know, except that, as a result of this Government’s extravagant approach to overseas borrowing, the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the future is to be landed with the debt which this Government has placed on its head in terms of the repayments of the loans which it has borrowed in the last couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> which is carrying the burden of this Government’s mismanagement, not the wealthy families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has taken the Government four years to close a loophole which has been used as a tax avoidance measure by the wealthiest families in this country, namely, the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the misuse of the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust, the wealthiest families of this country have, in fact, made quite profitable use of the fact that they have a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right if someone belongs to a rich <span class="highlight">family</span>; he can make money out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is when someone belongs to a poor <span class="highlight">family</span>, a low income <span class="highlight">family</span>, that this Government decides to screw him to the wall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only in the last few months that this Government has belatedly got round to closing the loophole of the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mind you, of course, this was after the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  signalled that he was getting out of his <span class="highlight">family</span> trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has now decided to close the loophole of the <span class="highlight">family</span> trust; except, of course, for the wealthiest people in the country for whom it will still be profitable to order one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> affairs around <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts so as to avoid tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing magic about the idea of the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a means of social organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the effect of the trauma on the ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> resulting from unemployment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this House a week ago he was able to say quite boastfully that this year the purchasing power of the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> will, in fact, decline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the man who is part of the Government which, a few years ago, held out great promise, which turned out to be fatuous, for the average Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see so many of the attacks which have been made against the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One low income <span class="highlight">family</span> which has been particularly singled out for treatment by the Government is the <span class="highlight">family</span> of a student who has to survive on the tertiary education allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what do they do when students als provide the <span class="highlight">family</span> income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> of a student with a dependent spouse and two children is worse off to the extent of $2 1 a week now than he was in 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody applauded <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances when they were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This side of the House too applauded the Government for the introduction of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, but we have seen, little by little, the value of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance being eroded over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of this Government to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances has meant that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for one child has lost its value to the extent of nearly $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The loss to a <span class="highlight">family</span> with five children has been $7.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an indication of this Government’s commitment to the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows the rich still to make a profit out of having a <span class="highlight">family</span> while it relentlessly assaults the living standards of ordinary families in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person on such a low income or any member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> is sick, attends a doctor and obtains an average of two prescriptions per consultation, he will have to pay $5.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its two paragraphs say nothing about the equity of the proposal before us, nothing about the burden to the ill who require numerous prescriptions, nothing at all about the problems of disadvantaged patients, and nothing at all about the fact that this measure will again strike particularly at the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> with a large number of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we recognise that the Government has introduced this change because it is totally insensitive to what that kind of change means to a lower income <span class="highlight">family</span>, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with perhaps a number of children, a <span class="highlight">family</span> in which there is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s moves on income tax will secretly occasion an increase in taxes for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all the Government’s much heralded tax reforms, it is accurate and objective to say that the average <span class="highlight">family</span> man and middle income earners are marginally worse off than they were when this Government first, unscrupulously, came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regressive measures that this Government has introduced since it came to office include the personal income tax restructuring in 1978, a tax on social security benefits, the abolition of estate and gift duty, the excise duty increases in 1978-79, the customs duty increases in 1978-79, non-indexation of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the abolition of the property component in the means test, less frequent indexation of pensions, the freezing of unemployment benefits, the moves to payment in arrears, harassment of recipients, freezing of rates for juniors, non-indexation for those without dependants, the abolition of the maternity allowance, the cut in the Aboriginal programs, the complete destruction of Medibank, the composition of education funds, cuts in urban public transport funds, the reduction in the coal levy, oil pricing at import parity, the investment allowance, and the increase in the retention allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the raising of the tax threshold, the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, the tax on lump sum leave payments, the departure tax, the technical and further education scheme and the training schemes, and the unemployment benefit for farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One advantage young people may have in gaining a job is to have <span class="highlight">family</span> connections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means another increase in the cost of health care to the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Remember the big story about the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, which was much mooted as a great aid to them, has had its value completely eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If the 1978-79 tax scale is compared with that for 1975-76, for people on various levels of real income, including <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances as a replacement on tax rates, the combined effect is regressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those in the same <span class="highlight">family</span> position, but on $30,000, had the greatest improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the face of the one who is cunningly and crudely convincing nations that nationalism is outlived, that religion is the affair of old women, and that the <span class="highlight">family</span> is old-fashioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Moonie cult have succeeded in enticing fine young men and women from their <span class="highlight">family</span> life and have brainwashed them in such a way that their parents no longer have any influence over them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is $6 for a <span class="highlight">family</span>, and every dollar earned over that is a direct reduction on their income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much for <span class="highlight">family</span> life and the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> men and women realise that this Budget disadvantages them greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The taxpayer with <span class="highlight">family</span> dependants is the big loser under the Fraser Government’s new tax scales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst those who receive the 9 per cent increase in income predicted in the Budget, the <span class="highlight">family</span> breadwinner will be by far the most disadvantaged in the whole of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well publicised and proven tables show the plight of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man on average weekly earnings, which according to the Bureau of Statistics are $240 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to what I was saying about the plight of the <span class="highlight">family</span> man who earns these mythical average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> man earning $12,000 in 1978- 79 will suffer a 5.7 per cent tax increase in 1 979- 80, but the single taxpayer will suffer only a 2.6 per cent rise- that is, less than half that which the <span class="highlight">family</span> man will pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the results are startling, but the <span class="highlight">family</span> man with dependents earning $6,000 will suffer a massive 135 per cent effective tax increase compared with the single taxpayer’s increase of 13.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the increase will be 10 times as much for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man on minimal wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At $7,000 the tax rise for the <span class="highlight">family</span> may is 32 per cent compared with 9 per cent for the single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At $8,000 the tax rise for the <span class="highlight">family</span> man is 18 per cent compared with 6 per cent for the single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So every working man with a <span class="highlight">family</span> is now up for an extra $3.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not have the back-up support that some other person might have of living in a stable <span class="highlight">family</span> existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask leave of the House to move a motion to amend the resolution of appointment of the Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act to extend the time for the bringing up of the report of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worth noting that after 1 December a taxpayer on average earnings, and having a wife and two children, will be $20 a week better off as a result of our reforms and as a result of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances than he would have been under Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have called for a national <span class="highlight">family</span> policy; I have urged the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> impact statements; I have called for increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances; and I have advocated tax reform in the interests of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it will give similar attention to a number of other important proposals including those which, if accepted, will result in increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the abolition of the pension income test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of <span class="highlight">family</span> income support for children should not be confused with the relief of absolute poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the tax changes in 1 975-76 were positive steps in the right direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a country we lag behind many others in <span class="highlight">family</span> policies and <span class="highlight">family</span> income support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> lobby groups must become more influential and press more strongly the interests of the <span class="highlight">family</span>, so that tax and social security policies are reformed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of these policies should be to ensure that the standard of living of a <span class="highlight">family</span> with children compares favourably, or at least not intolerably badly with a <span class="highlight">family</span> with no dependent children or with that of a single income man or woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now, the Australian system of taxation and social security has had comparatively little effect on levelling out the fluctuations in income requirements associated with an individual ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span> life cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also declared that it was the Commission’s view that ‘the care of <span class="highlight">family</span> needs is principally a task for governments’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding this clear statement, governments, both Liberal and Labor, have gone on pretending to themselves and to the public that a breadwinner’s wage is adequate, firstly, to keep a <span class="highlight">family</span> with children above some ill-defined poverty line and, secondly, to enable it to cope with the increasingly expensive task of giving children a fair start in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as the two systems are separate and one is based on the individual and the other on the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit, no patching up will be successful and our income support arrangements will be more costly than they should be and our taxation system will remain unfair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This we should do because the welfare of any individual is a function not so much of his own income but of the combined income of the <span class="highlight">family</span> or household of which he or she is a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, a <span class="highlight">family</span>’s tax liability is not assessed according to taxable capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is largely determined by the proportions in which each spouse earns the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two-income families pay much less tax than the <span class="highlight">family</span> in which one spouse is the only breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, single-income families with incomes under $16,608 pay $707 a year or $13.60 a week more in tax than twoincome families with the same <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the household income rises that tax advantage in favour of the two-income <span class="highlight">family</span> rises to $60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes insufficient account of <span class="highlight">family</span> commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It regards most expenditure of a dependent spouse and dependent children as a way in which taxpayers choose to enjoy their after-tax income and not as a measure of the increased needs of the <span class="highlight">family</span> or its reduced taxable capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> should be taxed according to its ability to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong that tax cuts should be available to those who can arrange their affairs so that they can split their <span class="highlight">family</span> income but denied to those who cannot or choose not to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax cuts given in this way will not provide the answer to the problem facing <span class="highlight">family</span> taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But optional <span class="highlight">family</span> income splitting could be phased in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, reform has been retarded; but now that indexation has been suspended, let us keep it that way until we have a tax system that is fair to all taxpayers and seen to be fair by them all; otherwise, tax minimisation will and should become the proper concern of every <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no grounds on which those who put their <span class="highlight">family</span>’s interests first in this way can be called tax avoiders, except perhaps by those who are blind to the inequities of the present tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Selective indexation should continue for a new optional <span class="highlight">family</span> tax scale until it places single-income families in the same position as two-income households who split their incomes under the present arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The phasing in of these reforms would be facilitated by the introduction of a new optional <span class="highlight">family</span> tax scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, the per capita income of a taxpayer and his dependent spouse which is tax-free, is $2,837 compared with $3,893 per capita for members of a <span class="highlight">family</span> splitting their income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At current inflation rates, indexation on the optional <span class="highlight">family</span> tax scale without interruption since the last adjustment would mean that, within three years, the amount of taxfree income available to all families would be unaffected by the proportions in which the spouses earn the <span class="highlight">family</span> income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the thresholds in the new <span class="highlight">family</span> income tax scale rose as a consequence of indexation, at first 1 V4 million single income households would receive substantial tax cuts and later more would do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the Government were to index the tax scales it could accelerate the rate at which the new <span class="highlight">family</span> tax system was brought into operation, or it could use that revenue to increase substantially and maintain the real value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that since the end of 1975 real disposable income for a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children has fallen by 5.5 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that to return the purchasing power of this representative <span class="highlight">family</span> to its 1975 level would require an after tax increase in income of $ 1 1 .40 a week or a pay increase of $17 a week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition we have introduced a policy of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to assist the lower income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a wife and two children will be $20 a week better off because of our tax reforms and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances than he would have been under Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Grants to autumn centres throughout Australia have been increased and <span class="highlight">family</span> services programs have been extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the ethnic health workers- would play a key role in preventing the development of serious health problems and the <span class="highlight">family</span> breakdown and major settlement problems often associated with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put it in the words of the <span class="highlight">family</span>: You and your families can spend only as much as you can earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now refer to taxation which is very important to the average person and the average <span class="highlight">family</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  made a statement on 26 July about what one could call the abolition of the system whereby <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts could be used as a tax avoidance measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that on 9 May 1978 my colleague, the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  asked the Treasurer a question about the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts for tax avoidance purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer, in his reply, said that income splitting by the use of <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts was not tax avoidance; it was tax minimisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Treasurer has decided that the use of minor children in <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts for income splitting purposes is a tax avoidance measure and that it will be outlawed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, he still allows <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts for husband and wife for income splitting purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a man who earns $40,000 a year and who has a <span class="highlight">family</span> trust consisting of himself and his wife, the tax liability is reduced by almost 30 per cent or $4,600 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A group of backbenchers yesterday called on the Federal Government to review plans to clamp down on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts as the tax debate raged inside and outside Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members argued that many people had set up <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts to avoid death duties and probate rather than inocme tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at some of the people who have been involved in <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to deal, in the little time available, with a very vital question concerning this community, and that is the <span class="highlight">family</span> and the way in which it is being hit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the <span class="highlight">family</span> is the cornerstone of our community and of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should look at the effect on the <span class="highlight">family</span> of the tax increases which will occur over the coming year as a result of the increase in average weekly earnings and the increase in the inflation rate which is engendered by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the ultimate, the <span class="highlight">family</span> will pay more taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, this Budget can best be described as being a continuing attack on the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> unit and a treatment by this Government of the sons and daughters of Australians as being dispensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, the Government’s latest Medibank fiddle will cost nearly everyone more, and although  Mr Howard  can honestly say this is not a tax increase, the distinction will not be apparent in <span class="highlight">family</span> budgets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other area I want to refer to is <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are supported by members on both sides of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances came the abolition of tax deductible allowances for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An average single income <span class="highlight">family</span> of four will be about $7.90 a week worse off through the overall impact of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has dealt particularly savagely with the single income <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done nothing about <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table shows quite clearly that under the tax rebate system which was introduced during the last Hayden Budget, the tax rebate per child, indexed as taxation has been indexed until this year, would have been $5.60 per week per child for a tax paying <span class="highlight">family</span> plus 50 cents child endowment for the first child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for the first child is $3.50 compared with the $6.10 paid previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a <span class="highlight">family</span> with one child loses $2.60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the table shows that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with two children loses $4.20 a week, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children loses $5.80 a week, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">family</span> has six children it loses over $10 a week because of the Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government has attacked the <span class="highlight">family</span> in every possible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has continually attacked the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since 1976, the wholesale price of petrol has increased from 60c a gallon to more than $1.20 a gallon- or approximately $7.20 extra a tankfull for the average <span class="highlight">family</span> car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has even less concern for the single income <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme, introduced by this Government, was another hoax which it perpetrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the hoax which the Government has perpetrated, the amounts payable under the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme have remained unchanged despite the fall caused by inflation in the value of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On top of that, for the third year in a row there is no rise in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real disposable income of wage earner households will decline because of reduced real wages, increased real taxes and reduced real <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The real fall in the value of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances impinges most heavily on low income earners because the allowances are a higher proportion of their total income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not to increase <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances in line with inflation provides a greater impost on the incomes and living standards of low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the last few weeks since becoming a member of Parliament I have come to know, as has my <span class="highlight">family</span>, many of the tribulations that members of Parliament put up with that the general community has not been aware of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has been living on credit for the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance which it introduced some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think everyone in the Parliament would agree that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was a good innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances this year even though it seems to think that is the jewel in its social welfare crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at the amount of funds provided for long day care and <span class="highlight">family</span> day care schemes in Victoria and compares that with what was being spent in New South Wales one sees where the Government’s political  airlegiances  lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of this increase would have been offset because of the taxing of pensions and benefits and the change from a child tax rebate to a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if adjustments are made for spending on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, expenditure on social security and welfare as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76 to 2 1 per cent in 1979-80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In only four instances in the <span class="highlight">family</span> groupings with one, two, three, four or five children and so on do families living on the pension or unemployment benefit receive a weekly income above the poverty line, that is, a married couple without children on the pension and a married couple with six or seven children on the pension, If the same married couple with six or seven children is on the unemployment benefit however, they are living more than $6 a week below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me refer to another matter that seriously affects the Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> and on which this Government gave some commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The extent by which other services to support a <span class="highlight">family</span> have been cut by the Fraser Government can be illustrated by the following figures prepared by the Statistical Service of the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year he will be some $7.90 a week worse off just because of the tax policies and the failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average <span class="highlight">family</span> today just is not living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Family</span> allowances are being rapidly eroded by inflation and the Government’s refusal to adjust them for inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will find that his standard of living this year will be 6.6 per cent lower than it was in 1975-76 as a result of the reduction in his real wages, increases in his tax burden and the nonadjustment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government given any indication of when it will stop increasing the proportion of income paid in tax or when it will start the adjustment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In reality, a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> is out of the race to buy a home under the present circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Generally, the policies of the Labor Government were totally haphazard and did nothing to assist young home buyers in Australia and nothing to assist the industry to produce houses for young families or any <span class="highlight">family</span> who wanted to get into a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For particular <span class="highlight">family</span> reasons he felt deeply about the issue involved, as did hundreds and thousands of other Victorian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For persons 35 to 45 the average duration of unemployment is 34 weeks; and asserting that the lengthening period of unemployment for <span class="highlight">family</span> heads has repercussions in social costs for which Australia will pay over the next generation, is of the opinion that the Federal Government should provide financial assistance to State and local government for adult job creation, training and retraining schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can completely cover one’s <span class="highlight">family</span> under a health scheme for all eventualities for less than $ 1 ,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an active immigration policy with denned objectives over rolling three-year periods; we have relaxed <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion entry categories in a responsible way; we have introduced new opportunities for independent applicants to be considered for migration under a systematic selection system known as NUMAS, which is based on the collective experience of settlement in this country over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP’s immigration policy is a very imprecise one but it does say that <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion must have a high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might ask what is meant by <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement on a new approach to immigration and community relations, the Opposition spokesman said that <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion is a concept that includes: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of nit-picking approach by the Opposition spokesman obscures the fact that we are accepting large numbers of persons on humanitarian grounds such as Indo-Chinese refugees, Soviet Jews, Timorese, Eastern European refugees, and large numbers of persons on compassionate <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take a different approach and look at the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion and refugee categories- the groups the Opposition would give priority to- 73 per cent of those indicating they would be seeking employment were in the unskilled, semi-skilled or not classified categories, the very groups in greater difficulty in finding employment under current circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One remembers well the eulogies in this House by Government members about the Government transfer of the former provision of tax rebates in respect of children to increased <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition was told by the Government, not altogether honestly, that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was actually a new reform and that new money was being pumped into the <span class="highlight">family</span> through this system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme is now very much like the scheme which was introduced in 1950 when another conservative government came to power on a promise to pay child endowment for the first child- an appeal to greed rather than need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, that promise was honoured and in 1950 a five shilling child allowance fee was paid in respect of the first child to each <span class="highlight">family</span> entitled to receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme is shaping up in exactly the same way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes in arrangments that took place in 1976 were said to be the greatest advance in care and understanding of the <span class="highlight">family</span> by any government in modern times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refused to index the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments and therefore it is allowing those amounts to depreciate through inflation to amounts which are insignificant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who would have gained under the tax rebate system are gaining nothing extra now because of the change to the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of this Government have talked and beaten hollow drums about their concern for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and yet they are presiding over a situation where in every respect the levels of support for families, on a government basis, are being eroded by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the imposition of selective indirect taxes to the massive extent of $3 billion via the oil excise levy and the petrol tax at the pump, the final burial of Medibank and, finally, the erosion of real wages and <span class="highlight">family</span> living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that loss we can add the real loss in <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances are the same as they were when they replaced concessional taxation rebates for children back in 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If half-yearly indexation had been applied, as it ought to have been, to those <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances they would have risen, respectively, by $ 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a <span class="highlight">family</span> with three children is losing $4.70 a week because of this Government’s failure to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and a <span class="highlight">family</span> with four children is losing $6.70 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of taxation, as a result of the latest tax mix, a <span class="highlight">family</span> with an income of $12,000 a year is paying $322 a year more in taxation, or $6 a week, as a result of the failure to implement full tax indexation and the failure to remove the surcharge of 2.5 cents in the dollar until 1 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the losses that have already occurred in real wages, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and taxation, it is not surprising that the trade union movement has knocked back what amounts to only a con trick upon the wage and salary earners of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total of unemployment benefits and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for a married couple with two dependent children is approximately $ 1 12.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for two dependent children represents approximately 3.7 per cent of the same figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The total of unemployment benefits and <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance for a married couple with two dependent children represents approximately 48.5 per cent of preliminary seasonally adjusted AWE for the June quarter 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are probably as many unemployment benefit formulae as there are schemes, and quoting random national examples of them for international comparison would at best be meaningless, if only because their value to the recipients depends on other factors such as benefit duration, the number of waiting days, if any, and the treatment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances, if any, during the benefit period- factors which, like the operation of earning ceilings in contribution and benefit calculation, can influence the actual structure of benefit rates enacted’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Revision of sections 62 and 63 of the Migration Act 1958, which provide for offences in respect of the removal and carriage from Australia of children in respect of whom custody or access orders have been made or are being sought, to give them broader application, and relocation of the provisions to the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Law Act 1975 where their existence should become more generally known; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this way, the <span class="highlight">family</span> as a unit receives the benefit of increased pensions and allowances and the primary purpose of Repatriation pensions as compensation for disabilities related to service is achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to put forward views as to the correctness or otherwise of married women holding jobs but I think that in assessing unemployment the community needs to take that fact into account and to make a very careful assessment as to whether there should be two wage earners in the one <span class="highlight">family</span> when others are on the unemployment list or whether full-time work should be limited to one wage earner per <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He does that in conflict with evidence that was given to him by counsel on my behalf of the circumstances whereby I had made a number of letters available to other shareholders, including the Walsh <span class="highlight">family</span>, and an acknowledgment by the special investigator in the course of that transcript of evidence that if it had gone to the Walsh <span class="highlight">family</span>, as he quotes on page LXI of the preview: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has been frozen at the same level for three years prices have escalated by 30 per cent, spending on education has been reduced, child care services have been starved of funds and housing has become dearer and dearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It commenced by saying that we should work towards, firstly, placing a ceiling on selected prices, from hospital costs to gas, oil and basic food items such as bread and milk; secondly, we ought to expand our supplies of basic commodities such as housing by way of selected mortgage assistance, conservation of synthetic fuels, the introduction of consumer co-operatives, <span class="highlight">family</span> farm aid and more direct marketing of food; and thirdly, we should establish new public- not governmentinstitutions such as energy corporations and health maintenance institutions to force the big corporations to compete both openly and more efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to that, the ordinary motorist who for years has had a sixcylinder car- the six-cylinder medium compact that does something like 16 to 20 miles to the gallon is a sort of standard Australian <span class="highlight">family</span> car- will suffer a very heavy impost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as well I think there is the legitimate question which people have to ask themselves and that is, when does <span class="highlight">family</span> responsibility end and State responsibility begin? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is somewhat extraordinary that a deportation order should be served against a person, even though he be in gaol, and his <span class="highlight">family</span> not be informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This deportation order denied him the opportunity to return to his <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the idea was to deal with the matter quietly- to put him on an aircraft and to send him awaybecause his <span class="highlight">family</span> were not told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sent a message to the Minister to ask that he be in the chamber at 1 1 o’clock tonight to explain to this House and to me why a deportation order was served without the <span class="highlight">family</span> being informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would be perfectly willing to agree to the whole <span class="highlight">family</span> being deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, I would be much happier if the offender, having served his sentence, were allowed to join his <span class="highlight">family</span> in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After considering most carefully all the circumstances, including  Mr Grunau  ‘s <span class="highlight">family</span> situation- I say at this stage that the honourable member for Holt does not have a mortgage on human compassion and human concern in relation to these matters; all members of parliament feel very strongly about these sorts of situations- I directed that he should be deported in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>From the continuing reports of maltreatment of the Timorese population by Indonesian authorities and the obstruction of the <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion programme, the fears expressed by the Timorese appear to be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another important question is whether the International Red Cross officials will be permitted to probe into the sensitive areas of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, tracing and the question of political prisoners, traditional functions of the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I refer the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to an explanation he gave on 30 August this year in which he said that migrants coming to Australia fell into four categories- <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, refugees, those entering by virtue of the Tasman agreement and persons who were selected because of their occupational skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is payable in periods which commence on the fifteenth day of one month and end on the fourteenth day of the next month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can mean that a person or institution having the care of a child for the greater part of a period but not the commencement, receives nothing by way of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance in respect of that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly stated, the conditions for payment of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance apply also to double orphan’s pension and handicapped child’s allowance, but handicapped child’s allowance is not payable to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Consequently the absence of a child from the <span class="highlight">family</span> home for a few days covering the commencement of a <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance period can result in the non payment to the parent or guardian of amounts of $47.70 and $65 a month respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of a handicapped child ‘s allowance, the absence of a child from the private home for a short period can be disregarded and payment continued uninterrupted provided <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance continues to be payable to the parent or guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, under existing conditions if a child enters an institution to which <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance is payable the parent or guardian loses handicapped child ‘s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only that, but I will bring forward evidence to show that for the greater part of our population it is not possible for members of a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> to get their feet on the first rung of the ladder, that is, getting a loan to build or buy their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This decision not only discriminates against resident migrants seeking to bring additional <span class="highlight">family</span> members to Australia, but ensures that many people approved under NUMAS for settlement in Australia as independent migrants will be pushed to the end of the ever growing dole queues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that until 1 January immigration policy covered these categories: <span class="highlight">Family</span> reunion, special <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, refugees, persons freely granted residence because of the Tasman agreement, and the general eligibility provision wherein independent new migrants were selected mainly by relating their skills to the Australian 1 mainly abour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from people admitted as refugees and for <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, migrant entry criteria should be developed on the basis of benefit to the Australian community, and the social, economic and related requirements within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition policy to give <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion a high priority and to extend it to brothers, sisters and generally to non-dependent relatives has very serious repercussions for the labour market and shows a great disregard for the unemployed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, in the administration of a sensibly controlled intake this Government has been able to accommodate the basic domestic constraints of the Australian economy, and at the same time sensibly meet the immediate <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion requirements of our migrant population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me point out to the House that amongst those pensions which are not being indexed are the supplementary allowance, which for some considerable time has been $5 and which now should really be indexed to $8 and the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the question of the placing of a means test on <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ALP has constantly criticised the Liberal-National Country Party’s <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP platform speaks of ‘reviewing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance programs in order to direct resources to low income families ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was considered desirable not to add to government spending, a reduction in the <span class="highlight">Family</span> Allowances could pay for the increased supplement paid to lower income groups, e.g., a reduction of $4 per month per child would have resulted in approximately $200m in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A married man with two children would have received, including <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance, some 50.5 per cent of average weekly earnings while unemployed compared with 48.4 per cent at the end of the term of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, there is payment of the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance on a daily basis for a child moving between parents and an institution or between one person and another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, my colleagues, particularly the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  and  Senator Bishop,  played a key role in drawing the attention of the responsible Minister to anomalies in specific cases arising from the monthly payments of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the Fraser Government likes it or not, it has a responsibility to see that no <span class="highlight">family</span> or individual lacks food and shelter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government is not only taking away the right to unemployment benefit; it is even taking away the right to special benefit, a payment made only when a person or <span class="highlight">family</span> is destitute, without money and without any prospect of raising it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, for example, a husband and wife are in the same union and the wife voted against strike action and was not involved in it, the <span class="highlight">family</span> still cannot receive any benefit, even if the breadwinners are supporting children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer firstly to the suggestion that these people are somehow the product of <span class="highlight">family</span> conditions, personal attitudes and perhaps their immediate social environment, rather than their being in any sense the victims of larger social forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past few years we have seen major programs of urban renewal and the tendency for office areas within a city to expand into neighbouring suburbs and for properties that have been used for perhaps 30 or 40 years as rooming houses to be taken over for commercial purposes or sometimes turned into large <span class="highlight">family</span> homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Soviet Government regards emigration as an unpatriotic act and has virtually restricted it to the concept of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion, which is applied to those Soviet nationalities that can be seen to have a homeland abroad, such as Jews and Germans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can pay up to $17 a week- $884 a year- for comprehensive <span class="highlight">family</span> insurance and trust that one gets one’s money’s worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures show that the average first home buyer in Australia is a young <span class="highlight">family</span> purchasing a house costing about $34,000, although this figure obviously varies between cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How to get even more benefits from <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts’- I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch)  has been reading this- ‘How loans within the <span class="highlight">family</span> can reduce tax’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While ever there are smart people, the rich business friends of the Government, who are prepared to dodge tax and the ordinary average <span class="highlight">family</span> income earner has to pay more and more tax because he cannot avoid taxation, because he pays pay-as-you-earn taxation, we will have to do something about this matter in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it can be argued that those- figures make no allowance for the changed arrangements in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances or health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one can do the sum again and include in the concept of net tax the amounts paid by the Government by way of child endowment or the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and the additional amounts that taxpayers have to pay now to be covered for health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sits oddly with the Government’s claim that it has done marvellous things for families by way of increasing <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the reality is that the decision originally to move to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances and abolish the tax rebate was a good move which we supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to commend the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Wilson)  for the proposals he has brought forward, which have been favourably received, in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> income splitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income splitting proposal of the honourable member for Sturt, this proposition involves taxing the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal depends largely on the acceptance of taxation of the <span class="highlight">family</span> unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A ‘<span class="highlight">family</span>’ means husband, wife, children and full time student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The flat rate of tax would be applied to the grossed up income derived by all members of a <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">family</span> would be taxed as one entity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this approach is to remove the necessity for income splitting and it would result in virtually all <span class="highlight">family</span> partnerships and trusts being taxed as if they were one income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the passage of time, and with the effect of inflation, the number of taxpayers with an income below $9,500 would diminish until virtually all taxpayers, on a <span class="highlight">family</span> unit basis, would receive about $9,500 and paying the flat rate of 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously every individual and every <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving over $9,500 would be advantaged by the 20 per cent flat rate, and any individual or <span class="highlight">family</span> receiving below $9,500 would be disadvantaged because the average, the flat rate, below $9,500 falls steadily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are working wives whose individual incomes are less than $9,500, but who, on a <span class="highlight">family</span> income basis, would benefit from a flat rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government brought in the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance as a great reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We concede that the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance scheme was a great reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not prepared to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When those tax scales in February 1978 were introduced their regressiveness, their unfairness to the <span class="highlight">family</span> income earners and the middle income earners, rapidly became apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most disturbing factor that strikes me from listening to the honourable member for Werriwa is this phoney concern he is now expressing for the <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member did that, and then he has come into this House and profess cynically and phonily that his concern is for the <span class="highlight">family</span> and for low tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance rates have been frozen since 1976 while prices have risen by 48 per cent; that a <span class="highlight">family</span> with four children is now $7 a week worse off than before the <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance was introduced; that the maternity allowance has been abolished; that <span class="highlight">family</span> allowance has been discontinued for students receiving the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance; that the TEAS allowance would have to be increased by something like $10 a week to provide the same spending power as it did in 1975; and that an extra $ 1 7 a week would be required to restore a <span class="highlight">family</span> on average weekly earnings to the living standard it enjoyed at the end of 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these few- from many- examples of the alarming erosion of <span class="highlight">family</span> living standards, combined with the abolition or watering down of many benefits, what incentives does the Minister offer to encourage the growth of families that he has espoused with such uncharacteristic vigour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sort of coldhearted indifference seeps through, whether it is in relation to <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances or in relation to the provision of adequate library facilities in this country for the people who belong to Australian families and who want to improve themselves or who want to relax in some sort of creative and satisfying way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make a few remarks on the question of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have received some 600 applications requesting <span class="highlight">family</span> reunification from the Timorese who came to Australia in the early days after the Indonesian takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because we are demonstrating in respect of <span class="highlight">family</span> reunions for Timorese people- as we did with, for example, the similar problems in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and also the Middle East- that we are prepared to do our utmost on the basis of humanitarianism to bring together families which are disunited by events over which they had absolutely no control such as war and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House recognising that- (1)1 in 5 unemployed <span class="highlight">family</span> heads in South Australia experience bankruptcy and repossession; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example of this is where, on the death of a person, a public appeal is made for members of the deceased’s <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other cases, the amount raised may be paid directly to the members of the deceased’s <span class="highlight">family</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is already clear that some will attempt to discredit the Government’s changed tax arrangements on <span class="highlight">family</span> trusts by emotional references to their effect upon the earnings of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer is saying that, by abolishing gift tax, what he has done is to make tax avoidance that much less complicated and costly by enabling the transfer of capital assets within a <span class="highlight">family</span> or to other persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this whole process the rights of the community, the rights of parents, the rights of <span class="highlight">family</span> and the places of students and children when they grow up all have to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suburban city seeks to maximise the advantages of low density <span class="highlight">family</span> style suburbs and the advantage of accessibility to all the services of the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A single income <span class="highlight">family</span> on an income below $15,000 a year is virtually excluded from the Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the case of a single income <span class="highlight">family</span> in a suburb in Sydney such as Auburn or Burwood, receiving a gross income of $10,000 and wishing to buy a very average home in that area for $45,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the <span class="highlight">family</span> saved 20 per cent of its income, it would take 1 5 years to save the required deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They did not have an extended <span class="highlight">family</span> to accommodate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be measured in terms of social costs imposed on the rest of the community, with things such as cramped accommodation, where two and three generations are forced to share accommodation which was designed, in a very cramped way, for one <span class="highlight">family</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In correspondence with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the only information I am able to obtain is that in order to receive coverage for the child under any form of benefit other than <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances the woman would have to resign her war widow’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there were a possibility that the location of the person who was holding that member of his <span class="highlight">family</span> hostage could be ascertained because a telephone call was expected to the home of the honourable member, as a subscriber, does he mean to tell me that he would not invite the police to listen to that phone call? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it possible as a first step to the indexing of <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances to implement a scheme to index <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances for families who are in receipt of one income on or below the average weekly earning or two incomes which together do not exceed that figure (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be possible to implement a scheme whereby indexed <span class="highlight">family</span> allowances would be payable to families where the families’ incomes were equivalent to or less than average weekly earnings, but administration would be complex and costly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a report in the  Northern Territory News  of 4 September 1979, claiming that ( a )  Mr Solomon  Nayilibity, employed for some years by Queensland Mines as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer, lived with his <span class="highlight">family</span> for about 6 months in a core shed belonging to the company, (b) the shed and a nearby tank containing radioactive samples were marked as radioactive, (c) the company has claimed that (i) unmineralised dust samples only were in the shed and were not dangerous and (ii)  Mr Nayilibity  did not mention any fears of radiation to a company spokesman who saw him during August 1979, (d) the company has not replied to  Mr Nayilibity  ‘s request for a medical test, (e) the test would be unlikely to disclose irradiation effects which might take decades to appear, (f) uranium samples were spilt from a split bag over a former company exploration camp site and registered more than the maximum 5000 microrems/hour on a counter, 85 times the safe public exposure limit and (g) Aborigines hunt and camp in the area but the company has no commission to re-enter the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first allegation was that  Mr Solomon  Nayilibitj, a local Aboriginal who is an employee of Queensland Mines, and his <span class="highlight">family</span> and other Aboriginals had some years ago lived for approximately 6 months in a core shed containing uranium bearing core samples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also informed that Queensland Mines Limited is prepared to arrange, upon request, for medicals for  Mr Nayilibitj,  his <span class="highlight">family</span> or any other member of the Nabarlek Aboriginal community who is concerned about radiation and at no cost to the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Applications for permanent residency from other sportsmen and women who have been here since 1975 would be considered on their individual merits, allowing for such factors as marriage to an Australian resident, <span class="highlight">family</span> disposition and ability to maintain themselves without recourse to dependence on social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-75">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many years’ disposable income was required by a single income <span class="highlight">family</span>, with a dependent spouse and 2 children, receiving average annual earnings to purchase (a) a medium priced block of land, ( b ) a newly erected 2 or 3 bedroom house or flat and (c) a medium priced established 2 or 3 bedroom house or flat in each capital city during each of the years from 1 970-7 1 to 1 978-79 and for the period1 July 1979 to 1 8 October 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-94">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware that the rate of unemployment, financial tragedy and <span class="highlight">family</span> depopulation has now reached alarming proportions throughout the sheep areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The special provisions in its television program standards relating to programming during <span class="highlight">family</span> and children’s viewing time between 4 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. daily are strictly enforced and all stations are familiar with their responsibilities under the Standards in programming at these times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>For obvious reasons the special provisions for <span class="highlight">family</span> and children’s viewing time do not prevent the presentation of news and other types of actuality programming of an informative nature during these periods: ‘A Current Affair’ is basically a live interview program, and as such is in this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-3">[More…]</a></li>
