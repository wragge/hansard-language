  <li>
    <p>Is this a form of civil conscription of the Australian people by members of the medical profession designed to impose upon the people a medical service that is not approved by their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister, as I have done previously, whether he would now nol agree that parliamentarians who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the affairs of the Australian people would command much greater respect and the confidence of those people if the whole of their income, including share holdings, were made available for public scrutiny - a practice which at present operates in many States throughout the United States of America and in Singapore under the Prime Minister,  Mr Lee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>three members of theteaching staff of the College <span class="highlight">elected</span> by that teaching staff; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he was expressing a personal opinion, does the Government believe that it is inviting further disunity in its ranks if he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter, is that we now have a new Prime Minister who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> strictly in accordance with the constitutional provisions of the Parliament and of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Could other honourable senators who were not fortunate enough to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the committees be assisted in a consideration of the Estimates by being supplied with the explanatory notes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as the Senate appreciates, these are all matters for determination in the light of priorities, which is what the Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know  Senator Prowse  will uphold the dignity of this chamber and the office to which he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and 1 fed sure that he will work very closely with you,  Mr President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our wish,  Sir, that  you shall be long spared to occupy the position to which you have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> today and that the Senate of this national Parliament will benefit considerably as a result of your elevation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Territory of Papua New Guinea security and intelligence service maintain surveillance of <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Territory House of Assembly and of members of the Mataungan Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A system of proportional representation implies multi-member constituencies, for example, taking the whole State as in the case of the Senate, or setting up regional type electorates within each State with a number of members <span class="highlight">elected</span> for each electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I objected he said that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> or selected members of the committee had priority to ask questions over all other honourable senators irrespective of the time that they may have waited at their seats at the table in order to ask questions of the Minister or of the public servants in attendance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case we are to have a Corporation which is not a body <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of the capability of its members to decide questions relating to wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be a body <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of its knowledge of the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the words ‘and until the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Representatives is summoned’, or words to that effect, should be inserted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2nd <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Because of the obvious necessity for the community to have clear knowledge of the Government’s policy, will the honourable gentleman clarify a statement by Prime Minister Whitlam that the Australian Labor Party federal authorities - the Executive and the Conference - can be expected not to alter policy on which the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, at least until after the next general election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the ludicrous situation that has been exposed again by the results of the Victorian State elections, where the Victorian Liberal Government had 46 members <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the State Parliament by 42 per cent of the vote, whereas 42 per cent of voters supporting the Australian Labor Party enabled that Party to obtain only 18 or 19 seats, will the Minister consider having a White Paper issued by the Commonwealth Electoral Office to point out the grave inequity of the Victorian Electoral distribution and so inform the people of Victoria and the rest of Australia of facts that the Australian Press has suppressed of a cynical, opportunistic, perversion of democratic electoral justice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first acts of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government was to establish the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the greatest tragedies is that a great nation like the United States of America has been able to move into other countries, particularly in South America, in order to create revolution, the destruction of human beings and the assassination of persons who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for what was said by  Senator Poyser,  it is a great tragedy that the leader of another country who was democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> has been overthrown by the military forces of his country and has taken his own life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this to have happened after a relatively short time would cause grave concern to everyone who hears that a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader has been overthrown by illegal military forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the present Government, when in opposition, assert that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Treasury benches it would promptly remove the existing 25 cents per gallon excise charge applicable to wine, and would not impose any alternative form of taxation on the wine industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Neruda  was not only one of the greatest poets of the century and the holder of the Nobel Prize for literature but also a diplomat in the service of the Chilean Government and a supporter of the previous democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of that country, will the Minister ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to make inquiries as to whether the allegation by the Chilean junta that he died of natural causes is in fact correct? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the reason for applying to the High Court to ensure that 6 senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Queensland at the next Senate election or to ensure that  Senator Gair  goes to Ireland as ambassador? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to people standing for elections who purport to represent a particular Party and who, upon being <span class="highlight">elected</span>, repudiate that Party and claim to represent some other Party, as National Alliance candidates in Western Australia have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first task of the Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 was to put air travel on a self-supporting basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring this matter to attention again, and I ask that, in keeping with the standard of competence and adherence to duty on the part of Ministers, these 3 matters be the subject of decisive statements in response to my request as representative of people whom I am <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am glad that  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack has become engrossed in the possibility of an Australian being <span class="highlight">elected</span>  president  of the General Assembly next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and constitutional rights, but is the States’ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign states formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources for their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As at 2 August 1974, the latest date for which comprehensive statistics are available, 4,252 retrenched persons had submitted applications for Income Maintenance and of this number 8 were proprietors of small enterprises who had <span class="highlight">elected</span> to be treated as employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his attention and his Party’s attention to Tasmania is preceding an early election, I suspect and I would expect that his pronouncements about Tasmanian transport would be something that he would fulfil or would try to fulfil if his Party were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I point out to the Senate- I think it is very relevant that I do so here this evening- that when we talk about the Queensland legislation we should remember that the Aboriginal councils in Queensland, <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Aboriginal people from all Aboriginal communities, looked at the Queensland legislation and told the Queensland Government the changes that they want in that piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are changing the Act in Queensland are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Aboriginal people who are affected by the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind  Senator Webster  that this chamber is a House of the people, not of the persons who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has had his successess because like other people, including myself, he has been able to get high enough on the Party ticket to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘Order of the day’, insert ‘ for the first sitting day in March 1975 to enable the Government to consult with the Aboriginal people living in the reserve communities in the State of Queensland and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils and other bodies and further to ascertain by poll taken within those communities the wishes of those people in relation to future restrictions upon the right of entry to those community areas’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this person is a government nominee and not a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Aboriginal people living on the reserve concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When the Allende Government, the properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of Chile, was overthrown the Australian Government recognised the new regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not prepared to show the slightest degree of interest in upholding the  Speaker  of the other place whom they <span class="highlight">elected</span> some 2 years ago and whom they so ignominiously dismissed- I suppose the expression is ‘summarily executed ‘-this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite incomprehensible that the Minister for Manufacturing Industry  (Senator James McCelland)  should suggest that an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of a State should not be trusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government intends to stand by the policy on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all I think he was the tenth <span class="highlight">elected</span> senator in South Australia and he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on Labor preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made  Mr Dunstan  Premier of South Australia and in return for that, I suppose, the Labor Party helped him to become the tenth <span class="highlight">elected</span> senator from South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Senate, as I have had to do on numerous occasions because of statements by  Senator Webster,  that during the 1970 election campaign I gave an undertaking to the electors of South Australia that if I were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate I would open an electorate office in Murray Bridge and continue to live in Murray Bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is an indication in this legislation that this Government intends to work in close and amicable co-operation with the people of the Northern Territory and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to give birth to Australia’s seventh State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does such loan carry with it any conditions disallowing expanded social welfare programs and benefits to the Australian community, such as have been laid down in the past to dictatorships such as Chile which received funds from the Fund after the coup which overthrew the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Allende Government on 11 September 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-51-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe in and support the view that the representatives who are sent to the Constitutional Convention ought to be representatives of the Parliament who are duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by both sides of the Parliament to represent our interests in what I believe could become a quite significant quorum and not representatives of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could have a situation in which a senator was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1974 for a six-year term, being number one on the ballot paper and was <span class="highlight">elected</span> again at the 1975 election for another sixyear term and at the end of the second six-year term had completed only seven years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bearing in mind the high importance of having a situation where the Parliament is able to function as a parliament so that we can do that which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do, to the best of our ability, I made very strong representations for increases in staff ceilings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am always annoyed when I hear Government senators severely criticising trade unionists for going on strike to get some justice, as the very same senators who are so vocal and critical of the trade union movement were quite happy to go on strike in the Parliament and hold up a duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, a government that had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice within three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout the period during which the budget is being framed it is expected that the Estimates Sub-Committee of the Council will keep in touch with the existing Budget Committee of the House of Assembly - a body made up wholly of <span class="highlight">elected</span> members - with a view to informing themselves of any points which members of the House may wish to have considered in the “draft estimates for the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Party on the other side of the chamber proposes that an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government in this country should not have the right to say to any individual: ‘We do not wish to hand you a licence to come into Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The central theme in the concept of the Vietnam Moratorium Committee, which consists of a self <span class="highlight">elected</span>, self selected and self directed group of people, is that if it thinks a law of the country is bad people are entitled to break it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what I believe identifies the <span class="highlight">elected</span> member with responsibility for asking a question with regard to public affairs and obtaining an answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONI am sure we all agree with  Senator Bishop’s  suggestion that this was a monstrous outrage, even against any person, lt is even more terrible when it happens to somebody who has been democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> to be a senator or to a person who has been democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> to any office in which he serves the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to inform the Senate that on 10th March, consequent on the resignation of the Right Honourable J. G.

    <p>I believe that any member of the national Parliament who really thought deeply about this subject and kept politics out of pensions would say that there is no doubt that we do not want a tribunal of outsiders telling us what this nation shall give as pensions, that the Parliament which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people lo govern should make the decision and should rise or fall by its triumphs or mistakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The developing practice of using industrial Trade Union organisations  to  effect purposes of a political character, not designed to or having the effect of improvingthe industrial conditions of the members of these organisations and not directly and immediately related to industrial issues but for the purpose of affecting political decisions, properly resting within the Constitutional power of the Commonwealth through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament and its instrumentalities and thus usurping the functions of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 can only urge upon the Senate that it ought not to adhere to a course which will involve the national Parliament, properly concerned with the consideration of national matters, in having to give some place in national priorities to what would be regarded as the legislation of the Australian Capital Territory, or to give the legislation of the Australian Capital Territory such pride of place that it would displace matters of national importance which are the primary concern of the persons who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another disability inherent in this scheme is that a government of a particular political persuasion may be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of a mandate which it receives from the public, based upon certain blandishments or offers of performance as a government; but, when it assumes office and begins to institute a policy on social services under which it agrees to offer benefits additional to those which are offered in New South Wales or Victoria, or wishes to give special consideration to education by providing some additional assistance, such as living away from home grants, special assistance in particular areas and things of that kind in respect of which it wants to exercise its own initiative, it cannot do that without incurring an adverse report from the Grants Commission and an adjustment Which takes away its right to institute that system which it wants to institute in the interests of the people of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a member to represent honey producers holds office for a period of 3 years commencing on the first day of July after the declaration of the poll at which he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot help feeling that this attitude has been due largely to the most unsatisfactory way in which the producer members of the Board have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> or appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The position as it exists and as it has existed since the Honey Board was set up over 9 years ago is that the producer representatives were nominated or selected by the State associations of honey producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change which is proposed is that the producer members of the Board - they do not represent exactly a majority of the Board but they are a dominant force on the Board because they are 5 members out of 10 - will be representatives of each State <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the honey producers in each State who are the owners of at least 200 hives of bees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The figure has been selected because it represents a person who would be making his living as a honey producer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not accept the argument that the provision that people can be both producers and packers and be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the producers to represent them, constitutes a handing over of the Board to packers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Statements I have received from the  President  of the Association,  Mr Kane,  and  Mr Archibald,  Secretary of the Association, show that they agree with the principle that producer members of the Board should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, it must be recognised that the time that is taken on this prevents the Senate giving time to national matters which really should be the preoccupation of persons who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  have previously paid a tribute to my fellow members, but as a result of the intercession of  Senator Gair,  I feel I ought to say that from the moment  I  was <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of that Committee, I received the greatest nonparty support and loyalty that any senator could hope for from any 7 other senators from different political parties with different outlooks on life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the event that there are inescapable reasons why the Senate should not continue to operate even in a nonlegislative role pending the calling of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Representatives, will you ascertain whether it is the will of the Senate that Parliament should be called as soon as practicable after the return of the writs for election to the House of Representatives so that the Senate committees can proceed with their processes of investigation and report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other point about Labor’s amendment which needs to be understood with crystal clarity is that in its last words it is intended rather circuitously to express the fact that whereas the Government wishes to provide an assured period programme of 5 years under the Bill, the Labor Party gives notice that if it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office it will terminate the benefits of this Bill, and it will not permit the grants to go on in any year after 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It came at a time when, after a succession of leaders who had the characteristics of having been bureaucrats and having had a feudal origin, the Japanese people, through the conferences of the Liberal Democratic Party, <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the first time a leader who is not a bureaucrat, who is not of feudal origin and who, although I understand he is now affluent, is essentially a man of the people -  Mr Tanaka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were all <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same franchise, as is the House of Representatives, by proportional representation which is undoubtedly a far more satisfactory method of determining the will of the electorate than the House of Representatives preferential system, but I realise that proportional representation for the House of Representatives would present more difficulties than it would solve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand, the legitimate right to criticise and seek to change the Government’s defence policy by democratic process: on the other, the illicit claim to perform acts designed to destroy defence measures undertaken by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, responsible to a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the ruling which you have made, what does the practice of the Senate permit to enable the representatives of the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place to ask questions, as is their right, when the Ministers have, refused when the Senate is not sitting to answer any questions until the Senate actually resumes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet tonight members of this Parliament who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people in their respective States are not prepared to defend the right to protection of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who has exposed many of the matters which were concealed by the last Government, and the Prime Minister of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most damning thing of all is that although we have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia, a combination of small groups can put up this sort of proposition and expect the Senate to approve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple reason is that the Attorney-General and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place by the people of Australia, had sought to set out to carry out his duty - the protection of life and limb in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this stage, I take the opportunity on behalf of myself and, I assume, all honourable senators to congratulate our esteemed colleague,  Senator McAuliffe  from Queensland, who I understand was <span class="highlight">elected</span> a life member of the Queensland Rugby League last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that at that time it was indicated that if a Labor Government were to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972 then a Bill providing for such improvements would be introduced this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make the point that the Democratic Labor Party, in taking the stand it did on this matter, was conscious of the stand that it has always taken in relation to the mandate given to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> to depart from that mandate and the Democratic Labor Party brought the Government back to the strict and honourable observance of the mandate, which has now been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also accepted that there was a mandate from the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> us to office to give effect to what we have proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the desire of the Government to protect and to preserve the individual rights of members of the Senate, including the 3 Independent senators  -  2 of whom have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Tasmania and the other by the people of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may be able to justify it on the basis of democracy or as related to the role of each honourable senator who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 10th October  Mr Ron  Davies sent a telegram saying that he was authorised by the Australian Labor Party to say that if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> it would require the Australian National Line to take over the vessel and to start immediately shipping operations to King Island which would carry a separate subsidy account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party, when <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, agreed to do something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we in the Senate are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same franchise as are the members of the House of Representatives and are voted for by many more people than vote for any individual member in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our opinions as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people should not be formed on the basis of whether persons, groups, organisations, law enforcement agencies or indeed members of Parliament might be brought into criticism, or worse, by an inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then the Australian Government which had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> only 4 months ago to carry out the will of the people, had to take time off from the important affairs of business to express in the House where a motion of this sort really mattered, a motion of confidence in a man who has done a great service to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In short, it is as though the worm had turned and found a voice, because it was not until a Labor government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and until  Senator Murphy  became the Attorney-General that 2,000 pages of documents were laid open to the Australian nation and to the Australian Parliament when he tabled them in the Senate  2i  weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the wording which  Senator Withers  used in relation to paragraph (5), which referred to the Prime Minister nominating one Government member as  Chairman  of the Committee, will show up correctly in Hansard because I think it was the view that the  Chairman  should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Committee itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was inherent in the proposal that the  Chairman  should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Committee from one of the members nominated, in effect, by the Government, but by inadvertence it was restricted to one of the members nominated by the Prime Minister, and the only members nominated by the Prime Minister would come from the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My early recollection was that the amendments moved by  Senator Withers  in respect of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and by  Senator Marriott  in respect of the Joint Committee on the Austraiian Capital Territory were an attempt by the Opposition, I thought, to take away from the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Government in the Senate the right to nominate the  Chairman  of each Committee and to provide that the  Chairman  should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the members of the Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purport of this provision is that the Committee elect a chairman who is one of those members who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Committee as a result of a nomination either by the Prime Minister or by the Leader of the Government in the Senate; in other words, he is a Government member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By agreeing to this motion we are falling in with the principle that in general the  chairman  should be able to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the committee from its members, whether they come from one House or the other, and we are also following the principle that the  chairman  should come from the Government members from either House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am very happy to participate in the debate and to support the remarks of the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  because on the last day of the previous Parliament the then Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Greenwood,  and myself each had a 7-minute burst about the merits of what his Government was proposing and what the Opposition, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Education that the establishment of a fourth university in Victoria has been contemplated for a number of years and that at the time of the Victorian State election in 1970 both major political parties - that is, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia - announced their intention to establish a fourth university, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted during the course of the last election campaign that the Prime Minister indicated that when a Labor government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it would be Government policy to implement the general principles embodied in the recommendations contained in the report dealing with the problems of mentally and physically handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to suggest that the Labor Party is committed to a firm policy on this matter, that it is seeking to ignore the expressed will of the people and that it is seeking to bring about a situation where there will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> a government that will not reflect the will of the people is quite contrary to the expressed views of the Leader of the Labor Party, of the platform of the Party and of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which found sufficient weight of evidence to make a unanimous recommendation to the Parliament in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tactic used on that occasion by the DLP was that if the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Australian Labor Party to government it would change the electoral system and would stay in power indefinitely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrasted to this, it has been claimed that the Tasmanian system is as near as possible to perfection, even with all its disabilities, inasmuch as the percentage of people who vote for the Labor Party, for example, is reflected in almost the same percentage of Labor members <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The federal executive then dismissed those who had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the ballot it had conducted and replaced them with those who were rejected, and  Senator Mulvihill  had the honour, if I might say that, of replacing me as the Assistant Secretary of the party in New <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite any faults which there might have been in our method of administration since we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government on 2 December last - I suppose it is only natural that there must be faults because we are mere mortals - this Government is getting on with the job of building a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the philosophy of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government does not lean that way at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Bill are to, (a) provide for 2 members of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of single member electorates, with effect from the first sitting of the twenty-ninth Parliament; (b) provide for full voting rights for both members for the Australian Capital Territory with all the powers, immunities and privileges held by other members of the House of Representatives; (c) divide the Australian Capital Territory into 2 single member electorates, of which one electorate shall embrace part of the Australian Capital Territory proper and the other electorate shall embrace the remaining part of the Australian Capital Territory plus the Jervis Bay territory - to be effective immediately following the expiry or dissolution of the Twenty-eighth Parliament; and (d) provide - (i) for the setting up of a distribution committee; (ii) for the inviting of suggestions and objections and preparation of a report to Parliament, along similar lines to that provided for the distribution of a State into electoral divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because a doubt does exist about the matter, the Government considers the wisest course is to defer the election of the additional member until the next general elections for the House of Representatives, particularly as separate legislation is being introduced to provide for 2 senators for the Australian Capital Territory to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> before that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of education, I saw a statement by one of the teacher organisations that it had been promised $ 1,434m by the Australian Labor Party last year if it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and that was only for certain aspects of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As members of the Parliament, honourable senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to try to present to the people what they consider to be the best possible changes that can be made through legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only after  Mr Carmichaels  union had extracted the promise from  Mr Whitlam  that the Australian Labor Party would abolish all the penal provisions from the present legislation if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office that it was prepared to, and in fact did, hand over $25,000 to the Labor Party for its election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely any person who claims to be a democrat will agree that union officials ought to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> only in properly supervised ballots, and that those ballots which are open to rigging ought to be properly supervised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the expressions of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Northern Territory but their wishes and desires are completely overridden and completely ignored by this Government’s action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that the Legislative Council is a body <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one were to carry that argument to its logical conclusion one would see that it would not be very long before someone would be suggesting that the other 60 senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a period of 3 years to tie in with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The person to whom I referred - I know this because I was on the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party in 1955 - was responsible for the destruction of the Labor Party and the Labor movement in Australia because he placed himself over and above the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people on that Executive and in other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been conceded that those who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber will not be senators in the sense of senators representing the States; the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives will not be affected; altogether, it is a good proposal and is in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was one of the youngest men ever to take on the onerous tasks associated with Labor Party officialdom, being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a post within the Victorian Branch of the Party in 1914 at the age of 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within 3 years of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1940, Arthur Calwell rose to the Ministry, acting as Minister for Information from 1 943 and also as Minister for Immigration from July 1945 until the defeat of the Government in December 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister to do so because a tape recording of his speech at Melbourne’s Festival Hall on 2 May 1972- the tape recording can be made available to him- reveals that he said that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> ‘we will not repeal or reduce any educational benefit which is already being paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office on 2 December, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Banard)  took office as a Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within 10 days of having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, even before a meeting of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party took place to elect the rest of the Labor Ministry, they took action to establish the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As soon as a report was received by the Minister for Education from the Committee which was appointed a mere 10 days after the Australian Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office because it regards education as a top priority it was, in pursuance of my Party’s policy of open government, tabled in the Australian Parliament for all and sundry to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proud of the fact that as soon as a Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Prime Minister took action immediately to correct the great imbalance that had occurred in our educational system as a result of the activities of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In plain words that was a promise and an undertaking to the people of Australia that if a Labor government were <span class="highlight">elected</span> the per capita grants, across the board, would be equally applied in perpetuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Government that the honourable thing for it to do would be to say that it will retain, as it promised in order to get <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the basic per capita grants which it insisted it would not deny any school if Labor became the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Executive, as a matter of policy decision on 14 October, authorised him to say that Labor government, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, immediately would instruct the Australian National Line to commission the ‘Straitsman’ and restore it to the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is one of the greatest indictments of the intelligence and sense of responsibility of people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament if they do not understand the true significance of what is being done when they destroy the last safeguard provided by capital punishment in the case of those unique crimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is in accordance with Labor Party policy as enunciated at the last election, when .the proposed national health scheme was one of the main planks on which the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President, the purpose of these amendments is perfectly clear: The principle of ‘one vote one value’ must be established as the fundamental objective of redistribution and our intentions were publicised before the last elections at which the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> an Australian Labor Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Long before I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate I said to South Australian senators: ‘Look, there is a nigger in the woodpile with Dartmouth, the way that Bolte has pulled the wool over Hall’s eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a lot of criticism today about our Caucus meeting last night but at least when decisions are made in that Caucus they are made by financial members, and <span class="highlight">elected</span> members, of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the interest in this aspect of Government policy by  Mr Hawke  and the Australian Council of Trade Unions suggest an area of disagreement between the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another debate  Senator McManus  referred to a meeting at Festival Hall in Melbourne at which, he alleged, the now Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  said that, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, they would continue the per capita grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the last election the Prime Minister told the Australian people that if a Labor Government were <span class="highlight">elected</span> he would give an immediate increase of $1.50 a week to pensioners and then would give an increase of $1.50 a week every spring and autumn until the pension rate reached at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the figures I have given, particularly those showing the improvement and increases in pensions that have flowed since the Labor Government took office in December last year, show conclusively that the promises made prior to the election have been completely honoured; and the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  shows, I believe, that prior to the election no undertaking was given by either the Prime Minister or the present Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  that a Labor Government, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, would continue the per capita grants to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the dairy farmers, especially those in electorates which have <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Labor Party members, should sit up and take notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am honoured to have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Labor Ministry by my colleagues of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and this Budget has the unqualified support of each and everyone of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the appropriate approach is to recognise what the Australian Labor Party said before it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government and what it highlighted in its election propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see how the Labor Party, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government on promises that it would not increase taxation and elaborate promises about the money it would hand out, in order to balance the Budget should increase the excise on cigarettes and petrol by 10 per cent and then claim that it is controlling inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was an economic recession in 1961 when at a general election they were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> with a mere majority of 240 votes in one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We seek the approval of the Parliament to allow the people of Australia to determine for themselves whether we, as the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the gravamen of their objection to this Bill is that they oppose the Australian people being given the opportunity to express, by referendum, their opinion, as to whether or not the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament of Australia should have constitutional power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister took over- quite rightly, because he is the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Prime Minister- being in charge of the arranging of the Constitutional Convention which had been mooted by State Premiers and the previous Government and which was held in Sydney early this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an extraordinary thing that the so-called democrats are now drunk with power on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most extraordinary to me that senators, when I talk to them about the various Bills and campaigns, say that the Senate is the <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, it is the States <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to their convenience and the convenience of this Parliament that they go back to the jobs we <span class="highlight">elected</span> them to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knows that it cannot get that power from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, so it uses the back door method of seeking a referendum in the hope that the people, who are very concerned about inflation and who have been sold this great pup that the be all and end all and the cure of inflation is for the Commonwealth to have power over prices, will carry the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it was reckless in the promises it made to the community to enable it to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present Government was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office the Democratic Labor Party wrote to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and recommended to him that he implement the provisions of the Bill introduced by the DLP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether that balance of power of 3 in the Labor Caucus necessarily illustrates that the Australian nation is getting what it hoped it would get when the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office- that is, the control of inflationary tendencies in the community, and at least control the ones which it has added in the period in which it has been in office- is another question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate election in the several States or at the same time as the next general election for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate election; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>provision will be made to further strengthen the democratic processes in relation to union elections by providing that all full-time federal officers in an organisation must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by direct election of the members of the organisation and that the only officers who can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the collegiate system shall be parttime officers of an organisation’s federal management committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we have an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government which, certainly in the view of the Opposition, has taken financial action against the interests of various sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One representative is <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the House of Representatives and one from the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a public meeting at which, incidentally, many of the residents of Darwin were present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable senator that any <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of the Northern Territory Legislative Council has a right to listen to arguments and advice of individuals, no matter which section of the community they are in, and to put that view to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I did not find in  Senator McLaren’s  speech, in which he was willing to advise the Senate, a statement that those <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council who are of the same political persuasion as  Senator McLaren  voted unanimously that the notice of acquisition should be objected to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the vote this evening will serve as a warning to the Government that the view of the people of a particular area should not be disregarded; that the opinion of the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative council of an area should not be completely disregarded; and that the opinion of this Senate, so recently expressed in opposition to the Government’s action, should not be treated in such a manner as it has been by the previous Minister for the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It lies empty because when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament I gave an undertaking that I would devote my full time to my duties as a member of the Parliament and live on the salary that the electors pay me to represent then- not like  Senator Webster,  who has outside interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was before the Senate the clearest evidence on which the Senate tonight could have made a definitive judgment, but it has <span class="highlight">elected</span> not to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In practice, union representatives on the jobs are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, most times with the confidence of the men on the job, because they see injustice in the factory which is never realised in a briefing in a legal office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the Senate derives its constitution and existence in the same way as the other House of Parliament insofar as it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of this country by vote? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the democratic process is to be observed, then a government which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a clear program which has been put to the people ought, in my view, to be entitled to have that program carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They take the privilege of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament and take with it the burdens that go with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is why senators were <span class="highlight">elected</span> and why they sought election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We think that this problem can be overcome if we get the establishment of the National Aboriginal Consultative Council to which 41 persons will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Aborigines themselves and that they, we hope, will achieve liaison between the people, the Department and the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It equally vests the control of those activities in the hands of people of that country through their freely <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those days the position was that Ernie Thornton could be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent the trade union movement of Australia at international conferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ernie Thornton was <span class="highlight">elected</span> General Secretary of the Ironworkers Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since my suitability as Chairman has been questioned, I point out that both the former Liberal-Country Party Government and the more recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government unanimously appointed me on my own merits to this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will not take his bat and ball and go home but will continue on the same basis as we have proceeded throughout the months since Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December last year, carrying out our policy which we undertook to carry out in our policy speech through the means of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly introducing something totally different from what has been proposed in the Bill which is something on which the Australian Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again this is a policy on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any proposition which was put forward by way of amendment or any other way which suggested that this responsibility did not exist and that there was just a general responsibility to students would be contrary to the policy on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>, contrary to the trust which the Australian people reposed in us and contrary to the interests of the Australian people who voted for this policy when they <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Government on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest, with respect to  Senator Rae,  that he has shown some sort of a suspicion that, despite what he is suggesting by way of amendment, the people who were appointed or <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Schools Commission, according to his program, would be in grave danger of being a warring body of representatives of pressure groups who would be constantly going back and feeling accountable to those pressure groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be an amendment understood to be adopted by the Opposition if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that I had a pretty unhappy experience as a member on the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House to the extent that I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that Committee in 1966; I sat at one meeting of the Committee which decided to ask all the parliamentary departments what accommodation space they required in the proposed house; and while those letters of inquiry went out to those departments we had an election, and my Party did not see fit to reappoint me to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we have to get some competent people and say to them: ‘Plan us a Parliament House on the designs and the ideas that have been put before us by the committee that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by both Houses of the Parliament for this purpose’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words we would not meet as 2 Houses meeting together; we would meet in what might be called a collegium of <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the Federal Parliament, as an electoral college, to determine this matter once and for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that if my form of words were adopted and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the national Parliament were to meet, as it were, in one great plebescite, in a collegium, in an assembly of <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons to determine this matter and the identity of the 2 Houses was submerged in the totality it would overcome even the most sensitive resistence of those who feel very strongly about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reminded people from the Liberal Party who came to speak to me that the Australian Capital Territory has not only an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member who is their representative in the Parliament but also another Minister whose sole responsibility is to look after the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill proposes that such senators will have the same powers, immunities and privileges as State senators and that both senators for each Territory will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a system of proportional representation at the time of each general election of members of the House of Representatives, provided that the first election of the Territory senators will be held at the time of the next election of State senators if such is held prior to a general election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the 60 State senators would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a period of 3 years instead of the present 6 years to tie in with elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now have other proposals based on other lines, which I will not debate now because they have yet to come before us, to interfere with the term for which senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the electors of South Australia but always I have been prepared to do something for the underdog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The people denying them that right are doing so because they are afraid of who might be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone with any common sense would know that under the present voting system one member from each Party would be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, its members on a provincial basis of electorates and we on a basis of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is inappropriate for senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Northern Territory at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he comes up for election in Victoria in the next 6 or 8 months he will have to find some 300,000 first preference votes before he is <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Poyser,  who tries to interrupt again, knows that in Victoria a candidate must have 300,000 first preference votes before he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  referred to the number of primary votes that were received by  Senator Poyser  and myself when we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place, but numbers do not always have a monopoly on ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us should meet as a college, as an assembly of <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to the Federal Parliament, irrespective of and divorced from our membership of either House, to decide by resolution at that common convocation where in our opinion, should be the site of the national Parliament so assembled in assembly- on Camp Hill, Capital Hill or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it will not bring the 2 Houses into any type of traditional or emotional conflict because members will be meeting as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people and not as members of the Senate or members of the House of Representatives respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this type of assembly divorced from the presence of both Houses as such, or members and senators as such, but as representatives of the people in the federal Parliament to determine what would be the site of the House that represents the political hopes, desires and aspirations of the people, would meet the wishes of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne’s own words are that we attend as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people by the very fact that the people voted us into a House of the Parliament, and my plea is that we uphold the dignity of that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people that is a duty that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He, in collusion with some of his doubtful quantity colleagues, has endeavoured to turn the Senate chamber into a circus on more than one occasion since the present Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is purely a transitional arrangement designed to adjust to the new system the terms of those existing senators whose terms expire on 30 June 1977 and the terms of those who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the forthcoming Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, a senator <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the forthcoming Senate elections for service from 1 July 1974 will have a term running until the 1981 House of Representatives election- again unless there is a double dissolution or earlier election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean, in normal circumstances and, of course, excluding any senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> to fill casual vacancies, that the senators serving when the constitutional alteration becomes law could have a term of up to about seven and a half years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should add that when a double dissolution occurs under the new arrangement, the senators then <span class="highlight">elected</span> will be divided by the Senate into 2 classes as at present, but their terms will be equal to 2 House of Representatives terms in the one case and one House of Representatives term in the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister also said that the Government would want to include a provision that the State Houses of Parliament be <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in those States with upper Houses <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people very large inequalities exist as the following examples show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales upper House is <span class="highlight">elected</span> not by the people but by the existing members of the 2 Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also proposes an amendment of the Constitution so that each House of each State Parliament will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the amendment will require New South Wales to alter the voting system for its Legislative Council so that all of its members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the ordinary voters of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government should have both a voice and a vote in the loan council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other was that the Australian Government be empowered to borrow on behalf of <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is to grant financial assistance only to <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are not rights to be taken away by those who would petulantly threaten to take their bat and ball home if they are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> captain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I pointed out earlier, the specific purpose of clause 16 of the Bill is to enable the setting up of boards in the various States and Territories in order to put all these views before the Commission which may, if it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis that we suggest, not have people representing various groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The government is a government which has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a democratic election and it is entitled to make such decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that there is nothing dogmatic, doctrinaire or authoritarian about a Government which has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people exercising its power by appointing a Commission as important as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we take them one by one we find that the principle, rather than the exception, is that they represent specific interests and in many cases representatives of groups are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, in the whole of the sphere of primary industry we will find board after board on which there are representatives of special, conflicting groups who are frequently <span class="highlight">elected</span> to such boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the wheat growers are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to an Australian Wheat Board or in the case of a state milk board there are the producers’ representatives and the consumers’ representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first acts of the Labor Governmentwithin 9 days of having been <span class="highlight">elected</span>- was to appoint the Interim Schools Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No government which has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to carry out a legislative program should be confronted by an Opposition which has not gone to that election but which happens to have a majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to the House of Representatives; and they would also have representation in this House, if the Opposition had not blocked our legislation, which would have provided for this in accordance with the Australian Labor Party platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that the time has come when I, as the first Aboriginal to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a parliamentarian, should make my thoughts known in this Parliament where decisions are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is public knowledge, I think, that the people who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to these various districts will not be sitting down in big flash offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the Senate is attracting unfavourable publicity- and I think there is every entitlement for the public and the Press to comment on the Senate- is obstruction which the Opposition is giving to the carriage of measures which are part of the platform and policy upon which the Government of Australia was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives for the Division of Corio in the by-election in 1940 and he became Minister for War Organisation of Industry in 1941, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction in 1945 and Minister for Defence in 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time in the history of Australia, the Aboriginal people of this country are to be consulted, through a committee <span class="highlight">elected</span> by them, on what should be done in matters relating to Aborigines so that they, directly through this Committee, can advise the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament on what they, as the people best able to judge, believe to be the interests of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that I am dealing with the subject of arbitrary power, let me mention some of the changes that have been made to the uses of excessive and arbitrary power by this Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of the election campaign the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made it quite clear that we would take action in this area if we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tariff Board was established in 1921 and it has been an important and respected source of advice to 2 1 of the 28 Parliaments which have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> since federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill is passed in its present form, it will be mandatory on the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government to go to a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> statutory authority for advice and recommendations before it can make decisions on industry assistance policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we will find that a commission not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, and therefore not answerable to them, will virtually be the decision maker in an enormously wide range of economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It underlines the ignorance of the consultation and negotiation system and even questions the democratic right of Australians to express their point of view to the Government they have <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general attitude of the Opposition is that when a government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office and presents its Budget, the Opposition will not oppose or vary areas of expenditure contained in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been said previously by the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy),  in reply to a question, that the Senate is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same basis as members of the House of Representatives are <span class="highlight">elected</span>- by the people of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will know that an important program we have embarked upon is the creation of nationally <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second point I wish to make about the constitution of the Senate is that honourable senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a term of 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States have a separate interest to be protected with respect to constitutional change, and it is up to the Senate, composed of senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a State-wide franchise, to ensure that the State interest is protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Prime Minister did not give such a bonus last year on the ground that the Government was newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> and time was too short. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first acts of the Labor Government when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> was that of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in his capacity as Acting Minister for Education, to appoint an Interim Schools Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did not members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party say when the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office that they would not be obstreperous and that they would see that the legislation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our policy speech we said that if we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government we would establish a Schools Commission along the same lines that the previous Government laid down for a Universities Commission and an Advanced Education Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So on 26 September 1972, 2 months before the Federal election in which the Australian Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, a motion was passed in those terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here in the record of the Parliament 2 months before this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office is his statement that we would continue those grants in 1973 but not thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, surely, really outlines the difference in philosophy between us on the Government side- those of us who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by popular vote to implement the policy that the Prime Minister espoused at the last electionand them, the collective Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It being the end of 1973 we want to implement the policy on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now the Opposition seeks to amend the political ideology upon which the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Drake-Brockman has admitted that within 10 days of the Australian Labor Party being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office the Prime Minister established the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 13 April this year, about 4 months after this Government had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, my colleague the Minister for Education,  Mr Beazley,  wrote to Professor Karmel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the policy on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> and it is in conformity with the platform of the Labor movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we ask is that the Government carry out the promise made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Education,  Mr Beazley,  before the election, namely, that if the Labor Party were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office it would at least maintain the basic per capita grants given to every school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, just as the members of the House of Representatives were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It appears to me however that members of the Opposition complain bitterly when any trade union leader, including the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,  Mr Bob  Hawke, appears on television to express the point of view of the industrial organisation by which he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it exempted contraceptives from sales tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It certainly was never intended that the Senate be used to obstruct the legislative program of a recently popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was referring to the Senate which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1967- the Government will not have a majority in its own right, though it was, little more than a year ago, given by popular vote, a very large majority in the House of Representatives; a majority which, in the normal course, it will continue to have for the better part of the next 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the flush of victory and following the terms of the GovernorGeneral ‘s speech the Government acted in order to bring about the radical change in our society which the Austraiian people sought when they <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Government just over a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Caucus can make this change in this democratic way, there is no reason why this Senate, which is duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of this country- by the same people who vote for the other House- cannot, in the same democratic way as Caucus, change the decision of the Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to recognise that the people who are opposing are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by voters just as honourable senators on the Government side are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate, as its members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent States, has a much wider sphere of activity and thinking because each State comprises so many aspects whereas individual electorates can have a very small area of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that as senators we have to take a much wider view of things because of the very basis on which we are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, that is, by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In effect, it means that a corporation which is selected by the Commonwealth and the States will have the say over what goes on in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This means that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representation aspect of this sort of development will be ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I, as the representative of the Government, need to say is that my colleagues join me in appreciating that the Australian people will now not be deprived of the Australian Schools Commission which, prior to the last Federal election, the Labor movement undertook to establish if and when we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was suggested that the proposal does not have the support of those responsible <span class="highlight">elected</span> sections of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I did not think I would live to see the day when among the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, one of those charged with implementing democracy in this country, let alone a man in the highest office of the land, the Senate of this Parliament- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party went to the people at the last election with the clear policy that it would, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, establish a National Health Insurance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government as soon as the present Government is prepared to hold an election, which it is showing a marked reluctance to do- it is making big noises but taking little action- we will immediately re-introduce the base per capita grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last election the Australian Labor Party had spoken of the proposed Corporation having its grower representation <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party also would have wished that the members of the Corporation be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and not appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All those grower representatives were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of this provision is to ignore the <span class="highlight">elected</span> industry body of Tasmania which is the State Fruit Board and which, up to this time, has had the direct and acknowledged right to nominate the 3 Tasmanian members of the Apple and Pear Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows from the policies that were established by the Labor Party before it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2 December of last year and which it has carried out since its election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it has taken certain major steps to see that we in Australia have sensible, logical and amicable relations with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position in the U.S.A. at the present time is that a VicePresident, <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a policy of law and order, now has not only lost his Vice-Presidency but has been disbarred from legal practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I once heard a member of the Australian Labor Party say that if the Australian Labor Party were ever <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office it would fix up the postal service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his policy speech the Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  pledged that the Australian Labor Party would not reduce the defences of Australia if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government promised, before being <span class="highlight">elected</span>, that it would not reduce the size of the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it was a piece of unparalleled presumption that the Government should put forward proposals to alter the method by which members of the State Houses of Parliament should be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until these propositions are passed by this House of the Parliament, in which the people are now at this moment expressing their point of view through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives who are in the majority, Government senators cannot complain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will accept here the will of the people expressed by the majority vote of this chamber by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevant Bills were passed by the chamber which the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> at that election but were thrown out by this chamber in a contemptuous fashion on 4 December without even being given an second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here is a government, <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia, which is in a minority position in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said during the debate on these Bills, both last night and today, that the Senate’s role is to be a supervisory role over the Government and that the Opposition in this place is not adopting an obstructionist attitude towards the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they want to adopt one policy for an election of the House of Representatives and another policy for an election to the Senate, or do they want an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government to be supervised by a Senate, or half of a Senate, that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> 3 years earlier, not on the issues that were current at the time the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have the elections divided they can say anything they like because when they are asking for senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> they know that they have no responsibility for government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple facts are that the political parties go to the people with a program for which they want to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The party <span class="highlight">elected</span> usually implements that program in a period of 3 years, the normal life of a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Cant  asked him rhetorically: ‘Are you suggesting that when the 2 houses were <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time we had weak government’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An honourable senator is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for his term or until a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, but the senator’s term is reduced independently of his election and independently of what ever period for which the people may have <span class="highlight">elected</span> him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that I was originally <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of life is that when a double dissolution occurred in 1951 various senators, including  Senator Marriott  who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1949 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Well, Senator Wright was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1 949 and he had a 6-year term but had to face the people in 195 1 after 2 years of his 6-year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> very nearly at the top of the ticket and he had a full term to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just pointed out that 6-year terms were reduced to about that period when  Senator Wright  and I were first <span class="highlight">elected</span> but we could not complain about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present system anybody who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate is not able to take his seat until the following July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A public servant or person who holds an office of profit under the Crown has to resign from his job when he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate at a democratic election do not take their seats until the following July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 say now that the Queen would have had no compunction at all in repeating the things which the Prime Minister put to the people and on which the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when the fourth change of name takes place that will be a change every 5 years, which is not even the full term of an honourable senator who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will allow the members <span class="highlight">elected</span> by electors of this country to decide who will be in the Ministry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party will not allow the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this Parliament to choose the Cabinet as we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes we are criticised and some people say that some of the Ministers we have <span class="highlight">elected</span> are not capable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least those Ministers have the confidence and the majority support of the 93 <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Party members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This change of policy has been brought about because the Liberal Party is not happy with the choice of its shadow cabinet <span class="highlight">elected</span> by its parliamentary members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time in the history of government in Australia, when this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it made the pension increase payment retrospective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We made the promise that we would increase pensions if we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I found in the area where I live that Liberal Party candidates and members of the Liberal Party were going around, before the legislation came in, a week after we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>- and they knew full well that they were telling mistruths to the people- saying: ‘Oh yes, the Government promised you an immediate increase but it is not going to give it to you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the first the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Australian Labor Party, made a clear promise that, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, he would reduce inflation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the promise by the Labor Party that if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power it would in a short time bring to the Aboriginal people of Australia a new deal, giving them a chance for dignity, good housing, good education and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happened when the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and it abused every American, British and French politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A main theme of the Labor Party’s policy speech was that a Labor government, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, would look towards control of foreign investment and a plan to achieve Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the first and only, to date, <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal member of Parliament, I seek the indulgence of the Senate for I feel compelled at this point in time, because of what is happening to my race with threats of violence and the inevitable backlash which will take place, to refer today to 3 sections of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being a democrat I always had thought that these decisions were to be taken by the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government but apparently that is a thought which does not commend itself to honourable gentlemen opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He laid down very firmly that if he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as Prime Minister he would reduce inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statements made by the Prime Minister and various members of the Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern this country, the Prime Minister at least must have lost all credibility so far as the Australian electors are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe this present Government should learn to live with the fact that it must be responsive to the will of a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Constitution the term of service of a senator who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> at such an election cannot begin until the first day of July of the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view that occurs on the day on which the returning officer declares the person <span class="highlight">elected</span> and returns the writs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not prepared to hear argument from those who were democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to represent them here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that every senator was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to help carry out the Senate’s function of review and protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other houses were nominated, others were appointed and others were <span class="highlight">elected</span> from a restricted franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Senate ever since its inception has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people upon adult franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying, if I could maintain a simplicity in my presentation, that one of the unique features of the Senate was that it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by adult franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, the Australian Labor Party, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power in 1972, were to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power a second time in 1 975 and there were to be a half Senate election on the occasion of each election one would imagine that the Senate, at the end of the 1 975 election, would represent the view of the Labor Party as expressed at each election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again, I believe, is a tendency likely to flow from a constitutional requirement that the 2 Houses should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the one time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has occurred when the Senate and the House of Representatives were <span class="highlight">elected</span> at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it is fortunate for the workings of democracy that now they are able to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a different time, because the role of the Senate which I have just mentioned as an independent body reviewing legislation is aided by that fact- and notwithstanding that it is seen by some as an annoyance and an inconvenience, the way the Senate is functioning is part of democracy and it aids the democratic processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because if it must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as the House of Representatives, the tendency- and I put it no higher than that; but in politics that tendency is so often borne out- will be for the Senate to be a replica of the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet they talk about us as if somehow or other we are running the Senate, whereas every educated child in the community knows that there is a temporary defect in democracy in the community in that the Government, <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, is being frustrated in its will by those senators opposite who are yelping out and not letting me speak freely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, the  Deputy President  himself was <span class="highlight">elected</span> only a week or so ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The nominee of the Opposition parties was <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Deputy President  in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any man who votes against allowing the people to vote on the proposition which the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government wishes to put to them can hardly claim to be a democrat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government has its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government undertook to the people at the last election that it would put this proposal to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It strikes a responsive chord with me because I remember that before the Labor Party became the Government  Mr Whitlan  promised that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Party would reduce interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has arisen because a Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people with a Prime Minister, a leader, who has consistently advocated that this should be the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government should have both a voice and a vote in the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other was that the Australian Government be empowered to borrow on behalf of <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, and particularly if the seven heads of government cannot agree, the Australian Parliament could sponsor a referendum to insert the words ‘or <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies’ after the word States’ wherever that word occurs in section 105A of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The Commonwealth may make agreements with the State and with <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an Australian Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people wishes to put a proposition to the people to vote to change their Constitution, will any person in this Parliament deny the right of the Australian Government to go to its own people and say: ‘We ask you to change your own Constitution and we want you to vote in a free and regular election on whether you choose to change your own Constitution’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will go out and we will ask the Australian people to vote against them because we do not agree with them, but never would we deny the right of a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to go to its own people and say ‘We, the Government of Australia, ask you to vote to change your Constitution in such and such a manner’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, the over-reaching of a temporary majority in this place which dares to intervene between the Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people and the people themselves when the Government simply desires to seek their vote on whether they would change their own Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the more honourable senators of the Opposition put forward this view the sooner the people of Australia will realise that the Government that they <span class="highlight">elected</span> is going to carry out its program, that it is going to put its propositions to the people and that it will not be deterred in any way by the manoeuvring, the rationalisations and the shabby tricks that are put up by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always understood that one was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate to work in the Senate, that one’s first duty was to work in the Senate and that if one had time over from one’s work in the Senate one could indulge in ministerial office, Senate committee work, parliamentary Party work, parliamentary Party committee work, Party organisation work in the electorate, etc., but that one’s first and foremost duty was to work in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the recent elections in Great Britain a government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with about 37 per cent of the total community vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a great deal in this Bill about Parliament being <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people, with a vote being guaranteed for everybody over the age of 18 years, including Australian citizens who have had a reasonable period of residence in an electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, what the Constitution says is that there must be, as it were, a primary scrutiny of proposed referenda proposals by the legislatureby the <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December 1 972 the Australian public <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-To answer the last portion of the honourable senator’s question first, I point out that the Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a period of 3 years and therefore has that period in which to effect the mandate given to it by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No democrat can object to a procedure whereby the people will make the decision if a conflict exists between 2 Houses equally entitled to claim that they are democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the present Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> we have actually seen this policy implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was rather ironical that I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives and still remained a member of the same council, as did Lin Riches, and that we combined our efforts to attract this industry to the Port Augusta-Redcliffs area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the  President  of the Senate can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> only by a majority vote of the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has shown that it is not a government that cares about principles, it is not a government that cares about honesty, it is not a government that cares about people, it is not even a government that cares about the country it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, on a fairly simple matter such as how many senators will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each State at the forthcoming Senate election, the number varies from day to day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What it ought to do is to say that there will be 5 senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Queensland, and go on from there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one can accurately predict the result if 5 or 6 senators are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Queensland because the people themselves will vote on that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a person has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> or appointed, as he can be by a GovernorinCouncil in any of the States- he can be appointed; he does not have to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>- if any one of the provisions of sections 44 or 45 of the Constitution are contravened, the Senate can meet and determine whether any action should be taken against the person who is sitting as a senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make no defence of the Government’s position in this matter because I believe that the immorality in the matters that we have been determining over the last several months lies not so much in the appointment of the Honourable Vincent Gair but in those 10 senators who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1967 and who have sought to sit in judgment upon a government that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the last 18 months since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1 972 it has sought to implement the mandate that was given to it by the Australian people but these 10 senators have been sitting in judgment and have been attempting to nullify and to destroy the mandate that was given to the Government by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Normally 5 senators from each State come up for election, but in this case it would have meant that 6 senators would have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad that we all agree that the Australian Capital Territory has come of age to the point that we are treating it in a somewhat similar way to that applicable to the States and giving the people in the Territory 2 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the House of Representatives after the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)  in his statement talks about a requirement of urgency but I would not have thought that we would have reached that stage because the Labor Party said, through its leader, now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  that if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, it would bring this legislation in as a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that scheme is as bad as  Senator Little  tries to make us believe it is, it is a wonder that when there has been a change of government in the United Kingdom- there have been many changes of government over the last 30 yearsthe Conservatives, as one of their first actions when <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government, did not change the national health scheme to some system that they support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the remarks that they have tendered in the Senate today one would gain the impression that if by some mischance at some future election they were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> to government they would continue with the hopeless, maladministered ramshackle scheme that the Australian people have had to put up with for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he take note that the Australian Labor Party in that upper House of fat succeeded in forcing the lower House, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, to an election and that in that election the people overwhelmingly endorsed the action taken to deny supply in the upper House by giving the Labor Party an immense majority which enabled it to become the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle upon which these complainants act comes from Great Britain, and it was based on the fact that the House of Lords was not an elective House and that therefore it should not thwart.the will of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That tradition was brought to Australia because in most, if not all, cases the Upper Houses were Houses of property and again it was contended that the Houses of property should not thwart the will of the fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before being <span class="highlight">elected</span> the member for Adelaide he had been Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of the Building Workers’ Industrial Union of South Australia in the years 1950-52 and then organiser of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plethora  of  commissions, boards and so on that has grown up under the Labor Government raises the question of just who is governing this country- the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament or the many and varied extraneous bodies that are each staffed with a couple of Australian Labor Party stalwarts just to ensure that the decisions reached are in the Australian Labor Party’s interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to examine further this amendment that has been proffered today, apart from comparing it with the one moved only last March which was completely rejected by the Australian people in May this year, let us go to the amendment moved in March 1973, 4 months after this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to their sense of realism and their sense of responsibility, not just as senators but as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian people to reject this amendment forthwith and turn to much more important matters of state, including the normal discussion of the Address-in-Reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the election on 1 8 May we <span class="highlight">elected</span> 60 senators and 127 members of the other House, a total of 187, and the last position to be filled, the 187th, is the one which I have the honour to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this having been said, we want to arrive at the conclusion that the Senate now is no longer what was sneered at by  Mr Whitlam  for a few months before June as a Senate <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am prompted to take part in this debate this evening because the Opposition has <span class="highlight">elected</span> again on this occasion to move an amendment to the Address-in-Reply that has been proposed by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that honourable senators opposite would not want me to have a heresy hunt or to start investigating the events of yesterday when that gentleman was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Presidency not with the support of the Independent members in this chamber but with the support of a Liberal or Country Party Opposition senator who defected, and who defected at a time when the Leader of the Opposition in the other place was endeavouring to castigate the Government for not having complete control over its members or being able to discipline the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it the policy of the Australian Government to allow trade unionists, who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, to intrude into such sensitive diplomatic areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a byelection adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more just to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory, thus allowing the representation of the parties to be more evenly balanced than would be the case if only one senator for each Territory were provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill, after the first election of Territory senators, both senators for each Territory will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time there is a general election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the result, we must suppose, of a Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the assertion that it knew best how to deal with the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, as I have said, it is somewhat ironic that I, having been involved in the particular spin-off of that political infighting, have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to an upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point because of the large number of new senators who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber and also because of the number of what I would call ‘old senators’ who have not had a great deal of experience in this place in terms of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the comments of  Senator Drake-Brockman  concerning one newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senator, I believe that the contributions of those who have made their maiden speeches have been of as high a standard as we have seen in this Senate for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amongst the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators we heard speak today was  Senator Steele  Hall from South Australia, who has just been denigrated by  Senator Jessop,  who just sat down, as one of his political opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, he complains that this Parliament is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by people, not acres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of the population in the city areas and are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of acres in country areas one can only draw the conclusion that he is objecting to the number of Liberal members in the coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill, far from improving the electoral process and far from improving the fairness of that process, is more than likely going to create an element of unfairness which has never before characterised the electoral system under which members of the House of Representatives have been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second matter which is suggested is whether the number of senators proposed to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each Territory is appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third matter which the committee could examine is whether senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent a Territory should be restricted to voting only on matters affecting that Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not have <span class="highlight">elected</span> assemblies with authority conferred by the Commonwealth Constitution and they do not have legislation of the Imperial Parliament, as the States have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has also proposed in its amendment that the right to vote of any senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the electors in the Territories should be restricted to matters affecting the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition would not allow the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this chamber to deliberate on all matters it could not very well allow the honourable member for the Northern Territory in the other place to deliberate on the matters which come into this chamber and on which the Opposition has been quite prepared to deliberate- in fact, which it has been quite prepared to throw out on many occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As reported at page 2525 of the Senate Hansard of 7 June the Leader of the Australian Country Party in the Senate  (Senator DrakeBrockman),  as he was then although I understand that he is now the Leader of the National Alliance, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> as such at the recent election, said at the conclusion of his speech: Therefore we in the Country Party oppose this legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that despite the fact that the member of the Country Party who represents the electorate of the Northern Territory in the other place has gone on record time and again and claimed credit for being <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the promise that he would fight for senatorial representation for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on each occasion on the platform that he will fight for Senate representation for the Northern Territory but when such a proposal has been put forward in this chamber the members of his Party in this place have deserted him and voted the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Committee has been in the Northern Territory and has been questioning witnesses on the subject of the giving to the people of the Northern Territory of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative council I have asked every witness I have questioned what their impressions or desires were about Senate representation and with only about 2 exceptions they have all agreed that they have been disenfranchised by not having Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it would not be fair to the Country Party for the Australian Capital Territory to have Senate representation because it would not be able to get a member of its Party <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, but it would be able to get one <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a senator for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that there is any doubt that Archbishop Makarios is still the constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span>  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no move to increase the powers of the Legislative Council, which is the locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> body of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the number of Senators proposed to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each Territory is appropriate; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clearly the Opposition parties in this place have earned the rebuke given by one of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators and certain individual members of the Opposition who said that there should be a more workmanlike approach from the Opposition parties to their parliamentary responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the second occasion on which the Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would hope that the Opposition would give the Government some opportunity to implement the policies on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern this country for the next 3 years and would give the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory representation in this chamber on the same basis as they are represented in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder what  Senator Steele  Hall’s attitude would be if the present Bill made provision for 10 senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It might suggest that 2 senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Territory of Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might suggest that a number of senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from Cocos Island, because that is a territory that requires representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Steele  Hall should read the Constitution as it relates to the House to which he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 128 of the Constitution should be impressive to the man who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Senate and who is a former Premier of an important State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact, as may appeal to  Senator Steele  Hall, that if this Bill goes through and that then at the next Senate election 2 senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Northern Territory there will be only one member of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now the Government seeks to have <span class="highlight">elected</span> 2 senators from the Northern Territory and two from the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only members of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory which was set up by this present Government to advocate how it should act for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council know that the Labor Party has stepped in over that Committee and has now sent  Dr Paterson  to say: ‘We will decide the terms of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council in the Northern Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be most interesting to see whether the great Labor principle of one vote one value and Aboriginal representation in that great area of the Northern Territory will be shown up by the present Labor Government’s declaration of what it wants in a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes that the extra senators would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a Senate election in 2 years time and would contest their election at the next House of Representatives election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would enable these senators, if they are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no, under the proposals of the Labor Party, the senators will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 2 years time, they will come up for election in another year and they will come up for election in another 2 years after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has proposed that 2 senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at their first election at the next Senate election, and thereafter as each House of Representatives election occurs two of them shall come out and stand for reelection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, is it not a fact that in this Bill there is the fundamental principle that the representatives shall always, by law of this Parliament, be twinned with the Senate, that is, that the territorial Senate representatives shall always compulsorily be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-They made up their minds and they re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> the Government which had obtained a double dissolution in respect of 6 Bills, one of which we are now debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say now to the Opposition that it is the wish of the Government, which has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to govern this country, that this measure be dealt with and that the Senate determine whether it will pass it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please, senators, did not everybody hear the Leader of the Opposition,  Senator Withers,  say last year that the Opposition has embarked on a deliberate course of bringing down the Government that had just been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the majority of the Australian voters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have consistently maintained that view and it would be unreal, having regard to the mandate upon which each one of us was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on this side of the chamber, to change a view which we previously have held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is because that was the basis upon which we campaigned and that was the basis upon which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we go back to the original questions which we asked ourselves when this scheme was promised to us long before this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, we have to ask: Who would pay for the scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why do not honourable senators opposite face realities and realise that for the second time in less than 2 years the Labor Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and pass these Bills? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not mind putting up with a logical sort of argument but the honourable senator has not looked at a hospital in Queensland since the Country Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office because that is when they disappeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have our right by virtue of election to have our say and to be heard, and it would be quite improper for the Senate to demand that these Bills be put through- guillotined through as happened in another place- without new members democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> having their say, being heard, and expressing their points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-In resuming the debate on the second reading of the Northern Territory (Administration) Bill 1974 I remind the Senate that we are deciding now in this place whether the people of the Northern Territory will be given a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly on or about 24 October this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be a Parliament- which surely must have powers- to which 5 Ministers will be appointed who, with the Administrator- who is like a governor- will act only in an advisory capacity, how can the Parliament legislate, administer and rule the people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that was said on behalf of the Australian Labor Party during the 1972 election campaign was that if the ALP were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, as it was, there would be self-government for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other aspect of the Bill with which I want to deal is that it makes provision for a continuity of administration in between the time of the cessation of the term of office of the official members and the present <span class="highlight">elected</span> members until the new Parliament is drawn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the Legislative Council,  Mr Tony  Greatorex, has still to be told how the Territory’s proposed Legislative Assembly will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member-   in the council yesterday that he was still waiting for the information from the Minister for the Northern Territory,  Dr Rex  Patterson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Officers of Australian Government departments with great consistency gave evidence- we were assured in most cases that their Ministers had seen their submissions- advocating an <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Assembly for the Territory, adding with emphasis, ‘But we should not give any of our powers away. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my belief it is absolutely essential to decide upon the number of Aboriginal representatives, the means by which they are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and from what areas they are to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are, as I see them, that  the  election is to be held on  24  October, the reason mainly being because the Minister took as fact that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members would resign if there was not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly by the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those threats were made publicly and to the Committee by a number but not all of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were sincere in their desire to force the Government into action because they believed that they should not go on holding office for a longer period than that for which they had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Houses of this Parliament at the behest of the Government set up the Committee with the one proviso that we inquire into and report on means by which there shall be appointed or <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we members of the Committee should theoretically close our eyes to the fact that this legislation has become law, that there will be an election and that there will be an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all aware that the purpose of this Bill is to give legislative force to the establishment of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are seeing history being written in that one of the territories of Australia is to be given a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of some type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory I was quite proud of the fact the present Labor Government had capitalised on the pronouncements made by the former Liberal and Country Party Administration that a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly would govern the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government set up a Joint Committee composed of members from both sides of the Senate and the House of Representatives, in part to report to the Government on what would be the wise way to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember well the strong arguments that were put by one group, the Aborigines in the Northern Territory, that here was an opportunity to give those wonderful citizens of Australia, concentrated in greater numbers in this part of Australia than anywhere else, direct <span class="highlight">elected</span> responsibility on the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council unanimously favour a Legislative Assembly of 19 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is certain that on the promise of the Labor Party there will be a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly in the Northern Territory before the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that something should be set down to explain what the position will be when this Assembly is <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not one word to explain what this <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no indication of the role of the Northern Territory Administration after the creation of this fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly means in the Northern Territory, its members can bet their last shilling that  Mr Connor  will not hand over one tittle of power regarding the operation of minerals and energy in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that a statement has been made by the Government to the effect that it hopes to have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly by the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can take 19 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members, 2 teaspoonsful of hope and a dash of finance and you can have instant government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These branches can become immediately responsible to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of Northern Territory people and not to a far distant Minister who never now even bothers to set foot rn the place or even communicate with the people of the Northern Territory either officially or unofficially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable Minister appears to be far too busy of late to come to the Territory to discuss matters with <span class="highlight">elected</span> members even when they have paid him the courtesy of writing to him and indicating that urgent discussions are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst one can say it is grand that we are seeing movements towards the establishment of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council in the Northern Territory- all would support that view- one has the greatest regret that the Minister and the administration in the Labor Party in Canberra do not have the ability to set a proper foundation for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>30 came to this House from the other place to set up this Joint Select Committee to look into the very things that we are discussing today, one which is of prime importance being the establishment of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> council for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory to have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly before 31 December 1974, and the question of referred powers to be one for negotiation and determination before then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is printed in our platform that we would give the people of the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly before December this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I was able to give attention to the functioning of this Committee, as I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government at present has a majority of members in the Council because we nominate certain members as well as having members <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory, no doubt this Government will see that its members are adequately remunerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the Legislative Assembly will have been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, we will have other work to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all recognise the need for this <span class="highlight">elected</span> body in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from listening to the debate it appears that the criticism of the Government’s action centres on the fact that this decision to provide for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory was taken before the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory makes its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not debating the principle of the establishment of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson)  made it quite clear that the Committee ‘s report, in conjunction with his own discussions with the members of the Assembly when they are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, will form the basis of the procedures that will be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, and I am sure those who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Assembly, will rely heavily on what the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also should be made known that the present <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council did not want any extension of their terms of office beyond that for which they had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, that is, beyond 23 October next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all in all, we have the position where there is unanimous agreement that there should be an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body in the Northern Territory, and the legislation provides for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">elected</span> body in the Territory is something that we all basically want to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this legislation is passed through the Parliament we can say that the Northern Territory is on the road to the thing which I think most of us want to see, that is, a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the wishes of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council that the Territory should have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly as a matter of priority and that there should be 19 seats in that Assembly, my colleague the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson)  asked the Distribution Committee for the Northern Territory to be ready at short notice to recommend the distribution of the Northern Territory into 19 electoral districts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not arguing about the ordinary services of government or the power of a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> to raise revenue for its purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first Victorian Parliament was <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the provisions of the Victorian Constitution Act, 1855. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Parliamentary Handbook of 1973 discloses that  Mr Nixon  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives for the electorate of Gippsland, in Victoria, in 1961 and that he held a ministerial appointment from 16 October 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all honourable senators and members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent the people of Australia, will he guarantee that parliamentarians will be able to reach Canberra to carry out their duties here next week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the honourable senator is basically right in the latter part of his question because the following year, after a Labor Government had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, Australia did support a resolution the basis of which was the resolution to which the honourable senator referred in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In opposing these Bills I want to make some remarks in this final stage of a debate which has been continuing since before this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the end result of a proposal which was designed by the present Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  prior to this Government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the promise that it would spend money in areas of need, and that is the philosophy of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the Government that has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office is concerned with the quality of life rather than with the commercial interests of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances the quality of representation would be greatly undermined as electors faced continual changes in both their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that we are afflicted in this country- I use the word ‘afflicted’ advisedly- by Upper Houses which are not democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>, which are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, which flout the very principle about which Benjamin Franklin talked in his words that I read to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most important part of our democratic structure that governments should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of one person one vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day after day he argued that it was undemocratic and unfair that a government should be frustrated by senators who in some cases had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> several years before Labor came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, quotas are determined on population and the first 75 members that were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place were <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of roughly 50,000 electors per member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as legislators, not just to become mere letter carriers to indicate that they have made some telephone call to a Minister and therefore that they are representing an area well- not at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of a double dissolution caused by senators who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis that they will look after State rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, as a result of the double dissolution we did remove a splinter Party which supported the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party through thick and thin but did not have enough votes to have one person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no obstructionism from the Senate if we are democrats and recognise that the voice of the people can be expressed in 2 chambers each <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a democratic basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, one looks at the quotas which senators have to achieve to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the States of New South Wales and Victoria at a periodic half Senate election, and then looks at what would be required to elect a senator from the Territories one will have not only a remarkable admiration for the dexterity with which the one vote one value principle can be espoused and then denied by members of the Labor Party, but also a picture of how unjust the representation would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1970- the figures would be greater now, of course- a person required almost 300,000 votes to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a senator in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> a senator for the Australian Capital Territory all that would have been required in 1973 was 28,000 votes and to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> a senator from the Northern Territory all that would have been required was 10,600 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can understand the system, senators, who are not State government people and who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate as representatives of the New South Wales Government, the Queensland Government, the Victorian Government, the Tasmanian Government or the Western Australian Government, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate according to a different system of elections than those relating to the House of Representatives, but just as members of the House of Representatives are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that House to represent the people of a particular part of Australia, so too do senators represent people and not State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little while ago in the House of Representatives we heard the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  say in respect of one of the measures that the Joint Sitting will discuss tonight or tomorrow- I refer to the National Health legislation which proposes a health scheme on which this Government campaigned and was <span class="highlight">elected</span>; it was proposed first to the Australian people in 1968 and was restated in 1969, 1972 and 1974-that he and the Opposition would go to the barricades rather than yield one iota, one inch, to the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an artificial argument to consider that members of the Senate are voted for and are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the electorate of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rather thought he would be most apprehensive after the allegation which he has made about people who have been validly <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a corporation which was established by vote in this chamber and, in the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now he queries the basis on which those people were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, we believe that as the Northern Territory moves towards statehood it should be given an opportunity to have the same sort of Senate voice as every other State, not a watered down Senate voice with senators who are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for less than a full term and senators who are to be restricted in such a way as to reduce the power of those who are normal members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not surprising that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council have for a number of years pressured Federal governments to give Senate representation to the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that all senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as House of Representatives elections are held, we have written this present provision into the Bill which we hope after today will become the law of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somehow it is suggested that because people live in these territories they are unworthy of being represented in the Senate and that <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives from the territories should not sit in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on different terms and at different times but with powers equal to any other bona fide senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was largely due to the pressures applied by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council that the former Liberal Party-Country Party Government made a firm offer to the Northern Territory towards constitutional advancement and executive power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On present growth forecasts if they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the time of the next electionin about 3 years time- they would each represent more than the number of people represented by each senator from Tasmania, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take a broader view and look at all the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people in the States, the position is even more remarkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we in the Australian Capital Territory had our new assembly of 18 <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative assembly members, 2 members of the House of Representatives and 2 senators, we would have one <span class="highlight">elected</span> person to more than 5,000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the smallest States, we see that Western Australia has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> member for each 387 electors, South Australia has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> member for every 527 electors and Tasmania has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative for each 480 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not go before the people in an election campaign and advocate a policy in opposition of Labor, and then because the Government got a miserable majority of 5 in one House and a minority of 2 in another, come here and desert the causes that people <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people on adult suffrage with potency equal to that of the gentlemen and ladies who inhabit the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are to go out every time the Prime Minister goes to the hustings, in the hope that he can get a Labor senator <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They <span class="highlight">elected</span> 6 senators and 5 members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the realities of the Senate: Because it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> equally from the States, it is almost bound to be equally divided after an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me say something about it and for it as a non-voter in the Australian Capital Territory but as one who has been deeply involved in it ever since I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place 19 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well take the honourable member for Moreton at his word and have 5, 15 or 50 senators from each Territory, but so long as they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the system advocated and proposed in the Bill it will not make a jot of difference to the balance in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable Minister appears far too busy of late to come to the Territory to discuss matters with <span class="highlight">elected</span> members even when they paid the courtesy of writing to him or indicating that urgent discussions are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are members of the Opposition parties being so complimentary to us as to say that the Australian Labor Party will receive over twothirds of the votes in each of those Territories and thus have its senators <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What conceivable difference can it make from a party point of view if there are 2 senators from each Territory <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of proportional representation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not reason suggest that there will be one member in support of the Government and one member in support of the Opposition <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each of these Territories? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that in the House of government the Australian Labor Party has a majority to which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and in the Senate a combination of misfit organisations holds a majority owing to the flukes of preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always been a little mystified as to why the fact that someone was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1899 makes him more sagacious than somebody who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that each of those 2 senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the proportional representation system on each occasion that the elections take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are to be senators from the States <span class="highlight">elected</span>- the public has voted for this at Senate elections- separately, if necessary, as States and groups of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are to be Territorial representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a formula of by-elections, quite differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we have been regarded as obstructing the wish of the Australian Government to introduce its health scheme, I believe that I represent the people of Victoria who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to this place, and I assure them that it will not be my vote that will enable a nationalised health scheme to be introduced into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the Senate is a States House because there are 10 senators from each State <span class="highlight">elected</span> to it so that an equal representation from each State is maintamed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under our out-of-date for the 1970s form of government, with the States warring with the Australian Government, a hostile Senate with extraordinary powers able to frustrate the will of the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Representatives, members of the Opposition have plenty of opportunities to practice this obstructionism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that meeting the members of that Committee <span class="highlight">elected</span> me as their  chairman  and, when I was responding to the honour that they had bestowed upon me, I mentioned the services rendered to the Committee by its former  chairman,  the former Western Australian senator, Hartley Cant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with its Party platform, on the basis of which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in 1972 and reconfirmed in that office last May, the Labor Government lays great emphasis on the need to approach the development of Australia’s uranium industry in an orderly and coherent manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 24 May 1971 the Liberal Party of Australia, Queensland Division, selected me to fill a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of  Senator Dame  Annabelle Rankin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 18 May 1974 1 was again <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Queensland including- I emphasise the word ‘including’- a special vote of confidence by some 20,000 citizens of my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aborigines in Queensland should not be worse off, by virtue of the fact that they have a Premier <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a minority vote, than Aborigines in other parts of the country who live in States in which there is properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> majority rule in the State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is required in this country is a consistent attitude which enshrines the public interest as represented in the government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people and seeks to check the unrestricted exercise of power by groups who cannot claim the legitimacy of public support which the Government which exercises power can claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a situation in which people may belong to a union for three or four months, because they happen to work in the Shepparton canneries or the wool industry for three of four months, it is absolutely ludicrous to say that they should be placed in a position n of equal importance with officials and <span class="highlight">elected</span> officers of that union who have contributed to its running over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have enormous problems of interpretation which in fact multiply the difficulties which the Minister seeks to overcome and which undermine the authority of a union leadership which, when it is appointed, ought to have the respect of the union membership after it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> in accordance with democratic procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and constitutional rights, but is the States’ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign states formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources of their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following those actions of the Government in 1973 in relation to tariffs and revaluation, we had in 1974 the May election which was brought about by the refusal of supply to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this context that the people in my Party who selected me and the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> me in Western Australia would expect me to make judgments on matters which affect Western Australia and to exercise the power which has been vested in me as a member of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was reminded the other night that during the last election campaign  Mr Snedden  said that interest rates would  have  to go up, before they would come down, even if his Party were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again let us emphasise what  Mr Whitlam  was promising in the policy speech on which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>-  required to see the program through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions of the Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> do not support the promise made in that policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the 1972 general election campaign was being fought- nowhere was it fought more bitterly than Townsville- the Labor candidate and the then Labor Leader,  Mr Whitlam,  made it clear that if Labor were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office it would immediately provide funds for the construction of stage 2 of the Ross River dam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the best discipline of all to make certain that those who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> are people of the proper calibre and integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conflict of interests surely is the most important matter for us to consider, but to me it is overridden by the knowledge that when a member is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate or the House of Representatives or obtains public support by vote and is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a local council or to a State parliament there is a demonstration of public confidence in his record and an acknowledgement that he is a man of some repute, a man of honour who will vote fairly on matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It no doubt has a lot of substance when related to the House of Commons, an <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, in its relationship to the House of Lords, a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why, from the moment the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, it has worked unremittingly, ceaselessly, to attack inflation at its roots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, I am so bold as to say that probably the best speeches on the Budget which have come down in this session were given by newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But,  Sir, I  have a great deal of worry about you as the representative of the Senate, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader of the Senate and the  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important aspect about the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party is that for the whole of this century there has been a great party representing about half of the people- sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less than half- and it has evolved a democratic structure whereby delegates are <span class="highlight">elected</span> properly from the various States and from trade union organisations to conferences at State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I would like to refer to a remark which sometimes one hears or reads in the Press in Tasmania in relation to the representation of its <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would show the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> us to this place- on whichever side of your chair,  Mr President,  we may sit- that we are vitally interested in what is going on and that we earnestly desire to get together to try to formulate a plan that will act as a solution for the disadvantaged people in Tasmania who have suffered, unfortunately, for too long a period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bessell suggested that the reason for the travelling to Tasmania by Ministers of this Government which has gone on since we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 was that we recognised that we were in some difficulty in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance we have an agreement between the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of Tasmania on a State basis and on a Federal basis to further the interests of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives in 1966 I quite naturally took a very intimate interest in railway projects, particularly in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late in the election campaign when I was gaining some confidence, and recognising the dangers of a politician’s making any promises, I said at Whyalla that when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives I would ensure that a railway line was constructed from Port Augusta to Whyalla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, if a branch has become defunct, participation on the union’s committee of management of representatives purporting to have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal body to represent the branch may result in invalidities in the proceedings of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of this chamber I felt that I had the right to do so and to say the things that I said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Opposition ought not to remind the people of the disastrous period that it had in office and its disastrous steps in forcing a government, which was properly <span class="highlight">elected</span>, to go to a premature election at which the Opposition was defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It rumbles still and talks about what it might do to prevent the properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia carrying out its mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned previously in this place that the Government, having assured the people when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 that it would not increase taxation, eventually imposed a 10 per cent increase in company taxation on proprietary limited companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder which is closer to the people, whether it is the Minister who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House or the Commission without the responsibility to the public and in the fashion as  Senator Greenwood  recommends it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think it is fair to say that the trade union movement in general around Australia worked very hard to have a Labor Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 and again worked very hard to have that Government stay in power in the election in May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that at the next election- whenever it comes- the trade union movement in general again will work very hard to have the Labor Government re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>, as it will be, because again that will be to the advantage of the members of the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in so many areas of government, it was necessary for a Labor Government to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power in this country before any serious attempt was made to grapple with this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I want to say is this: A government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and constitutional rights, but is the States ‘ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign States formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources for their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office a report was prepared by that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The councils are commonly called the third tier of government but their representatives are directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people in a way that makes them probably the most responsive of all <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the meeting which was held, I think in Essendon in February 1 974 where a council was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, which is the interim council for this western region, various accounts were given as to the circumstances in which the members of the council were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is another area which causes me very grave concern: We have <span class="highlight">elected</span> groups already established in this country which are being bypassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat what I was saying before: Local government councils <span class="highlight">elected</span> in open elections are closer to the people than these regional councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked  Mr Hewitt  to discuss with me the question of Palm Island at the time he visited this democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What concerns me further is the fact that although male senators are under some restriction as to what they are allowed to wear in this chamber, female senators appear to be under no restriction because if I look to my right tonight I can see a newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> female senator,  Senator Coleman,  dressed in what I would describe as an open-neck shirt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one wants to know about the obstruction all one has to do is turn up the record of the Senate to see an unparalleled performance of frustration and obstruction of a duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We accept him as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the people of South Australia but I am a little disturbed that he, as a representative of the people of South Australia, should come into this chamber and use these two housing Bills we are debating tonight as a vehicle by which to denigrate the Premier of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Services and Property: Is he able to offer any reasonable excuse on behalf of the present Labor socialist Government as to why such utter failure has followed this Government and why the Australian Labor Party was unable to win even one seat in the fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for which elections were held some weeks ago? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has happened, therefore, is this: Some 2 years ago the Whitlam Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a fraud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were asked to remember the situation that obtained when they <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Government in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a greater tribute than any I can pay to recall that, after his first term, U Thant was re-appointed for a further 5 years as Secretary-General, and would have received the confidence of the United Nations for a third term had he not <span class="highlight">elected</span> to retire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is therefore proposed to require an elector to mark his order of preference on the ballot paper only up to the number of candidates to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, not a single senator could be <span class="highlight">elected</span> until about 3 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the responsibility of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government in Victoria some 10 years ago, through its State Electricity Commission, commenced the investigation ofthe power needs of Victoria to meet peak loads and to meet the overall requirements in the latter part of the 1970s through into the 1980s and so on for the balance of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time that that statement was made the Victorian Premier properly said that the unions attitude represented a defiance of parliament and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one result of a system that does not require electors to vote for all candidates whose names appear in the ballot paper is that a candidate may be declared <span class="highlight">elected</span> although the total number of votes credited to him falls short  or  the required quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been shown in many places on many occasions that a first past the post system, or a system of optional preferential voting which is perhaps a prelude to first past the post, is a form of voting which has <span class="highlight">elected</span> minority governments on many occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This system was tried, as  Senator Wood  said, in Queensland in the 1930s and when it last operated there, in 1941, 1 notice that with something like 5 1 per cent of the votes the government of that day was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with 66 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to get dragged into discussing what was said because I would then be making the same mistake of going into a Committee debate, but  Senator Wood  took an over-simplistic approach when he said that the full preferential system is the perfect system because if the first candidate is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> he then looks to preferences from the second candidate assuming he is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> and so on down the list of candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With all the cries that come from the other side of the chamber about self-determination and all that sort of jazz, it seems strange that over the years there have been only three, or two, Aborigines so far who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to any parliament in Australia- myself here for the Liberal Party, and a chap in the Northern Territory <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing in this Bill and nothing in the financial Bills which the Government puts forward indicates any acceptance of that principle, and it will obviously not be before another government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> that that principle will be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence would tend to support the view that a large number of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils on the various reserves in Queensland do not want some of the provisions in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason it is the Opposition’s view that debate on this Bill should be adjourned to enable the Government to consult with the Aboriginal people living in the reserve communities in the State of Queensland and with their <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils and other representative bodies, and further to ascertain, by a poll taken within those communities, the wishes of those people in relation to future restrictions upon the right of entry to those community areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is carried, on the motion that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting or for a later hour, whichever the Minister would like, I would move that it be the first day of sitting in March 1975, to enable the Government to consult the Aboriginal people living in the reserve communities in Queensland, their <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils and other bodies and further to ascertain, by poll taken within those communities, the wishes of those people in relation to future restrictions upon the right of entry to those community areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position under Queensland law is that no person can enter, visit or reside on a reserve without a permit from the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> council- not from any European or anybody of that nature- and the main purpose of the Bill is to maintain that condition on these reserves and settlements and on the islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely these lands should rightly be controlled by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of such a body and not by distant Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘the Government’s’-  wish to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory by 3 1 December 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Committee set up by the Government recommended in its report that there be control of urban land by the newly and fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that people will argue against the fact that the acquisition, provision and pricing of urban land will be done more in the interests of the people of the Territory if it is done by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Assembly who are responsible to the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that statement he said that he would refer to the full <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly, a decision on a request by Darwin nudists to establish a free beach in the area, but he will not give that Assembly the power to legislate and control urban land in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government came into office it had already stated 2 policy objectives which are relevant here: Firstly, it wanted to stabilise land prices throughout Australia; and secondly, it wanted to give the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly and then transfer certain functions to it after a joint committee of this Parliament had examined self-government measures for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the second objective of the Government the Minister has moved quickly to give effect to the first stage of constitutional reform for the Northern Territory, namely, a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Rae  in the concluding stages of this debate tonight: Let the Opposition tell us, not next week, not next year, but now, before the debate on this Bill concludes, specifically what it will promise for the King Island shipping services if it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not the right of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government to make appointments to senior positions in the Public Service and government instrumentalities, and was not that right freely exercised under the last Liberal Party-Country Party Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of last year the Prime Minister on many occasions stated, and stated correctly, that the Government had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 3-year term to implement the policy which it had put before the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding  Sir Charles  Court’s assertion that inflation could be beaten State by State, what has happened since he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> is that the consumer price index for Western Australia, which at the time of his election in March 1974 stood at the national average, has rocketed to 58 per cent above the Australian average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the argument that the proportional system must prevail throughout the term of those senators- basically that is the argument which the Government is putting- it is saying that if 5 senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 6-year term, two from one group and three from another group, that proportion must remain for the totality of the 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is saying that the practice which has been followed since 1951, as I understand  Mr Odgers’  book, should be followed for the sole reason that a person was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a proportional representation system of voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition, who came to the Senate under a system of proportional representation, stands here and acquiesces in  Mr Lewis’s  stand, because those of us who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament by the people of the States that we were chosen to represent have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> because we are members of a political party, except perhaps  Senator Townley,  who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as an independent member of the Parliament but who became a member of the Liberal Party yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is humbug for a senator to stand in this chamber and say that  Mr Murphy  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament as an individual and not as a member of the Labor movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> .in 1967 as the second candidate on the Labor ticket in New South Wales, and he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> again in 1974 by the people of New South Wales as the number one person on the Labor ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind honourable senators that the Premier of New South Wales himself has not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of New South Wales as Premier of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House of Representatives is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by way of a preferential system and the members of the Senate, all 60 of us, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that a mere 7 months before the people of New South Wales by their votes had <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Mr Murphy  and other Labor candidates to this Senate,  Mr Lewis  is now cutting across the expressed wish of the people of New South Wales and determining to rip up that convention and that vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  and  Mr Anthony  wanting  Mr Lewis  to take this action because I dare say that if he did take such action then the next person to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> would probably be a member of the Country Party, in view of the fact that the last candidate on the ticket who was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the 1974 elections was a member of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had an election in 1972; the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with a 3-year mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance there is an attempt by a Premier of a State government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> when he was not the Premier to usurp the power of the ballot box and of the people of his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We would then have a situation that across Kings Hall we might have a Liberal-Country Party government that had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> a year ago, 2 years ago or even for the gestation period of 9 months, which is somehow said to be damaging to us because  Senator Murphy  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> only 9 months ago, and in the Senate there was an adventitious majority for the wicked socialists of 3 1 senators to 29 senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is understandable that we on this side of the chamber have a respect for the Premier of that State of Australia, but surely as parliamentarians we all have a respect for any <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of any House of Parliament in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President, various Acts passed through this Parliament are now residing in the High Court of Australia under challenge by the States of Australia because those Acts were devised by the Commonwealth Government to circumvent what have been the accepted and traditional roles of State Governments in the exercise of their <span class="highlight">elected</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that much thought has been given to the filling of casual vacancies in this Senate not only in order to preserve the balance of the representatives from the various States of Australia but also to keep in mind the spirit of the Australian Constitution and the system under which we are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators are assured of the Government’s intention to reestablish the city, and given the continued cooperation of <span class="highlight">elected</span> community representatives, the business community, the trade union movement and the many individuals and organisations all with a view about reconstruction, we will proceed with rebuilding as we have done with recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to these considerations, we are also concerned that the citizens of Darwin and their leaders should have an opportunity to consider this measure- not only the citizens of Darwin but the people of the Northern Territory generally and particularly the members of the recently democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was  Senator Jessop  who, by interjection last night, spoke about my blackmailing the party in South Australia into preselectingwe will ask him when he comes backMartin Cameron as a replacement senator in this place and who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by South Australia - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was in days when senators were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a system which resulted in a ludicrous spectacle- on one occasion of 33 members being on one side of the chamber and 3 on another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term of the person coming in to fill the casual vacancy is temporary, ad hoc or interim until there is another election giving the opportunity for that person to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 1 5 of the Constitution, in committing the decision not to a political party, not to an Executive and not to an independent, but to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the State Parliament, I would have thought commits the responsibility to a body democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> and constitutionally indicated in that section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most satisfactory way to ensure this result, the Committee considered, was by a provision in the law that any votes credited to an ex-senator be transferred to the next in line according to his ballot papers and the candidate <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a continuation of the count would serve until the expiration of the term or until the election of a successor at the next election, whichever should first occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To transfer to a political party the right which now belongs to a parliament of a State <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people is a very big political bridge to cross. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be it noted that the claim that is made for this so-called convention- I call it a practice, I want to be specific- is not that the next on the ballot paper shall have the adoption from the State members of parliament but that the nominee of the political party of which the vacating senator was a member shall be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of both Houses of State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twice in a little over 2 years the Australian people quite clearly and quite definitely have <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Australian Labor Party to govern this country for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This fact has not been accepted by the people who sit opposite or by the people whom they really represent- the people who are opposed to the policies which the Australian Labor Party is trying to implement, with the support of those people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> it to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government in Western Australia appointed to the Senate a man who was here for only a few monthsthe State  President  of the Country Party in Western Australia- something which would in normal circumstances have made it much easier for him to be re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> and to retain  Senator Prowse  ‘s seat in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If you are going to depart from the principles which govern a parliamentary democracy and make enough people think that, though they voted in an election and <span class="highlight">elected</span> a party to govern, that is really meaningless and all sorts of steps can be taken to abort what they have tried to do with that vote, those people who are already dissatisfied because of economic circumstances and do not like the economic system will also have a contempt for the political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You do not preserve the democratic system by engaging in shabby tricks and manoeuvres to gain a majority in Parliament to which you were not <span class="highlight">elected</span>, nor do you gain it by discrediting the judges of the courts of this country who have been appointed in the traditional manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate, but he was chosen by the Government to accept a judicial post and he accepted that judicial post, as other members of the present High Court of Australia did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that now and in the future the Government and this Parliament must have the closest regard to the views of the citizens of Darwin, to their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and to the community groups that have been formed, and will be formed, to express the views of the citizens of Darwin in relation to the rebuilding of their city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives who hitherto were supplied from the local government representatives have been abolished and in their place a bureaucracy has been appointed subject to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is strange coming from a Liberal Party which recently sponsored in New South Wales a change in the whole local government system which would vest more power in the general manager and less power in the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives by virtue of the general manager system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Commission which was appointed by the Askin Government was designed to remove certain powers of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and to vest them in the general manager. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances, what action has been taken by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of Darwin those members of the Corporation of the City of Darwin and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the former Northern Territory Legislative Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a great tragedy for the Australian nation and for the compassion that was expressed in the weeks after cyclone Tracy, it would be a tragedy for the people of Darwin, and it would be a tragedy for the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of Darwin in the Legislative Assembly and in the Darwin City Council if we did not seek to improve the building code and to learn from what has been an obvious example of what could happen to Darwin in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The local bunch of newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, because of their political persuasion and because the Labor Government was promising to rebuild Darwin, tried to wreak havoc in everything the Labor Government proposed for Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite cannot camouflage that by saying that members of the Legislative Assembly were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any sitting member in this Parliament, no matter in which House he is, is campaigning from the day he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> until the day his election comes again and that gives him an enormous advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seem to recall that even that sort of thing happened in Victoria many years ago until the Victorian electors decided that it was about time they got rid of the types of governments which had tolerated that sort of thing happening in Victoria and they <span class="highlight">elected</span> Liberal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Have honourable senators noted that a Labor socialist Government which proposes that one vote one value is the true type of electoral system was able to nominate who would be the electoral officers and the redistribution commissioners to give the Government the criteria on how the electorate should be broken up and how there would be the first fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill can be criticised because it is totally unfair to those smaller parties and minority groups which may wish to have their views put forward or perhaps be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  referred primarily to the ability of persons on the staffs to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and to what they could do before the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We found, and in fact are still finding, people being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a council on a vote as low as 25 per cent of the potential vote in municipal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the time I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the national Parliament- twenty-two years ago at the end of this month- I refused to accept what was then the conventional wisdom that the sole or chief concerns of the national Parliament should be foreign affairs, defence, the annual Budget and the level of the major social welfare payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of that old approach was that the functions which a modern community requires should be performed through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives were either done inadequately or not done at all, were financed inadequately and unfairly or not financed at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this way the national Government will be able to have direct financial dealings with local government bodies in helping them to do the job for which they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be remembered that this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2 December 1972 and that on 15 December, within the first fortnight of operation of the Government, the Prime Minister issued a Press statement announcing the setting up of a judicial inquiry into the legal recognition of Aboriginal land rights and the appointment of  Mr Justice  Woodward to conduct the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the specific platforms of policy on which this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to powerand re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>- is that we would expand the activities of AIDC to enable it to do its job more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the House of Representatives is brought to an election in a period shorter than the period of 3 years for which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, of what concern is that to the Senate, the constitutional chamber of this Parliament of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If half the members of the Senate are <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a time they will represent a continuing view which changes over the years, and a real measure of stability must be introduced by that measure alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other most significant feature of the Senate’s being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in halves is that it provides the Australian people- the electorate- with a real opportunity to pass judgment on the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the specific platforms and policies on which this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> was that it would expand the activities of the AIDC and enable it more effectively to do the jobs that it was designed to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is to be said to be the way in which we are to fund the exploration for and exploitation of our natural resources and /or to assist our own secondary industries and rural industries, why should that sort of technique and that philosophy not be employed through the representatives of the Australian people as <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people and not through the board of directors of company A or company B? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not sure whether members of the Opposition, in their blind thrust for power, realise that if we backtrack 12 months- the period mentioned by  Senator Withers-  from 1 2 April, it takes us back to a point approximately half way through the first Autumn session of the new Parliament, when the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Labor Party Government had not even been in office for 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The electorate believed that when a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> it should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 3-year term, more particularly in the case of a government that has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice in  Vh  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the criticism that has been profferred of me by  Mr Scott,  the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> or recently appointed  President  of the Australian Film Council, may I say that on 20 February of this year after the passage through the Parliament of the Australian Film Commission legislationthat is, after the Senate passed the Bill- I received the following telegram from  Mr Scott: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ensures that the person <span class="highlight">elected</span> is preferred by 50 per cent plus one of the electorate, and what can be more democratic than that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another example of the Government’s determination to deprive small parties and individuals of their right to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> is contained in its proposals to lift the deposits for Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill introduces the proposition of optional preferential voting, a system whereby a voter will have his vote counted, so long as he has marked the ballot paper to cover the number of members to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems somewhat strange that we should be facing this very lengthy Bill of some 74 clauses on electoral laws when only 1 1 months ago the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  suggested that there would be no such changes and that he would seek no changes to the electoral laws in the life of the Parliament that was then about to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are among the most important areas that concern a democratic society- the way in which the Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span>- and indeed there are very many countries around the world today that bear evidence of the extraordinary traumas that will result if we depart from the democratic methods that we have in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are occasions when independent candidates, because they receive that support, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> from various places on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> last year I think it was about 1 per cent of the vote for the top group in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system works there, and it would work elsewhere, I suggest, where the will of the people- the desire of the electorate- in relation to the type of government they want to see in power has been expressed and the government of their wish has been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That ought not to be the basis upon which people are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people cannot get the man or woman they want to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, under the preferential voting system they have the opportunity to sit down and to say: ‘If I cannot have this person I will have that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However today the State of Queensland is back to preferential voting, the system by which members for both Houses of this Parliament are at present <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we should cast the net widely and make the voting system elastic so that notwithstanding the faults of the voters we get as many votes as possible, and that when the election result is announced it is what the people of the country really intend- a government of their choice <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern this country for the following 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Daly’s  office was responsible for the legislation to give the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party holds seventeen of the 19 seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and its members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a system of optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will be interested to see how it performs in the Northern Territory in the years ahead, its members having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> under this system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we heard of one honourable senator here being <span class="highlight">elected</span> under one party name in Western Australia and taking his place in the Senate as a member of another party, the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, optional preference voting is one of the most sensible amendments to the Australian electoral system since its creation 72 years ago, and deserves the support of all who take an interest in the way parliaments are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who advocated the introduction of preferential voting in 1917 and earlier had in mind the need to make sure that the person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent a constituency genuinely enjoyed the support of a majority of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems that the Government is making another attempt to alter the electoral laws of this country, about which it has had a preoccupation since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government and came to power in December 1 972 and also since its quite narrow election victory in May of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs a result in which the people, by their votes, say who they do not want to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as well as who they do want to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have in this country electoral history which tells us that exhausted votes do occur and that they can complicate the correct decision about who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and who has not, and they can be the cause of much dissatisfaction and disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that in these times a person who has some chance of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> and who genuinely has some support in the electorate would be able to raise that amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This occurred because the system that we have in our Party insists that all members of the Government must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by Caucus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caucus is composed of the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Bill the Government is attempting to restrict the freedom of one or more persons to form a party, calling itself what it likes and seeking to get candidates under that banner <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, if one wants to go back to a basic principle, members of Parliament are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as individuals; they are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> as party servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had to stand under our own names as candidates for the Senate- as  Mr Withers  or  Mr McLaren-  without the backing of our parties and without giving an undertaking to the electors that we would support the policy of our parties, we would have no hope of being <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have said that they are independent, but having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> as independents they switch over to a political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position as I understand and know it is this: It has happened on a number of occasions that people have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> as senators of the Commonwealth of Australia in December, which was the normal time for a Senate election, but were not to take office until 1 July the following yearsome have been public servants and one is now a Minister in this House- and they had to relinquish their Public Service office and then wait some time before being sworn in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This section has never been tested but all the legal advice that has been tendered to persons in this situation has been not to continue in their office of profit under the Crown after they have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> even though they are not to be sworn in until 6 or 7 months later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was a court reporter in the Commonwealth Reporting Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department and had to relinquish this position almost 7 months before he was sworn in because he had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, although he was not then a member of this chamber within the meaning of this section of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he contests a State election he can hold that position of train driver until such duy as he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> or is defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The meaning of this provision has never been tested, but the advice that has been given to persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Senate, even though they are not to take their seat in this chamber until some 7 months later- and this has happened on a number of occasions- is that they must first resign from their office of profit under the Crown, and they have been advised not to continue in that position during that 7 months period even though they are not in that time officially members of this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not pretend to know the electoral Acts of the various States but perhaps that may be a device which could be looked at, that is, that a person resigns conditionally upon his being <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament may not be sitting at the time, and I believe there is a lot of merit, if we are to make this national Parliament open to those who want to stand for election, in having some form of procedure that will enable the member of another parliament to contest an election either independently or as an endorsed candidate and, if not <span class="highlight">elected</span>, to retain the seat he had in the other parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result of a Senate or a House of Representatives election in a close seat is not made known until 1 7 or 2 1 days after the date of the election, and the pay of a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> starts from midnight on the date of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the member of the State parliament so <span class="highlight">elected</span> would be entitled to Commonwealth Parliamentary pay from the date of the election and may have, because the end of the month had come, received pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my leader, the father of  Senator Michael  Townley, came along and congratulated me, having had a little confidence that I was going to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> I had my resignation from my position of temporary public servant as secretary to the Leader of the Opposition signed and in the hands of  Mr Townley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Hall’s  amendment were accepted there would be no reason why very quickly the necessary legislation could not be inserted into this Bill to make sure that everything be of a watertight character and that people would be receiving a salary and allowances from only the one parliament to which they had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well to say that they may have been freaks, oncers or oddities who got thrown up in odd electoral circumstances; the simple fact is that they were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks over a large proportion of elections in the past 30 years, I think one can see that it is fairly clear before midnight on polling day which Party will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also draw there for positions when they line up for the race, and this is the way it ought to be when we line up for the greatest race in the world, namely, to see who can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I always remember  Sir Robert  Menzies saying that a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament under a certain system of voting never changes that system, because people who do not like it bring down their wrath on the government at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regarding whether there is a so-called donkey vote- and I hate that expression- if one looked up the records of the 1966 election, when Prime Minister Holt was returned to power with the biggest majority the non-Labor parties have had in my term in the Parliament, one would see, I believe, that 23 new people were <span class="highlight">elected</span> as members of the Liberal-Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite a large percentage of seats in Australia are or have been semi-blue ribbon or blue ribbon seats but in the 1 966 election the people of Australia- they were not changing a government, but were re-electing it to office with a new Prime Minister- <span class="highlight">elected</span>, out of a total of 123 members, 23 new members to the Parliament from the non-Labor Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know that good old candidate X or good old candidate Y, to whichever Party he belongs, is going to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and they tend to be somewhat careless in marking their ballot papers for House of Representatives elections and certainly for Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister will agree that wherever optional preferential voting has been used and wherever there has been a quota for the election of senators- even going back to the New South Wales experience in the 1920s- exhausted votes have meant that quotas could no longer be met for the later candidates to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems strange also that the Government should be proposing to make this alteration to the electoral laws at this time in view of the fact that on 11 April 1974 the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  gave an undertaking that there would be no changes in the procedures of electoral laws in the life of the Parliament which was at that time about to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system of voting which is proposed, although it is mandatory to vote only for the number of persons to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>- one in the case of a House of Representatives election and five in the case of a normal periodical Senate election- every voter has the option of indicating further preferences for some or all of the remaining candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a Senate election the number to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> is five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed optional preferential system, which allows for optional marking of preferences beyond the number of candidates to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, is fair and it eases the burden on the voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that  Sir Vincent  Fairfax and his fellow members of the board of the Australian Mutual Provident Society are entitled to make a deduction from the premiums paid by policy holders in that Society in order to wage a campaign against the Australian Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on this policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a majority vote and, because of the voting system, the Opposition in this House has been able to pursue a wrangling opposition for 2V4 years by knocking back whatever legislation it wants to knock back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate is properly debating legislation which was properly placed before the House of Representatives and properly passed by that House, in accordance with the normal procedures of the Parliament for bringing legislation before the 2 Houses of Parliament, for the purpose of implementing the policy upon which this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 and reelected in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy speech was a comprehensive one which sought to change the emphasis of government in this country and to fill up the gaps which had resulted from years of neglect by the Opposition parties which now have nothing but their brutal numbers in this place with which to try to sabotage and defer the policies on which this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and which it is trying to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a program and it has not introduced any major pieces of legislation in its  2Vi  years of office that was not a part of its comprehensive program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot be said of  Senator Townley  that he has remained a member of the Party for which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, because he went to the electors as an independent and he has now come under the cloak of the Liberal Party to safeguard his place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact what used to happen was that, instead of these Country Party politicians tramping around their vast electorates, within a year of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> they moved to the city to live, outside their electorates and they were never seen except when they were canvassing for an election or when the local show was on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While there should not normally be provisions to prevent an Aborigine from going on to a reserve it was felt that it would be desirous for the town councils, which are <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the laws of the Queensland Government, to have the right to say who should go onto reserves in their areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal community with its <span class="highlight">elected</span> council ought to have, in our view, the right which is being given to it by the proposal now put forward by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision would be made by the council which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note, as  Senator Button  has said, that despite the allegedly spontaneous demonstrations which have been taking place throughout Australia the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> executives of both organisations have at no stage expressed opposition to the establishment of an <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that if that is their view they take it up with members of the AMP Society Staff Association who, as I understand it, are very well satisfied with the representation which is given to them by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials of their organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Australian Government was not prepared to assert the rights of the established Government of South Vietnam, a government, may I say, <span class="highlight">elected</span> in accordance with democratic processes, which could not be said of the Government of North Vietnam which was seeking to overthrow it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is a matter of current concern is the fact that the Government in Chile, albeit a government which has come into power by overthrowing the constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, has been recognised by the Australian Government as the valid Government of Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the recent history in Chile, a legally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government that was seeking to produce some reform and improvements in the social relationships in that country was overthrown by a combination of military forces - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Given enough time I can produce authority to indicate that the subversion- ‘subversion’ is a word that  Senator Greenwood  is very fond of- of the legally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of Chile was assisted and advanced by the CIA and by some rather sinister forces in American society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second thing that has to be clearly understood is that the dead  President  of Chile was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by about 34 per cent to 36 per cent of the popular vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, even if the point were to be made that the armed forces did have the right which by some curious source of misinformation  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack relies upon, even if the armed forces had that authority, I should have thought that the honourable senator would have been well aware of the fact that the Chief of the Chilean General Staff, General Gonzalez Prats, opposed the coup which took place against the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government and fled the country and was subsequently murdered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack told the Senate that  Dr Allende  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with 34 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> ultimately he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with over 60 per cent of the votes because the Christian Democratic Party supported him in the run-off election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If only we had a television camera and if every word of  Senator Greenwood  could be heard and every gesture and grimace of  Senator Wright  could be seen we would not need to spend a penny on any election campaign; we would win with an undisputed majority, the same sort of majority as that which was gained by  Dr Allende  when he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>  President  of Chile in the last democratic elections that took place in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then our old colleague,  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack, a former  President  of this Senate, a man who is somewhat out of date, entered the debate in defence of an attack by the military junta upon an <span class="highlight">elected</span> parliament, and this seems to me to be quite improper in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have made no secret of the fact that a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government in Chile was overthrown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told at the last Committee meeting when I raised questions that we, as members of the Parliament who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Joint House Committee, have very little power at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true, and the Government must be given full credit for the fact, that soon after it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in  1972  it established a committee, which is now known as the Hope Committee, to inquire into and report upon the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the national trusts I think it is worth noting, as the Hope Committee report itself notes, that in  1972-  at the end of which year the present Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>- there were no fewer than  37 000  members of national trusts in various parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> a senator I sometimes thought, when I listened on the radio to speeches in Parliament, that people so often proceeded to find their government white and every other government black; they discovered that everything has started from the moment their government came into office; they could see nothing wrong with anything that had been done since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure we all realise that under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund legislation introduced by the former Minister for Defence,  Mr Barnard,  Lieutentant-Colonel Newman would receive a lump sum of about $23,500, if he wished it, plus approximately $5000 a year which would have been a help if he was defeated in the election and retired to the farm that he already owns in Tasmania and would have been a very healthy addition to his parliamentary salary if he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the advances which were made up until we went out of government were taking the people of the Northern Territory along a quite clear course which was leading to selfgovernment, which was in accord with the wishes of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Councillors and the national Government and which, if oppurtunity had been allowed to develop, would have provided a tremendous satisfying form of selfgovernment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although naturally such a disorganised rabble is unlikely ever to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, at the same time the Government believes that in the interests of constructive debate in this chamber there ought to be some sort of unity within the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those figures might give the Australian public some idea of the type of frustration, the deep seated frustration, that this Government, duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2 occasions by a mandate of the Australian people, still has had to suffer at the hands of the combined Opposition parties in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers,  who is not only the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate but also a member of the Standing Orders Committee, and I tended to agree that we should set out to preserve and protect the rights of back bench members of the Parliament, particularly those of a person who is not a member of a political party but who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate as an independent senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is said that, if an insurance corporation were responsible to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the country, for some reason that has not been explained, it would develop into some sort of juggernaut which would erode civil liberties and ride roughshod over the interests and desires of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not read the whole of that statement, but the Prime Minister made the following points: It remains Australia’s firm policy that Papua New Guinea come to independence as one country in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government were pouring vast sums of money into an unprofitable enterprise then it would be answerable at the elections in a way in which the directors in Zurich, Amsterdam, London and New York of insurance companies that are operating in Australia are not responsible to their policy holders when they use their funds to defeat a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he noted that, despite the Opposition’s declared intention of abolishing the Prices Justification Tribunal if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government, a senior businessman at the meeting is reported as supporting the Tribunal because, among other things, the work and self-examination required for submissions to the Tribunal are good for the  companies themselves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it receives the support of all sections of the community and not the knocking sort of attitude that our opponents in this chamber have tried to attach to it, this country will be quickly restored to a state of total prosperity, and the disadvantaged people whom we have set out to assist since we were first <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972 will not have any of their rights eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator McAuliffe referred to Disraeli and brought to mind a story that I believe true about Disraeli and which is very applicable to the honourable senator’s speech: A young member of the House of Commons, recently <span class="highlight">elected</span>, went to Disraeli and said:  ‘Sir, should  I make my maiden speech at the first opportunity?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, and I acknowledge this quite objectively, the implementation of the expenditure program on which the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1 972 was a final contributing factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They take their learning from yesterday’s newspaper and do not understand that as recently as 1900 this chamber was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a democratic basis, in sharp contrast to the hereditary basis of the House of Lords which by that time had been reduced almost to a position of complete impotence in respect of money measures, with the authority to reject any measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the very sad thing about this Budget is that if the sentiments contained in it had been in the hearts and minds of the Government supporters when they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1 972, they may well have gone down in history as a great reformist and most successful government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, after this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it was decided that it was not necessary for us to pursue this matter because Australian pensions generally became portable from May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proper and, I believe, the appropriate and perhaps the normal way to deal with a redistribution proposal is to put it before a freely <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, such as the Senate is, and to take a vote upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Senator Webster  did not tell the Senate was that the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can honourable senators imagine the <span class="highlight">elected</span> member giving representation and service to the people of that vast electorate of Flynn? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So as he passes  Senator McAuliffe, Senator Sheil,  myself or any other of our Queensland senators in this building he must feel ashamed to think that he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber to represent so few people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a common Electoral Act, so there is no room for comparison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am not sure whether this has been so ever since Federation, but ever since I can remember- that goes back at least 30 years; some of my Tasmanian colleagues may be able to be more precise and help me with this - the Parliament of Tasmania has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a system which follows- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1912 the Tasmanian Parliament has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a system which follows the federal boundaries, and the federal boundaries have never deviated more than 20 per cent; or at the time of the redistribution, the federal electoral boundaries did not deviate more than 20 per cent from the mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as this Senate was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, yet the Government is always going around saying that the Senate is acting unconstitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I submit that those people are represented in Parliament because when a member is <span class="highlight">elected</span> he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent all the people in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there was an electorate with, say, 100 people and 3 candidates for election, and the first candidate got 35 votes, the second candidate 33 votes and the third candidate 32 votes, on first past the post or optional preferences voting the first candidate would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> with 35 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I may sit here wearing other hats, but I have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and sworn in as a senator for my State, and nobody is going to take that away from me, be it the Government or my own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election, and upon his continued authority in the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Public finance becomes a remote problem to most people who, once they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> a government to manage their national affairs, presume that financial negotiations made on behalf of the people will be carried out with legality and integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who put their faith in Labor, those who <span class="highlight">elected</span> this Government, in truth did not elect it for that socialist activity, but we have seen in almost every area a pro-socialist, pro-communist attitude expressed by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can we be surprised if the people who have some hopes of a reform and who see that a reforming government such as ours, no matter what mistakes it may have made- I freely concede that we have made mistakes- is not to be allowed to govern but is to be thrown out because there is an adventitious majority against it in the non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> House, decide to abandon the parliamentary system and resort to direct action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can our opponents not see that the mere statement of those figures refutes the notion that this House should in any way in matters like this be on an equal footing with the House of Representatives which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by all the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House but he seems to be overlooking the compact of federation in its Constitution and in the way in which it represents the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be a House which has the recognition of the present Government because of its eagerness to add to its numbers and to use the Constitution in a way that could add to its numbers members <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the people of the Territories of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To suggest that this is a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> House, as has been done by the Minister, is to be grossly inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the consequences, if we wish to use that word, which perhaps has led the Government to its present attack on the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Senate of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 28 February 1974 and 10 April 1974- the time when the Opposition threatened to reject Supply to the Government on the last occasion; a mere 1 8 months after we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office- there were 45 divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only since that time- as a result of  Senator Townley  becoming a member of the official Opposition after he had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> as an Independent, as a result of  Senator Murphy  retiring from this place to become a Justice of the High Court, and as a result of the death of  Senator Milliner  from Queenslandthat the Senate is now in its present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So even before Mr Fraser was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the leadership the Opposition had the information which now constitutes what is claimed to be reprehensible circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had a lot of talk and pious cant about there being no prohibition in the Constitution to their carrying it out; but they are seeking tonight to reject a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, and the Senate is not a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, whatever they might try to say about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told that the Opposition, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government, would introduce at a cost of about $ 1,000m tax indexation straight away in response to the call of trade unions which have persistently sought wage indexation and tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is remarkable that as soon as a Labor Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> a section of the business community says: ‘It is time for us to button up’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is because this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> last year for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact was accepted by the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, only a matter of weeks ago when he supported the contention that if a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 3 years in the House of Representatives it is entitled to serve out that term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that there is one essential difference between last year and the present time, and that is that the vote that the Opposition was able to muster yesterday was as a result of the death of a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senator from Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives, the Bill having been floated in the House of Representatives, having been debated in the House of Representatives and having been passed by that place, we now believe that a message setting out the terms of the Senate’s determination yesterday should be transmitted to the House of Representatives for the information of the members of that place and for the Government in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purposes of this Bill are to make special long service leave provisions for those New South Wales and South Australian teachers who were employed in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory respectively in 1973 and who <span class="highlight">elected</span> to join the Commonwealth Teaching Service before 1 January 1974; to enable provision to be made for the employment of teachers at technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory; to alter the name of the Service to the Australian Teaching Service; and to make other amendments to the legislation arising from the provisions of enactments which have been made since the Teaching Service legislation was last amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the issue that will be fought is the right to obstruct the people’s democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never changed or flinched from my acceptance of the fact that when we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1974 those who were given the majority in the House of Representatives were given the mandate to govern and those who were given the numbers in this Senate with the power to qualify that power of judgment were given it for a purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover the Senate is as democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> as is the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arguments which are derived from the days when upper Houses were hereditary, were property based or were <span class="highlight">elected</span> from a restricted franchise have no relevance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The often quoted dictum of  Sir Isaac  Isaacs in 1947 that the Legislative Council of Victoria erred in withholding Supply in 1 947 was directed towards the impropriety of a House <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a restricted franchise frustrating the will of a House <span class="highlight">elected</span> on adult franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in 1952 in the State of Victoria the upper House, which at that time was partly <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a restricted franchise but which was controlled by the Australian Labor Party, used its powers in the Legislative Council to take to the people a government of a different colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there are 2 democratically representative chambers, each <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time but existing in constant conflict, why should the people not be given the opportunity to resolve that conflict? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposal which is being put by the Opposition is, in effect, that the Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice within the last 3 years, should be subjected to a third election within 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no opinions from learned counsel or professors of law but I do put to the Senate that the position at present is that in December 1972 and again in May 1974 the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Labour government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have found since they <span class="highlight">elected</span> that Labor Government in 1972 and reelected it in 1974 that constantly that Government has been unable to introduce major parts of its program, that most of the things which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do it has been unable to do and has constantly had to conduct its business in an atmosphere of crisis and under the threat of being driven from office, a situation which is intolerable at the best of times and especially damaging in the situation in which we find ourselves at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that because of the letter of the Constitution the people of Australia should not be entitled to have the Government which they have twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> within 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is, of course, that the system we propose is considerably less restrictive than that applying for Senate elections between1919 and 1931, under which electors were required to express preferences for double the number of candidates to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, plus one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) 1975 which I introduced earlier today, whereunder electors should only be compelled to express a preference for the number of candidates to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, is also inherent in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system proposed by this Bill a candidate cannot be <span class="highlight">elected</span> unless he has received more than 50 per cent of the votes in the count at the stage he is <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as an independent senator to do justice for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  started by saying that the Premier will not tell him that the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament or House has no right to refuse supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of that democratic process this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 to serve for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a Prime Minister can defy the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament there is not need for elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the responsibility and the seriousness in the action of the Opposition in deferring the Appropriation Bills and also in making this new move to reject a message from the House of Representatives, which is the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, which is the House that has the support of the Australian electorate and which is the House that, in association with the Senate, should guide the destiny of the nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first assertion- it is a wrong one, because each of the 5 claims is wrong- is that a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office constitutionally should be permitted to remain in office for the whole of its term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the principle of Parliament is this: The power of the purse, the power to tax the people and to control the taxes of the people should lie within the Parliament and should lie within the power of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people of the Parliament- not that it should lie in the Commons or the lower House, but that it should lie within the hands of those who are democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>, whether in the lower House or whether in the upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate- I need not do so- that the Senate is as democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a general franchise of all the people of Australia as is the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind them that there are specifically <span class="highlight">elected</span> wholly and democratically by the people of Australia some 30 Liberal and National Country Party senators on the Opposition benches, not nominated in any way - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 30 such senators fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the figures today and by the mandate of the people the Senate Opposition can, all of its members fully and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, negative any legislation that is brought forward by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Whitlam Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it was, in its own euphemism, transferred to power because it had a glorious and devine right to govern, but if the Opposition were to be given a mandate to govern it would be, in the Government’s words, seizing power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anyone doubt that when we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government we will inherit the worst mess of major problems that has ever been inherited and that the task before us will be a formidable one? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to Opposition senators that this Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and is committed to bringing in innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they deny us the opportunity to govern for the <span class="highlight">elected</span> period of time to see these innovations work they should not expect Labor senators to go to the trade union movement or to any group and say that by evolution they can achieve their objectives because they cannot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are using the mechanism of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators in this country to force this Government to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for all these reasons that having had many messages from people whom I respect and who are concerned at this time- and I have had many more messages from people who are obviously supporters of the Government in relation to dealing with this situation- I insist, as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> senator for Australia, that the constitutional provisions to deal with the deadlock between the 2 Houses of Parliament should immediately be put into operation by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should allow the democratic process to take effect so that we can have a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> which will have the confidence and trust of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In actual fact, in the time of the Hawke Labor Government, both  Mr Lynch  and  Mr Diver,  members of the Country Party, stated their attitude that the platform on which the Hawke Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> was such that the Government should be allowed to have Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communications I am getting openly state that the people concerned do not necessarily support the Labor Party at electionsthat they may not have voted for the Labor Party at the last election- but that they will not stand idly by and watch the Opposition in its attempts to gain control of the Government benches when we have a freely <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, twice freely <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, already on those Government benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are reminded- it is true- that the Government was returned to office on that occasion, but it is not brought to the forefront of people’s concern that when the Government was re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> 1 8 months ago it was re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> with a majority that was reduced in the House of Representatives from nine to five and it failed to gain control of the people’s only brake in this Parliament, the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Lords is not, as is the Senate, an <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by exactly the same number and character of people as elect the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Senate are democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike most other upper Houses, the Senate is a people’s House, fully <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election, and upon his continued authority in the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not go into this in any great depth, but just to set the record straight for the benefit of  Senator Carrick  and the people who read  Hansard,  when the 1974 Senate election was held 29 Labor senators were <span class="highlight">elected</span>, one Independent, one Liberal Movement-  Senator Hall-  28 members of the Liberal and Country Parties and one member ofthe National AllianceSenator Drake-Brockman from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to their election, and as a breach of faith with the people who had <span class="highlight">elected</span> them,  Senator Drake-Brockman  joined the Country Party, subsequently called the National Country Party, and  Senator Townley  joined the Liberal Party, which gives the Opposition its current number of 30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 28 were <span class="highlight">elected</span> as Liberal or Country Party senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia- the Government solely because the people gave us a majority in this House- must now so conduct ourselves that this act of aggression by the Senate shall never again be attempted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxpayers’ control over their money through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the people’s House is the foundation of parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister suggest that the Senate is not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is not a House of Lords; it is a duly constituted and <span class="highlight">elected</span> body which has the right to speak for those who elect it, who are the same people as those who elect the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concurrent with that right, that privilege of democracy, there is the responsibility of all <span class="highlight">elected</span> members to take upon themselves the task of surveying government expenditure, deciding whether the Government is acting as it should, and whether that power of the purse is being exercised as it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every honourable senator who is present knows that there is no equivalent in the House of Representatives of the sort of surveillance that is meant to be given by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people to the disbursement of public funds as is given in the Senate Estimates Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When this debate, which drones on and on like many in this place, is extended further into the population of this country, it will be about whether an Upper House, not <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same democratic basis as the Lower House in this country, should refuse Supply, therefore throwing out a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Steele  Hall and others have said, the question will be: Should an Upper House in this country throw out a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government in a Lower House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard  Senator Wright  and others state that this House is as democratic as the Lower House, it is a people’s House <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disappointing to me that the members of a party, which for some extraordinary reason calls itself the Liberal Party, in this House will follow the instructions of this group and will obey the call of those who attempt to defeat this democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election, and upon his continued authority in the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 for a term of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time will demonstrate that this Government, <span class="highlight">elected</span> as it was for its 3-year program in 1974, will be vindicated and endorsed by the majority of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it not a fact that despite the claims about the great return of the Government at the double dissolution election, the Government was returned in the House of Representatives with a reduced overall majority, and with very small majorities in some electorates, and that in this Senate, which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the same electors, the Government did not secure a majority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people will not surrender the support for the Government which they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Lords has taken the view that it should not have the right to throw out of office a constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the warning to the Opposition that, because of the very nature of this House, because it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of proportional representation, governments in the future will have to hope that death takes a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as has been said by the Prime Minister time and time again in this last week or so, by making decisions to amend, delay or reject the Appropriation Bills we are placing an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government into a twice yearly crisis position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all recall that in 1949 he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to put value back into the pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Isaac  Isaacs and other eminent constitutional lawyers have constantly placed before the Australian people the need to see the Senate as a House of review and not as a House bent to bring down the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The draftsmen and founders of the Australian Federation, familiar as they were with colonial ( to become State) patriotisms and sometimes sharp differences of policy, devised a Constitution which provided for a Senate made up of an equal number of senators from each State, and a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> by individual constituencies and therefore representative, not of States but of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all such general matters, the clear fact is that the Senate has become a party house, senators from each State (except for one recent exception in Tasmania) being <span class="highlight">elected</span> on party tickets, and therefore becoming members of the parliamentary parties, adhering, broadly, to their party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in Commonwealth political history, the majority Government party in the House of Representatives has <span class="highlight">elected</span> a senator to be its leader and Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable senator that if he has any complaints about radio station 2JJ he should raise them with the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Professor Downing, or with the General Manager of the ABC,  Mr Duckmanton,  or he might like to discuss the matter with  Mr Marius  Webb who just recently has been appointed a commissioner of the ABC, after being <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the staff of the Commission and who I understand is an operator of radio station 2JJ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite true that the inquiry was established in October 1971 by the previous Government and that upon Labor being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972 the time was extended for  Mr Justice  Toose to complete his report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They must be feeling very sad for the Government for which they had such high hopes when they <span class="highlight">elected</span> it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mal Fraser, the Leader of the minority Party in the House of Representatives, has, at the behest of  Mr Anthony,  instructed the Liberal-Country Party Opposition to block Supply and to try to force the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government to the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Senate uses its executive powers to dictate to a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, then we can say that the principles embodied in a free constitution are irrevocably lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are creating a state of affairs which strikes at the very heart of the Constitution, about which we have heard so much, and which strikes at the very heart of the people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> folk to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the Constitution requires a government to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> every 3 years and because the expressed will of the electors should be observed in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those conventions which we all understand and know about in the Senate deliberately set out to provide for periods of stability of government on a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be but for the very grave consequences of the course which the Opposition has adopted and but for the line of argument which the Opposition has followed in its tortuous search for reprehensible circumstances to try to justify that criterion which  Mr Fraser  laid down when he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> Leader of the Opposition and from which he has since departed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be all right for  Senator James  McClelland to say, as I remember him saying yesterday, that the Senate is not a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House; but it is a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Prime Minister’s claim that the removal of a government from office before the end of the term for which it has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> would be a blow to parliamentary government and democratic institutions is manifestly untenable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have already had extensive references to the attitude adopted by the now Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  in 1970 when he clearly indicated in the House of Representatives that the then Labor Opposition proposed to oppose the Budget, to destroy the Budget and by destroying the Budget, to destroy the then Gorton Government, a government which I point out had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> at that time only 10 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation in which we now find ourselves would not have arisen if it had not been for the lunatic course upon which the Opposition set itself, namely, to try, for the second time within 2 years, to destroy a government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the first time less than 3 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason it is hellbent on destroying the Government which the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> by overwhelming majorities in 1 972 and 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that if a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 3-year term it is completely improper and completely undemocratic that an undemocratically constituted Upper House should be able to pick the time for that government to go to an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also submit that the Federal Government’s intention to eliminate the differentials in Nursing Home Benefits between States, is an action contrary to the Labor Governments’ 1974 policy speech on Social Security Benefits and Welfare Services, delivered at the Fitzroy Town Hall on May 1 , 1 974 on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They follow an endless sequence of manoeuvres which the Opposition has pursued in order to remove a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here is somebody who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the leadership of the Liberal Party- admittedly he has attained that high office by stepping over innumerable corpses- coming into that position at a time when there is a world-wide economic recession and when there is inflation and unemployment in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is essential in the interests of the Australian public to understand precisely what has happened since the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Government in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Government on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means briefly this: If we take into account that this statement was made on 10 April 1974 and if we traverse back the period of 12 months which was referred to by  Senator Withers  it is seen that the Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2 December 1972 was not even half-way through its first autumn period of the new Parliament when the Opposition determined to destroy that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that we were legitimately <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 3-year period then, similar tactics were employed in May 1974 when the gallup polls in the early part of the year showed that the Government could be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the people are for the Labor Government in the great majorities that have been suggested, what an easy ride home the Government would have by accepting the situation upon which the Opposition has placed its confidence, namely, that the people ought to be consulted as to whether this Government is entitled to the supply of money by us- the people who are representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the taxpayers who provide the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would expect that there should be some justification for the manner in which a government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 3 years was subjected to re-election after serving 18 months in office and, after getting a second mandate from the people found that after another short period it again had to face the people as a result of an action which I have described as being contrary to the Constitution of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But when that Labor government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, we found that it could be thrown out by a  coup d’etat  and that that Government could be defeated by the powerful Press of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a group of people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to fashion their lives to living on the dole, and in some cases to living as a group in a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to utilise a system that we have introduced for the purpose of obtaining their livelihood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is far better for increased leisure time to be in the hands of those who have selected it than of those who are forced into it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we cannot provide job opportunities we should seriously consider whether our contribution should be to ensure that such people are not in competition with those who wish to work or living a life that is other than they have selected and is resulting in their taking income away from another section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It can be anticipated that the Government will now run its 3-year term of office, but precedents have been established that make it essential that we look seriously at the Constitution and consider whether the State-<span class="highlight">elected</span> House should have the right to have supremacy over the people-<span class="highlight">elected</span> House to such an extent that it can in effect dismiss the people-<span class="highlight">elected</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The word ‘junior’ referred not to the position to which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> but to his cerebral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Labor Party of the Eleventh Parliament, which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 1 1 November 1928 and dissolved in September 1929. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only were my colleagues and I cheated, but the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> us and reelected us in May 1974 feel a sense of being cheated in that they also believed that we were being <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a period of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that we of the Australian Labor Party find ourselves in a somewhat similar position at present because since we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government in 1972 we have been threatened with a type of political terrorism that has been unknown in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of the Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Australia for the time being for the good management of public affairs of Australia and that I will not directly or indirectly reveal such matters as shall be debated in Council and committed to my secrecy, but that I will in all things be a true and faithful Councillor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition naturally is opposing the motion moved by one of the newly-<span class="highlight">elected</span> senators in relation to the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General’s Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, it is the usual practice in such a debate for honourable senators to express felicitations to those who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to high office and it is in order to welcome the newlyelected senators and to congratulate those who have made their maiden speeches as well as, of course, to extend to you and the  Chairman  of Committees congratulations on reaching the office you and he now hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has to be said and certainly what the newly-<span class="highlight">elected</span> senators have to learn is that what one says in this place has very little relevance, very little value, in terms of parliamentary democracy, in terms of one’s contribution to the maintenance of parliamentary democracy and in terms of one’s understanding of the way in which our society operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has a political party got to do to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and to carry out its responsibilities to those people who put it into public office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that the principle or precedent has been established that the Governor-General has the power to dismiss an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She made a valid point by saying that we really find little significance in the actual election results if we do not accept the fact that it is in the House of Representatives- in the popular House- where governments are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Already admissions have been made in the depositions of those inquiries that people involved in that organisation have brought about the overthrow of <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments and assassinations of <span class="highlight">elected</span> leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now read how the popularly and properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Premier of the Congo, now described as Zaire, Patrice Lumumba, was shot in cold blood after being kidnapped by forces under the orders of the CIA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now learn that General Schneider, a personal friend of the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> President of Chile, President Allende who was Chief of the General Staff in Chile and also a constitutionalist, was murdered following his abduction by agents paid and encouraged by the CIA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also congratulate him on the fact that he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> only 1 8 months after the last  President  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would have thought 3 years ago that twice in a period of 3 years a new  President  of the Senate would be <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As one honourable senator put it to me the other day: Who would have thought that he would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> 3 times in 5 years for a 6-year term in the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also congratulate the  President  because it appears from what has happened in the past few months in this chamber that he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the office of Presiding Officer of one of the most powerful legislative chambers in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a chamber which can apparently force elections at whim, can reject a Budget, can defeat a government by delaying a Budget and can defeat a legislative program which the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the office the  President  has taken on, I respectfully submit, an awesome responsibility, so much so that I feel a sense of awe in my heart when the Usher of the Black Rod announces the  President  each daythe same sense of awe as no doubt would be struck in the hearts of Ugandan parliamentarians when the equivalent officer announces the  President  of Uganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Be that as it may, the  President  has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point which I wish to make is simply this: If a parliamentary system is to work- as I came here 1 8 months ago believing it ought to work- it should work on the basis of a government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to fulfil a program over a defined period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I come into the debate at a late stage, I wish to extend my congratulations to all the new senators and trust that I and they may endeavour to use this Senate to be objective and for the purpose for which we were all <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Legislative Assembly for the Territory was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a first step towards giving the people both a voice in the administration of local affairs and a way to participate in the policies by which the affairs of the Territory are regulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of this Territory, I must fight against the developments to which I have just referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 recognised these facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first acts of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government in December 1972 was to re-open the equal pay case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That he should be <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees only reinforces my admiration for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like all of the new honourable senators and I suppose like most of those who have been recently re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> I am aware of the responsibility that I have towards the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> me, in this case the people of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing however detracts from our great State- and I think I must say this tonight- and that is the abysmally poor State government in Queensland which has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on malapportioned electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators probably fit into this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come here to represent the people of Queensland, the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to this chamber, and in representing them I intend at all times to fight for their rights, and I intend especially to fight for the rights of the underprivileged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also congratulate other honourable senators who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to positions both within this chamber and within their parties, and I congratulate those honourable senators who have made their first speeches in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the position to represent the workers and in having to spend my time simply in defending myself I felt I was getting nowhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13 December last year I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a senator for Queensland by almost 600 000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments were <span class="highlight">elected</span> and Parliaments served a term of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was one of the first things about which my Government did something when it was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that may be a new reason why the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Parliament with only about one-third its members being members of the honourable senator’s Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He attended only when he felt like it and then finally got off the Committee when  Senator Sheil  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to his place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the matter of old references which was raised by both  Senator Douglas  McClelland and  Senator Keeffe,  I hope that if and when the committees are established and the chairmen are <span class="highlight">elected</span> the chairmen will be able to come to some amicable arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst still in that position he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1941, as a member of the Committee of Management of the N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1954 he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the members of the Branch to the position of President, which subsequently was made a paid position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Committee of Management as its Federal Executive member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of a Labor Government coming to office, we found out that an agent of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was operating from our embassy in Santiago and playing a very difficult role, a nefarious role, an improper role in respect of the events that took place in that country and which subsequently resulted in the death of that country’s properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Government were <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the third time in succession, would the military take over the Government as has happened in other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I was reminded of what 4 officers of the Army were alleged to have said in Queensland, namely, that if a socialist or Communist government were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Australia they would not hesitate to overturn the government <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would happen if the South Australian Labor Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> 5 Labor senators in their place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although in the last 3 double dissolutions the question of who will have the long term of 6 years and who will have the short term of 3 years has been settled rather amicably by both sides of the Senate, it could so happen that in an election 30 senators from the Government side, 30 senators from the Opposition side and 4 independent senators or senators from a small political party were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 4 senators, could be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the preference votes of the other political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, instead of giving to the 5 senators who were first <span class="highlight">elected</span> in each State the long term in office and the 5 senators who were last <span class="highlight">elected</span> the short term in office, the Senate could easily reverse that position and give the 5 senators last <span class="highlight">elected</span> the long term of office and the 5 senators first <span class="highlight">elected</span> the short term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that matter should be looked at and that the practice followed in the past 3 double dissolutions could quite easily be written into the Constitution so that for all time the people of Australia would know, in the event of any elections, how senators would be placed and whether they were being <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a long term or a short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After 3 years of dynamic reform and unprecedented social change, we have had <span class="highlight">elected</span> a conservative government with the largest House of Representatives majority in a generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this: in modern countries, opportunities for all citizens- the opportunity for a complete education, opportunity for dignity in retirement, opportunity for proper medical treatment, opportunity to share in the nation’s wealth and resources, opportunity for decent housing, the opportunity for civilised conditions in our cities and towns, opportunity to preserve and promote the natural beauty of the land- can be provided only if governmentsthe community itself acting through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> representativeswill provide them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Speech sets forth the program of the Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 1 3 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I congratulate  Senator Drake-Brockman  on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> as  Chairman  of Committees and those other honourable senators who have been chosen to fill positions of responsibility in the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Nelson,  like his father before him, served as a member for the Northern Territory and fought for voting rights, an <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly and Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have achieved a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly, Senate representation and the development of local government in both European and Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So soon after the new Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> these types of views are rammed home, for example, by those representing sporting groups who, I presume, have written to all honourable senators saying how bad it is that they are missing out on sporting subsidies that they were to receive from the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the risk of encouraging or inviting criticism from the Government I propose to deal with some facets of those events when a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, twice preferred and twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> within 18 months, was summarily dismissed by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governor-General to dismiss an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government was a serious one, unprecedented in modern history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development will recall saying yesterday that continuing financial assistance for growth centres was now under review despite the Government’s assurance during the election campaign that, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, it would continue commitments entered into by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that  Mr Daly,  the Minister for Administrative Services in the last Government, was more considerate of the needs of backbenchers of this Parliament than any other Minister has been in the whole of the 26 years that have elapsed since I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that because I always believed that I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber to make decisions and not to hide behind outside bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the campaign Liberal Party members went to very great pains to say that they would defer this measure if they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office at a time when the Australian economy is experiencing the results of its most serious setback in the post war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament consists of two Houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate, each popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and each with the same legislative power, with the one exception that the Senate may not originate nor amend a money Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no analogy in respect of a Prime Minister’s duty between the situation of the Parliament under the federal Constitution of Australia and the relationship between the House of Commons, a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> body, and the House of Lords, a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> body in the unitary form of government functioning in the United Kingdon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Government having the confidence of the House of Representatives but not that of the Senate, both <span class="highlight">elected</span> Houses, cannot secure Supply to the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notoriously the new Ministry lacked the support of one <span class="highlight">elected</span> House; equally notoriously, the former Ministry was unable to continue governing constitutionally, for want of sufficient support in the other <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of the blue we were suddenly told that the merely titular non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> head of state had taken the matter out of our hands in a manner which offended against just about every canon of parliamentary government one can readily call to mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard  Senator Wright  desperately trying to whitewash the actions of the GovernorGeneral in dismissing a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election and upon his continued authority in the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a statement by  Mr David  Hamer who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result he was re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament under a system with which he himself did not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the honourable senator freely admits that in 1973, less than 12 months after the Whitlam Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, he was conniving to get rid of it by using the power in this place to deny Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that even though the Government was twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> within a space of 18 months the honourable senator’s Party did not accept the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have as Prime Minister a person who will go to those lengths to bring about the downfall of a government legitimately <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice in 18 months I think honourable senators opposite and the Liberal Party have a lot to answer for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators opposite that the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party and the Party’s organisation outside are determined to remind the Australian people continually of what took place and to show to what murky depths the Liberal Party sank in order to remove the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also take the opportunity of congratulating  Senator Drake-Brockman  on being <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it did not accept it, it would not have fielded candidates from the Territories to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say this in fairness to  Senator Kilgariff:  He appeared before the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory when we were examining the possibility of having a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> parliament for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the petitions of Helen Therese Berrill and Bruce Noel Hill, as tabled by the  President  in the Senate on the last day we met, 4 March 1 976, to the Court of Disputed Returns seek a declaration of the Court that all senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> for South Australia and Tasmania on 13 December last are not duly <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr Noble  in New South Wales carried out his duties to the best of his ability and with great satisfaction to the 10 senators who were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, they so manipulated what they are now prepared to call a simple machinery Bill, so distorted the proper role of the Senate as a House of review, that by what I and many people believe to be improper methods they brought about the destruction of a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How free are the people of this country when we remember how we were forced out of office in November last year after the Australian people at a free election had <span class="highlight">elected</span> a government for a term of 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government was swept from office and the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significant in this result was the fact that for the first time in over 20 years in South Australia we were able to return, as a first <span class="highlight">elected</span> senator, a candidate from the Liberal Party, not from the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I open my remarks in this debate by extending congratulations to yourself,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  and to the other office bearers who were <span class="highlight">elected</span>, including the  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that I am the last of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators to make a maiden speech, and I have a more difficult task as I am following a series of excellent speeches given by the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> basically to see that it is carried into full force and effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were <span class="highlight">elected</span> partly because of our commitment to the rights of people within the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said, and  Senator Button  distinctly said that we of the Labor movement accepted the verdict of the people but that we did query and we did express concern about the manner and the circumstances in which the election was able to be brought about by the dismissal of a previously properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed that concern last September, but again as recently as a month ago, on 13 February,  Mr Cairns,  now re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> by this time to the Federal Parliament, went to the trouble of issuing a Press release- he did not make a statement in the Parliament- saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since  Senator Greenwood  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government, he has not been prepared to further take that case to the Royal Commission into Petroleum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I look forward to that debate is that perhaps, somewhat naively, when I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Senate I thought that senators from both sides of the chamber would have the opportunity to debate proposals put forward by the Government and would be able to allow their feelings on all matters to be made known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1973 the Aboriginal council at Aurukun, which had 3 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members and 2 members appointed by the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, asked  Mr Frank  Purcell, a Melbourne lawyer, to act for them in their efforts to get land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am making a slur on the Government for not doing the job it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do and for not carrying out the promises to which the Government’s present <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appeared to me that the whole proposition may have been a brilliantly conceived promotional stunt, and typical of those which the recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> Mayor of the Gold Coast,  Sir Bruce  Small, might use on such occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The highest was in the 3 years from December 1949 to December 1952 when it was 52.6 per cent under the MenziesFadden Government which had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> mainly on the platform of putting value back into the pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both Bills, particularly the Social Services Amendment Bill, repudiate the promises made to pensioners and to pensioner organisations in the course of the election campaign of November-December last that the value of social welfare benefits in this country would not be reduced if a Liberal-National Country Party government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, neither Bill fulfils the promised policies of the Liberal and National Country Parties that there would be an instant and automatic adjustment of pensions and benefits in line with movements in the consumer price index if a coalition government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a new senator who had been recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> but who had not yet come into this chamber to be able to voice his opinion in this forum of the national Parliament, it disturbed me that such an announcement would be made before the Parliament was called together as, in this way, senators and members in the House of Representatives would not be able to use Parliament at that stage to voice their opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course they will next Saturday, ls there the slightest doubt that the decrepit Labor machine of New South Wales will not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> but will once more find itself in defeat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam would commit himself to visit Iraq officially in his capacity of the real and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Prime Minister of Australia and would cement the relationship on a strong and permanent relationship between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my own State of Western Australia, where all people are equal, but some are 16 times as equal as others because they have a vote in the Legislative Council of Western Australia which is worth 16 votes of other Western Australian citizens, quite massive income taxes can be and may be applied by a Parliament which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a basis which is democratic to the extent of a ratio of 16 to one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But since the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Fraser Government came into power last December we have lived in an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty on many Government projects, including water filtration, with hints of cut-backs and threats of reductions in financial assistance’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather ironical and, I think, hypocritical to hear senators indicating that the whole problem with Commonwealth-State relationships began in December 1972 when a Labor government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whichever way an appointment is made, however, the significant fact is that it is not made by the electorate but by a State parliament; for, in the latter case, unless the successor is earlier <span class="highlight">elected</span> or the appointee ‘s term earlier expires, a permanent appointment is made subsequently by the Houses of Parliament of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1949, however, senators have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a system of proportional representation and the effect has been to have a more evenly divided Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By deliberately altering the composition of one of the Houses of the national Parliament from that which the Australian electors set in 1974, a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government was eventually dismissed from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some trade unions which demonstrate and have demonstrated over many years that basic representation of the rank and file worker, but no one can say that where there is a union membership of something like 170 000 people and only -2000 of them vote the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> by those 2000 in any way represent the 170 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I would have thought that with the prospect of a third State Labor Government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> next week and a fourth State Labor Government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> next year also, the present Federal Government might have been alert to make sure that this did not happen and that the States would have to account properly for the way that the money was spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that prior to the Whitlam Government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 and before we amended the Grants Commission Act 1973 this organisation was known as the Commonwealth Grants Commission and it had been known as such from about 1932 or 1933 when it was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently it is the intention of the Government to confine authorities to <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government authorities thus, I suggest, including regional bodies such as county councils and other regional local government organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, what is intended is to provide for the manner in which a State can give to an area which has no <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government authority the services which normally would be provided by a local government authority if one existed, and to provide no further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Nixon  really thinks that this is important, I hope that his legal judgment is sounder than his political judgment because later in the statement he made on 23 April he said that the prospect of the Labor Party being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government in New South Wales was so remote that it was unlikely the people of that State would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was one of the reasons for this Government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 1 3 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that decision was that the partly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council of that Territory had power, conferred by statute, to make ordinances for the Territory, and such ordinances were no longer subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1929 a Labor government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, there were 14 per cent unemployed and the Who’s For Australia League was formed in Sydney; in 1931, this was absorbed into the All Australia League. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak on these matters not only because of my concern as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the people of the Territory but also because I think that the way in which the Government handles the situation in this Territory is a pretty good test of what sort of economic management it really can offer this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose it is fair to say that the pledge to introduce Medibank, amongst a number of pledges, was one of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 13 December last year- some 6 months ago- the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by an overwhelming mandate of the people of Australia, primarily because of the economic chaos that had been caused by the previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was made quite clear by the Fraser Government when it was in Opposition that it would introduce tax indexation if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 13 December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government that  Senator McLaren  supports, the Whitlam Government, promised that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power in 1 972 it would remove the tax on table wines which was imposed admittedly in 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would say to  Senator Jessop  that not only is this Government of which  Senator Jessop  is one of the junior supporters reversing completely what it undertook to do but at the same time it is completing reversing what has been the consensus of every advanced Western capitalist country since Roosevelt was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the presidency of the United States in 1932- that is, a modern country cannot be conducted on the basis that the business of the country is solely private business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple and sad fact is that the present Government is totally bereft of moral authority because of the sleazy circumstances- to use  Senator Hall’s  succinct phrase- under which it seized power and the succession of repudiations of its pre-election policy in which it has indulged since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the previous Prime Minister was often criticised by senators opposite when he was overseas on business, doing the work which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, does such a loan carry with it any conditions disallowing expanded social welfare programs and benefits to the Australian community such as have been laid down in the past to dictatorships such as Chile, which received funds from the IMF after the coup which overthrew the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Allende Government in September 1973? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A suggestion yesterday by former Liberal leader Bill Snedden that a Fraser government <span class="highlight">elected</span> on Saturday might have drastically to change Medibank brought a swift and sharp response from the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the Government, as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislator, has the right, and indeed, as I believe I said before, the obligation, to present on behalf of the people in the public interest all those attitudes and all those matters that are relevant to the state of the economy, which surely has to be taken into account in the final deliberations of these particular commissions or courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My contribution to the debate on the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill will relate mainly to the provisions for compulsory postal secret ballots and the limitation on the term of office of <span class="highlight">elected</span> union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in its haste to provide in the Bill for what it has been telling the people of Australia it would do if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government last year, had forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will try to put the blame on the trade union movement for strikes and election ballots that do not please the Government; ballots in which the wrong officials are <span class="highlight">elected</span> or officials are <span class="highlight">elected</span> who place too much importance on conditions and the welfare of the members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why I say this is that any trade union official in Australia <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office and doing his job in the interests of the members whom he represents has no worries about how a ballot will be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only the officials of unions who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by some devious means through the rules of their organisations and who do not carry out the objectives of their members and look after the welfare of those members who have anything to hide, who have any need to worry and who need to seek protection from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to retain their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last reference that I wish to make to the Bill now being debated concerns the provision seeking to limit the term of office of any <span class="highlight">elected</span> official of a trade union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Button  mentioned here tonight, several applications have been made to the Commonwealth Industrial Court regarding the tenure of office of <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have come to the conclusion that, having regard to the size of the union, the duties of its <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials, and the control over them by members as provided by the rules, their five-year term of office is not unreasonable, notwithstanding that it is a substantially long period of office for persons who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read the judgments of Dunphy and Joske JJ., and agreed with them that the five-year term of office provided for by the rules ofthe Australian Workers Union for holders of elective offices in the union is not unreasonable having regard for the nature ofthe union, its size, the many callings and industries it covers, its widespread geographical coverage, the great numbers of awards it obtains and administers, its complex and extensive administrative problems, the duties of its <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials and the control over them by members as provided by the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A five-year term of office, looking at the matter broadly, does not of its own nature appear to me to be oppressive, unreasonable or unjust, and I can readily believe that in the situation in which registered organisations find themselves in this country, operating under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and being involved in an elaborate system of compulsory arbitration, some such organisations might well regard a five-year term of office as most advantageous if strong-minded, constructive, useful and responsible work is to be done by its <span class="highlight">elected</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that the affairs of a particular branch of a trade union have become run down as a result of mismanagement by an <span class="highlight">elected</span> officer or an appointed officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>shall not provide for the dismissal from office of a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to an office within the association or organisation unless he has been found guilty, in accordance with the rules of the associations or organisation, of misappropriation of the funds of the association or organisation, a substantial breach of the rules ofthe association or organisation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not saying that there were not others but there was a strong feeling that this provision had to be made for the Clerks Union because it and the Government were somewhat sympathetic to each other and the Government could not have an alternative system to that which <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials for the Clerks Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975 and it has approached the issue from an administrative point of view having due regard to the concerns that are really worrying the people- the cost of their care, their choice and the real interests that they have in choosing their own form of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said in the short time in which I had to speak on the Budget debate, the main ground for the conduct of the then Opposition during the 1972-75 period in pursuing a course designed to destroy a government which had been democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice within 18 months was its claim: Elect us and we will correct unemployment, inflation and a great range of other things’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The private funds knew in advance that the then Opposition, when <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government, would introduce a levy and would create Medibank Private and allow it to compete partly with the private funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Government took that view, it was probably a doubtful decision but in the light of the political situation at the time and the harassment that was being displayed by the then Opposition against the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, it was felt that  per capita  expenditure for the education of tertiary students was overwhelmingly greater than for primary and secondary students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that I have overlooked something in the Bill which gets away from ‘nominated members’, but I would like the Minister to explain how the people from my own State of South Australia are going to be fully represented when their representatives on this Council will be chosen because the people on the body nominating them have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and are not persons who are in some way associated with local government because nowhere in the Bill does it spell out what association they have to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have the gall and the temerity to stand here and criticise a government which was properly <span class="highlight">elected</span>, which had to face 3 elections in 3 years and which had to face obstinacy and obstruction by the conservatives who never accepted the view of the Australian people when it was made clear on 2 separate occasions and who then used every trick in the political book to bring about the defeat of a properly and constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July this year in a statement to the  Canberra Times  he said that the reason why there was so much unemployment in New South Wales was that the Wran Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 1 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Less than 3 months after that election the Australian Prime Minister was not saying that a national government was responsible for unemployment but he was trying to lay the blame on the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government in New South Wales which had not even met to put forward its legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we consider that the final vote which <span class="highlight">elected</span> the last senator, who happened to be myself, showed a majority of 2016, those 10 000 plus votes tend to assume rather critical significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill recognises, however, that an unqualified requirement that persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a college must also be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the members of that college, can be disadvantageous to the organisation because of the possible loss of continuity of experienced management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The danger that we see in the alteration which is now made is that under the proposed alteration an appointed administrative officer of a union will be able to operate and, in fact, perform almost identical functions to the functions which are performed by an <span class="highlight">elected</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one of the grave difficulties which an <span class="highlight">elected</span> officer of a trade union faces and one of the grave responsiblities which he assumes that by virtue of his office and his election he is entitled to do certain things; indeed, he is bound to do certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal  President  of the Organisation, John Peter Maynes, was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal Council in approximately 1950 in an election by the Victorian Branch membership as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1954  Mr Maynes  has continuously acted as Federal  President  of the Organisation, having been reelected to the said position in 1956, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1972 and 1974 by the members of Federal Council pursuant to Rule 23(1) of the Rules of the Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year, John Grenville advised me that when he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> he was not a member of the Clerics’ Union and was not eligible to run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that if the union did this the national  president  could be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by 0.02 per cent of the membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I did not say that  Mr Carmichael  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a collegiate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A collegiate body of 20 could have <span class="highlight">elected</span> the officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he did mean that, I wonder how he views a circumstance in which I understand that in one union, which is perhaps the biggest trade union in Australia, less than 2 per cent of the membership <span class="highlight">elected</span> its leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who might be able to make such a contribution sometimes face great difficulties, whether they be financial, geographic or otherwise, to present themselves to their friends and to the vast membership of the union in such a manner that they have any chance of being <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently it seems that from the point of view of the far flung smaller branches and from the point of view of trade union members in the smaller States there is perhaps a case worth considering for instituting what we have suggested should be a one-tier collegiate system of voting under which a college is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a total vote of the grass roots membership of the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to 1973 officials in unions were <span class="highlight">elected</span> either under the rank and file system or under a number of collegiate systems according to the rules of the particular organisations involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To encourage this, the Liberal-National Country Party Government would provide secret ballots under Commonwealth Electoral Office supervision for the election of officers to <span class="highlight">elected</span> positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that by conducting elections along these lines and by giving maximum publicity to union elections more members will participate in the voting, and that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> officers will reflect the wants of the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be able to maintain their current leadership, which is not a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present leadership, which I repeat is not a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> leadership, will be entrenched by the legislation before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we will have an entrenchment of non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> leadership which will be able to possibly remain- I would say very probably in many cases- against the wishes ofthe rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only the organisation itself may exercise a choice; the rank and file members are stuck with what their non-democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative officials may decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defintion of ‘office’ is now extended to enable unions, that is, management of unionsagain not the rank and file members of unions- to appoint persons to undertake duties similar to those performed by an <span class="highlight">elected</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly the amendment introduced during the course of the debate in another place which provided that 15 per cent of the Federal college should not have to face re-election after they are once <span class="highlight">elected</span> is another way of eroding the rights of rank and file membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These choices are: The full-time office bearers may be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by either a direct vote of the rank and file members of the union or, alternatively, by a one-tier collegiate electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a large Australia-wide union which, under the previous legislation, <span class="highlight">elected</span> its office bearers by rank and file voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Carmichael and Halfpenny are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by rank and file voting - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each State the part time office bearers can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a multi-tier system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that the number of office bearers standing is not out of proportion to the rank and file valid members, which is the amendment about which  Senator Cavanagh  is talking, we have introduced an amendment to overcome the fact that when each State elects its office bearers, and when one of those office bearers is <span class="highlight">elected</span>  president  or secretary etc., that State loses its effective representation because the  president  must become the  president  of the union as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to have the confidence of the college behind them and are re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>, that is fine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they fail to have the confidence ofthe college, they are out, and a vote is taken, the  president,  secretary and the members of the executive are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the college which in turn is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will not entail a take over by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> collegiate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Determined by the Federal Conference of the ALP, all the members of which were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a collegiate voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put the proposition that in many organisations the collegiate system gives more effective rank and file control over the national officers than does the direct ballot system, in that the national officers are accountable to representatives directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file members who are very well aware of the real record of those officials and aware of their abilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This system also constitutes the accountability situation, where those officers must account to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people in the House of Representatives who opposed these provisions have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by or participated in the collegiate system in their own unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Government has come to his assistance with a provision that states that 1 5 per cent of the college need not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The application states that the rules of the Federated Clerks Union which currently allow for officers to be added to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the federal council for the purpose of forming an electoral college for the election of the office in fact are oppressive, unreasonable and unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A different situation applies, of course, in respect of the Federal President of the Federated Clerks Union, who is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file members of that organisation and who knows very well that unless this Government comes to his rescue and changes the Act before 13 November his position as Federal President is doomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Council of the Australian Workers Union is <span class="highlight">elected</span> with members coming from States on an equal basis, the same as the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am proud to support the fact that at all times the Australian Workers Union has <span class="highlight">elected</span> all its full time officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the then Minister for Labor,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, brought in amendments to provide that within 3 years the elections of not only the full time officials but anybody who was then carrying out functions similar to the role of those officials, should all be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the direct voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to be under the impression that once the college had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> it could elect anybody it liked as one of its full time officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> college must elect somebody from among its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 15 per cent from whom subsequent full time officials can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> must have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those office bearers must have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> originally to the college and by the college to those positions or, alternatively, to those positions by a direct voting system and must have held office continuously, though not necessarily the same office, since being first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, any person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a number of offices by a direct voting effort is eligible to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a federal council or an executive council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that office by a direct voting method he would be eligible to be appointed to the federal council, provided he did not represent any more than 15 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is <span class="highlight">elected</span> as an officer of a branch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is then eligible to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to fill one of the 1 5 per cent vacancies on the federal council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>means a method of election comprising a first stage, at which persons are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a number of offices by a direct voting system - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the college-  and a subsequent stage or subsequent stages at which persons are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by and from the persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the next preceding stage; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems clear to me that full time officials can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a collegiate type election, which is provided for in this Bill by the rank and file voting for the college and then that college electing persons by and from the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the first stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only qualification to that is provided for in clause 3 (d) which specifies that a number of persons not exceeding 15 per cent of the total number of members of the body- those members having had to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> originally in the college and having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a full time position such as secretary- may in future years be re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>, even though that re-election is not by the rank and file, as members of a college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently it is very impractical to require that all such persons should have to be regarded as holding an office in the union and as having to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on every occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may be doing work which is similar to that undertaken by the full time <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials but they are not in the same category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes, in accordance with the representations it has received from unions, that it is quite unnecessary and in fact impractical to require such officials to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the same way as the full time permanent officials are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By saying that, we mean he need never have been an <span class="highlight">elected</span> councillor, alderman, mayor, or whatever such officials may be called in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Legislative Council in South Australia half of the Upper House has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a restricted franchise- that is, every person did not have the right to vote for its members because they have been there so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am asking  Senator Carrick  to appeal to these members of the Upper House to pass legislation, which has been put up on more than one occasion by the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, to give adult franchise for local government elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that legislation is passed in South Australia we will not be equally represented on the State Grants Commission, nor will the Premier or the Minister for Local Government,  Mr Virgo,  have the opportuntly to select someone who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by all the people in the State who are entitled to vote, as is the case in Queensland where every person over the age of eighteen has the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is being frustrated in its efforts by a Liberal dominated Upper House which, in the main, has not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a popular franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also find it hard to understand why the Government resists the idea of giving properly and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> school boards a small amount of financial autonomy when both sides of the chamber have been happy to give to the private school sector almost complete autonomy in the handling of large amounts of government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Senate with a fair sort of background in the area of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this Government have a broad plan aimed at overcoming those problems or will we simply see a continuation of the  ad hoc  program that we have seen ever since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may say so in passing, it is interesting, when one hears remarks about who is running the country and about the shocking malfeasances of trade unions in organising demonstrations against policies of the present Government, to note that there was certainly no objection from members of the present Government when they were in Opposition to the use of policy holders’ money by insurance companies and to the time that was taken by employees of insurance companies, which again was a burden on the policy holders of those companies and allegedly mutual life assurance societies, in demonstrations throughout Australia against the Labor Government which was then in office, having been twice democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a program of introducing legislation similar to that which we introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the new Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972 it was obvious that this was part of the policy for which the Australian people decided to change the administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had more nominated people than <span class="highlight">elected</span> people, but it was the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people of the day who decided that the Aboriginal culture and art should be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had <span class="highlight">elected</span>, as I understood it, to pay part of the fee or the whole of it to a charity rather than to have it used for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing that has always interested me is why the Australian Labor Party should continue with its wish for the abolition of the Senate when, by its own admission, the Senate is the only democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> house of parliament in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, on their own admission, this was the only chamber in the Australian parliaments which had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the hopeful recovery that the Government promised when it took steps last year to belittle and remove from office a constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government has been deliberately stalled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three Aborigines shall be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the resident Aborigines of the Reserve in respect of which the Council is established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  chairman  of each council is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the members of the Council, both <span class="highlight">elected</span> and appointed, at the first meeting of a new Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because not all councillors are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, some chairmen might be appointed rather than <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, but with this qualification the Advisory Council is representative of Aboriginal people living on reserves in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the prospect of the Labor Party being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern in New South Wales was so remote that it was unlikely that the people of that State would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not take  Mr Whitiam  long to get busy after being <span class="highlight">elected</span> and announce that he was going to help the fruit growing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the 1975 election campaign, Liberal and National Country Party spokesmen promised repeatedly that the Community Health Program would be maintained if they were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the Labor Government has at least admitted that inflation is an urgent national problem, it seems that one of the first actions it would take if re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> would be to cancel the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Sinclair had asserted earlier in that same statement that the Labor Party would do precisely that if re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then said that if the Liberal-National Country Parties were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government in 1974 they would ‘ensure that the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty continues’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Patterson  replied to  Mr Sinclair’s  allegation that the Labor Government, if reelected, would cancel the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he actually said on 8 May 1974 in his Press statement was this:  the Labor Government if re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> would immediately cancel the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then again during the 1975 election campaign  Mr Sinclair  repeated his previous false assertion that the Labor Party would, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, immediately eliminate the bounty and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to the policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties on primary industry which forms part of the overall policy on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since being <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the Government has taken many actions to bring about a decrease in inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has since been considered as a local matter for <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Assembly to decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want them on the record because they show that this Government has not kept its promise in any way to the Aboriginal people since 13 December, which is the day on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In it  Mr Anderson,  who is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the Aboriginal people, points out the many unsatisfactory aspects of the Bill and the ways in which the Bill must be improved if it is to give a guarantee of land rights to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Aboriginal Land Councils, advised by lawyers, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the oldest tribal areas and spokesmen for the oldest tribal customs but we are now seeking to divide the Aboriginal communities by trying to convey the idea that there is a drunken element amongst the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been concerned that many times in this chamber we have heard Government supporters and Ministers <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Western Australia say that they do not read the Western Australian newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I speak of Western Australia so often because the people of Western Australia <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to represent them in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is expected by this Government that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly will introduce an ordinance to provide that persons such as policemen and public servants acting in the course of their duties, candidates for <span class="highlight">elected</span> office and members of the Australian Parliament or the Legislative Assembly, will not require entry permits and that Aboriginal communities may authorise the entry of other persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Keeffe  and I religiously stuck to our duties to bring about a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory and to give it certain powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is now a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body and now has certain powers because of the actions of the Whitlam Labor Government, not because of the actions of a previous Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having been a member of the committee which came down with the recommendation that the Northern Territory be given a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly, I think that I am entitled to stand up for the Whitlam Government and say what it did in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of common knowledge in this town, this little closed community where nothing is secret for very long, that people such as  Mr Jim  Malone, the head of FACTSFACTS’ is a curious title for an outfit that has little to do with truth- which is the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, and a man named Des Foster, who is the head of an organisation called FARB, which is the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, and  Mr Kerry  Packer, who probably does not need to be designated, have been in and out of the corridors of power in the last few weeks, whereas people demonstrating on behalf of the ABC and on behalf of the survival of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner of the ABC such as Marius Webb have to take their place out on the lawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of paragraph (b) of proposed sub-section 31(1), add ‘, of whom one shall be the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our position, however, is that the ABC has a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But at the same time, it is not prepared to make the desirable, sensible, and perfectly acceptable provision for the appointment of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the staff to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that the amendment to provide for a representative to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the staff to serve on the Commission is probably the most important amendment the Opposition has moved to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a most important step for the Northern Territory, following as it does the decision of the Labor Government to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and to arrange for the transfer of powers to give the people of the Northern Territory greater involvement in the decision-making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were <span class="highlight">elected</span> on an expectation, which was shared by not only members of the Australian Labor Government but also people throughout the world, that the current prosperity of the Western capitalist world was going to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But at least it seemed that one could understand what the Government was saying when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Malcolm  Fraser in his policy statement prior to the election referred to the employment creating incentives of his Government’s policy when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why was not  Mr Fraser  honest enough to tell us that before he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that the State will be regarded as one division and the members, to the number as determined, will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for that one division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those regional councils, established in States where neither the State or local government <span class="highlight">elected</span> members have any experience or interest in the welfare needs of the people, were very apprehensive about the likelihood of their State governments wanting to take up where the Commonwealth had left off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate is a continuing body with Senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> for sue year terms and it cannot be dissolved except in the event of a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other deficiency relates to persons who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as Senators, but who have died, resigned or become disqualified before the commencement of their terms of service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that event the person chosen by the State Parliament is to hold office until the expiration of the term of the  Senator who  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this Convention affirms the principle that a casual vacancy in the Senate which occurs by reason of the death of a senator or the disqualification or resignation of a senator caused by bona fide illness or incapacity should, in order to maintain the principle of proportional representation and the wishes of the people of the State at the relevant Senate election, be filled by a member of the same political party as the senator whose vacancy is to be filled but in reaffirming this principle the Convention recommends that the Constitution be amended to provide that the person <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Houses of Parliament of the State should hold office for the balance of the term of the senator whose place he is taking. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That appointment is a salutary reminder of the emptiness of the slogan ‘there will be no more jobs for the boys after we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office’, which was, of course, a slogan used in the election campaign of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that this Government has designed deliberately a situation in which, if it and the present Prime Minister lose office and a Labor government is <span class="highlight">elected</span>, this Government is binding that Labor government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be more to the advantage of government and the Public Service if the problem of the permanency of First Division officers were to be met in this way: A First Division officer- a head of a department; a Secretary of a department- ought not to consider himself <span class="highlight">elected</span> in perpetuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a disadvantage to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the country in that, if a head of a department is not in its opinion capable of carrying out its policy or in some way frustrates its policy, he should be able to be retrenched in some way; it should not be necessary to appoint him to a senior position overseas in the ambassadorial service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested once that Second Division public servants should represent a pool from which First Division officers should be appointed for the term of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this measure arises out of certain circumstances which occurred in appointments made to the First Division by the former Labor Government, As a result, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the then Leader of the Opposition, announced that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> our parties would take certain measures to correct the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, when the representatives of the news media of whatever form, whether it was radio, television, the mass circulation journals or the so-called newspapers of opinion, have telephoned me, as they did last week, on every occasion I replied that my views would be expressed in the place where I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to express them, that is, in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas the United Nations, in apparent illegality has imposed many restrictions and sanctions upon Rhodesia which has been remarkably free from the bloodshed and turmoil of the other aforementioned lands, even to the extent now of actively encouraging armed conflict against the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Rhodesian government, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have pointed out, the people have to come to King William Street to see their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As soon as those representatives are <span class="highlight">elected</span> they domicile themselves in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same thing applies to some of the South Australian Liberal senators, who were living in the country when they were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that in the first national Parliament South Australia and Tasmania <span class="highlight">elected</span> their members under the system of using the whole State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, only 5 members from each State were to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would expect that at least 150 candidates would be standing for election in New South Wales from which 44 or 45 would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could we ever operate under a system whereby 45 members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by using a State as one electorate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the point that  Senator Cavanagh  just raised, that is, that if the same sort of system were used as the one that is used to elect senators to this chamber there would be a system in New South Wales under which somebody could be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives with under 3 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider the length of time it took the Commonwealth Electoral Office to determine who the senators were for New South Wales after the last double dissolution we see that it is not possible for the Electoral Office to determine within 60 days who the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members for New South Wales are to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within 60 days it is not humanly possible to determine who the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives for New South Wales are to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Governments that win office on gerrymandered boundaries cannot be said to be really democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, when the results were announced and the members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> for that State, I presume that all of them would receive the higher electorate allowance because their electorate- the whole State- would be more than 5000 square kilometres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though senators do not receive that allowance at this stage, I assume it would happen under an election at large when the members of the House of Representatives would all be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for an electorate larger than 5000 square kilometres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Each candidate <span class="highlight">elected</span> needed nearly 92 000 primary votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party of Australia got approximately 42 per cent of the vote and sixty-eight of its members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives on a basis of 47 000 votes per member <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Country Party, with a little over 1 1 per cent of the votes, had 23 members <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives on an average of 37 000 votes for each candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this meant, for example, an infinitesimal quota for election being set in New South Wales some odd people who might mean well in support of a particular cause might be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the High Court’s decision, if we did not carry out a proper redistribution when a State has a change in the number of members it is entitled to there would have to be an election at large- an election whereby all the members for that State would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in one large ballot- which would be a sort of monstrous three times over Senate-type poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from when the Democratic Labor Party was represented in this chamber, I have never heard anybody in this Parliament argue that the House of Representatives ought to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on other than single member electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I do put to the Senate is that I believe, and I am sure most of us believe, that those who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives should, as far as is humanly possible, represent the will of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know what happened in 1970 when, at a loss to the major parties of both sides of this Parliament, small parties and independents and people with rather exotic eccentric ideas on one particular subject- abolition of death duties was the feature of one platformwere <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to you that, in fact, it is curious, when members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place to deal with all the matters involved such as the economy and the state of the nation, to find a candidate <span class="highlight">elected</span> who has committed himself on only one issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take up a point that  Senator Missen  made last night, namely, that in half elections partaking of the character of by-elections all sorts of eccentrics, which was the kind word he used, are encouraged to run and people who represent nothing but some partial aspiration which happens to catch the mood of the electorate at that time are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing foreseen by those who gave so much thought to this Constitution which some people would dismantle almost with the levity with which they would smoke a pipe, was that we had to have a powerful Senate- a Senate which Quick and Garran writing at the time said was unquestionably the most important and one of the most conspicuous of all of the Federal features of the Constitution- because if the House of Representatives were <span class="highlight">elected</span> with numbers proportionate to the people, the great metropolitan States of Victoria and New South Wales would have a commanding domination of the Parliament unless the Senate showed an independence in its spirit to protect the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a senator is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber, according to the provisions of the Constitution as at present the term of that senator is 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our system we have a people’s house <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people and I think it is an essential requirement of democracy but it can be turned out of office, sacked at will every 6 months by a State appointed house in this smaller chamber, the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a knowledgeable man suggesting that if we are to have only one House we should do away with the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a simultaneous election and received almost twice the quota; so I do not mind in the slightest having simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a union tried to extend the current term of office of officials who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> the industrial registrar would reject the proposal under regulation 115 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations on the ground that it was unreasonable, oppressive and unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, now the Government is attempting to change the ground rules, is attempting to give to members of this Senate an extra six or eight months in the Senate for which they were not <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments in Australia already have the shortest term of office of governments in any western democracy as they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 3 years only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I feel that in 1 977 in Australia the Australian people should be given the opportunity to pass judgment on this question, particularly as it was supported by such a wide spectrum of responsible <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the 3 tiers of government at the Hobart Convention in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The party I represent has been consistent in saying that it will support this type of legislation so that the House of Representatives and the Senate will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the Government has now introduced a Bill to provide for a referendum to alter the Constitution so that the House of Representatives and the Senate can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same date, not because of the principle involved but because of political expediency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not conducive to sound Government that the future of a recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government should depend upon the eventualities of elections for senators which take place during the normal life of the House of Representatives … <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that government had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 6 months, a guiltless Senate would be dragged out to go to the people merely because the members of the House of Representatives could not agree amongst themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not agree with the former Prime Minister  (Mr E. G.

    <p>I would be surprised,  Senator, if  you could go round Tasmania and convince people in the trade union movement- you did pretty well in the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions- that the trade union movement can look to its <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to get unfettered progress of industrial legislation and at the present time fight an interim Senate election where a lot of what we want can be vetoed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frustrating and exasperating though it often is, its value lies primarily in its being an effective brake to the legislative ambitions of the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Chamber, in New South Wales the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the years we have heard from his side of the chamber of divisions in the Australian Labor Party, but never have there been divisions in the Labor Party such as we are witnessing in this chamber this week between 1 1 honourable senators opposite and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for the Prime Minister, who is the <span class="highlight">elected</span> nominee of the majority from Sydney and Melbourne, to advise the Governor-General that an election is required and to send half this Senate to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the danger to this Senate is that the Prime Minister, who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> substantially by votes from Sydney and Melbourne, will have power to dissolve half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was some discussion in the course of the debate about situations which arose in which honourable senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> anything up to 5 years previously acted to effectively obstruct or dismiss the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason they were able to force the properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government to the people, and they will still have the right to do that if this amendment is carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Hall touched on the fact that many people, almost all of them on the conservative side I think, who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Senate appear to acquire delusions of grandeur about the Senate’s importance and their importance as senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be forgotten that the purpose of the proposals that are to go to the people is to change the ground rules upon which members of this Senate are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and upon which their terms of office are established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part of the amendment, which is likewise most valuable and originates from the Constitutional Convention last year, is the provision that the person appointed to fill a vacancy shall not just fill it until the next election, when he may be thrown out and proportional representation would no longer apply in the State he represented, he will in fact now serve the balance of the term of the person who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> originally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, with proportional representation, I believe there can be no doubt that this House is the most democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Parliament in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are prepared to see the labour force represented in the Parliament, but they are not prepared to let a Labor government- a properly and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor governmentexercise power in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that was a fair tactic because I remember that when we came into government in November 1972 and I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Ministry I blamed the previous Government for creating the difficulties that we had to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, five or six months after this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office there was a change of government in New South Wales where a Labor government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If those agreements had been kept the projects would nave proceeded more quickly and the slowing down which has occurred since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> would not have happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has a comprehensive program which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to pursue in 1975 and which it is midway through implementing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the other part of the question is concerned, I emphasise that the policy on which the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1975 remains the policy of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, casting back to 1975, we recall that the caretaker government came into power because it would not allow a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to go for its full 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three years later, at the early age of 29, he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate as a senator representing New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A year after he left the Senate in 1962 he was appointed  Chairman  of the Sydney County Council and he occupied that important position until 1965- some 2 years, when he achieved one of his lifelong ambitions to be democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Sydney as its Lord Mayor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately because of a set of circumstances- this could be related to education among other matters- many people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber perhaps are unable to collate and put forward an argument that would satisfy the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to draw some attention to the various alibis which this Government has adopted since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the failure of its election promises and the failure of its economic management, but before I do I shall contrast some of the failures with the promises that were made in 1975- the promise to restore business confidence, the promise to reduce inflation and the promise to slash unemployment by 200 000 people if this Government were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator believes that it would be a good thing to have the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> at an election at large instead of by single member constituencies let him say so, but I think there is a general desire, certainly by members of that place, for the single constituency member to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On further reflection, because this Government decided as soon as it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> not to reconstitute that committee and because I believe the topic is far too important to be given the slightest possibility of being sidestepped, I have amended my original motion to provide that the inquiry be carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take it that in his continuous 1 6 months attack on federalism and on the system of federalism- despite the unanimity of the Premiers- what he is saying to the Senate is that the Labor Party not only rejects the policy of federalism but also, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power, would return to the tax reimbursement uniform taxation that it in fact had in government, that it rejects tax sharing and that it favours tax reimbursement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He seemed to accuse me of flitting from committee to committee and implied that that was not good enough; that I ought to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to one committee, do my job on that committee, and then perhaps raise other matters in the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say this,  Mr President:  The Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to look after the whole of the Australian electorate and it has a duty to look after all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I hope that no honourable senator will ever claim that he is being personally inconvenienced because the House of Parliament to which he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> has to sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is contrary to the principles on which we are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will remember at the last meeting of the Joint House Committee prior to the Parliament’s rising for the winter recess that the Committee was told by the  Speaker  of the other place that the nominated and <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of that Committee had no jurisdiction or authority whatever to make any decision as members of that duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> or appointed Committee and that the sole responsibility for any decision taken by the House Committee rested within the province of the two Presiding Officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want you to clarify for the Senate- I do not expect you to do so tonight; I want you to give it some thought- the duties and the responsibilities of the persons who are nominated in each chamber and are duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that if that is correct the members of the Joint House Committee over the many years it has been in operation have been wasting not only their own time but also the time of the persons who have nominated them in their various party rooms and have brought the nominations into this chamber and into the other place so that the members could be duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the case is the reverse of what  Mr Speaker  has said I think the time has come for the Joint House Committee to be put on a proper basis so that the members who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to it know where,they are going and what their responsibilities, are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Parliament was not prepared to sit upon the request of the Executive when it says that it needs specific power, the Parliament would be wanting and not discharging those functions that the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> it to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This device which has been developed over the last decade or so whereby a whole enterprise can be held to ransom by a selected section of key personnel going out or refusing to do work necessitates that we consider disruption by key personnel as being of special significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Parliament, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, appoints Ministers to administer departments and services, and if the servants engaged to discharge the duties of transmitting the post or carrying on the airways or the railways or shipping or communication services refuse to carry out their jobs according to current awards and laws, how shameful it would be for an Executive to flinch from the duty of requiring that the services should be performed, by putting aside the people who refuse to do it- nothing else; suspending those who engage in the industrial action; and if they persist in paralysing the enterprise, standing down, so that the country will not be under the burden of paying useless salaries, the great majority whose work has been rendered impossible by the striking minority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found, for instance, during my time on the Committee that there seemed to be- I do not know whether or not this is a correct assumption on my part- a very large body of local opinion which was not in favour of the transfer of functions to a locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are others, of course, such as students of democracy and the development of political systems, who believe that communities ought to be involved and ought to have a responsiblity for the running of their own affairs even if, in fact, that has to be brought about compulsorily, as would be the situation with an <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly carrying out municipal and state type functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose there is a tendency to make laws on a purist sort of basis without the sort of regard for the finer feelings of people in a community that you get with a locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> institution running the community’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Wriedt)  has said, the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975 on three specific undertakings which were spelt out in clear terms: To restore prosperity; to defeat inflation; and to provide jobs for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authority would comprise members <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a specific period and would have powers which reflected the wishes of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Press release stated:   the broad details of Australia ‘s Cocos policy were:  a representative form of local government for the Cocos community to be established with the ultimate aim being creation of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were told by Government spokesmen when the Government was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> that it was necessary to improve profits so that unemployment would decrease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: ‘Unemployment will be slashed by 200,000 if a Liberal-Country Party government is <span class="highlight">elected</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Government’s policies- those policies on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975- were designed to tackle the root causes of the economic problems of the community and the unemployment in the community, the root causes being inflation and the high levels of wage rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be remembered that this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the most extraordinary circumstances in 1975 on an undertaking that it would bring down inflation, reduce unemployment, stimulate business and get the economy going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on an undertaking that it would stay in office for three years in order to carry out the policies that were so essential after the three years of office of the Labor Government that this Government did so much to disrupt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Walsh  has pointed out tonight, the present Leader of the Government is on record in the Senate  Hansard  as saying on more than one occasion that immediately after the election of 1972 he and others in the Liberal Party set about destroying the Labor Government despite the fact that the Labor Party had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a majority of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Hall  has pointed out, the Liberal Party, running true to form, although it could not be in government itself, was going to prevent the properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government from governing the way the people wanted it to govern, and so much so that we were forced to go to the people again in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party was going to lose the numbers in this place after being democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>, a person in Queensland went to the depths of despair because he did not want a Labor government in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So he used all the dirty tricks he could think of in an endeavour- and he was successful- to prevent the Labor Government which had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a second occasion in May 1974 from carrying out the policy which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when we look back in history we see that, although the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on two occasions within three years to carry out a policy with which the people agreed, we were not allowed to carry it out because the Liberals had the numbers in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Hall  has rightly pointed out- it now looks almost certain because of the way the present Government has got the country into an economic mess, with rising unemployment which is the worst since the last Depression- even if  Mr Fraser  holds an election in December and is the loser he will still ride roughshod over the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government because he will have the numbers in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By going to the people early, not only would he extend his government’s term of office by two years, if re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the first place for a term of six years but, because of the unsatisfactory way in which this Senate operates, I had to face two more elections even before my first six-year term finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was not saying that if the coalition parties were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government things would get worse, but that is the very thing that happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Small businesses and their association are on record as saying that since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> 12,000 small businesses a year are going to the wall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We intend to do exactly that when next we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate election I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by only a very narrow margin and perhaps I could say that that was because of the 200,000-odd people in those North Shore safe Liberal electorates who voted for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The broad details of Australia’s Cocos policy are as follows: a representative form of local government for the Cocos community to be established with the ultimate aim being the creation of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body; arrangements to be made allowing a transfer to the Cocos community of the village area ofHome Island; the replacement of token money by Australian currency; establishment of a new form of fund to assist the financing of community activities’, there should be freedom of movement and communication within the Territory; the improvement of education and health facilities and general upgrading of living standards; the framing and implementation of laws which could be clearly applied and enforced, taking into account local institutions and customs; the progressive introduction of a wages economy appropriate to Cocos conditions; appropriate means by which Australian citizenship can be provided to residents of the Territory who wish to take up Australian citizenship; the provision of financial assistance to Cocos Malays who wish to move from Cocos to Australia; and the ownership by the Australian Government of all land on which its facilities are located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in 1975- almost two years ago- it was given an overwhelming mandate to reduce inflation, to reduce unemployment and to bring about stability in the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation which we have at the moment, and which it seems we may have indefinitely, is that there is only one tier of government in the Australian Capital Territory and people in the Territory find that many decisions affecting their lives in the most basic ways are taken not by their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives but by one person- the Minister for the Capital Territory, who of course is not answerable or accountable in any way to the residents of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is high time in this country that the shop stewards were made to realise that they are not the Government of this country but that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government is the government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet  Senator Young,  and he is joined by even  Mr Fraser  and other leaders of his Party, says there is too much power in the hands of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> trade union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is,  most importantly, an indication that the Government intends to work in a spirit of amicable co-operation with the people of the Territory and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the task of giving birth to Australia ‘s seventh State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1947 the Legislative Council was established, with six <span class="highlight">elected</span> and seven official members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These were people with a wealth of background, able to come in and assist the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1968, a greater step forward occurred when 1 1 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members and six official members made up the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, in 1974, thanks to the efforts of the Australian Labor Party, we had a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was  Mr Fraser  himself who said when he was undermining confidence in the then Liberal Party leader,  Mr Snedden,  that a government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> for three years and that it was entitled to serve its three-year term in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Might I say that for the 23 years before the Whitlam Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people in 1972 this nation had been held in harness with reins tight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975, Australia was in a state of severe depression marked by rapid inflation, rapidly rising unemployment, and declining output. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a parliament <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the majority, but the fact that it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the majority does not mean that the minority- those people who live in our rural areas- should be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By not rejecting but by deferring a Bill until such time as the people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> government submitted itself to the people was a complete distortion and betrayal of the Senate ‘s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright’s  desire to reform the conference role of the two Houses for the purpose of deciding on an allocation of money does not get over the fact that the Senate has rejected the peoples’ <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time we found that the Senate had the power to dismiss the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the people and that is a power which the people never thought this Chamber possessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, after all, the idea of having an election is to make certain that the right government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> and not to make things easier for anybody in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the new averaging arrangements applicable under the new personal tax system will, for 1978-79 and subsequent years, always be of benefit to primary producers, the Bill also provides that all primary producers, including those who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to withdraw from the averaging system, will automatically have averaging applied for those years when it is to their advantage for that to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My remarks were directed to the denigration of this chamber which results from its ability to defeat a government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, as was demonstrated and put into operation in November and December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not as bad for the members, about whom I spoke earlier, who never go outside the metropolitan area, particularly those members in South Australia, many of whom were <span class="highlight">elected</span> when they lived in the country and soon shifted to Adelaide and became domiciled in the metropolitan area with an office in the metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that in Mount Isa yesterday the Premier of Queensland,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  stated publicly that if the National Party candidate was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> State and Commonwealth government funds for the Lake Julius water scheme would not be provided? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When those people <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Government they found that that Government was sacked at a moment’s notice at the behest of the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly the Government which twice has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people is able to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He claims he was one of the architects of the various steps taken to obtain the dismissal of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Premier inferred that any member for Mount Isa who was not a National Party member would be denied his right to make representation to the State Government on behalf of the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office because people think that we are responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rather interested in the honourable senator’s view that if a Labor government were <span class="highlight">elected</span>- God forbid- it would have learned from its mistakes and it would not be the same sort of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt that is what would happen if the Labor Party were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government on 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, no doubt by the strength of its criticism of this principle, the Labor Party is indicating quite clearly that if it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government it will not continue to maintain 20 per cent per capita grants without means test in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The effect is to enhance these provisions in respect of certain late entrant officers who <span class="highlight">elected</span> to limit their contributions to the old DFRB scheme, with a consequential reduction in benefit expectation, but who, because of the conversion arrangements from the old to the new scheme, were placed in a disproportionately worse position visavis others transferred to the new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although a statement was made in the LiberalNational Country parties policy speech put down on 25 November 1975 that a high priority would be placed on this matter,  Senator Webster  said that the Minister for Primary Industry had advised him that early in 1976, just a few months after this Government had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, the Liberal and National Country parties did not propose to proceed with the animal health laboratory at Geelong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the Tories of this place it may seem like par for the course and in the natural order of things that a GovernorGeneral would dismiss an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor government and put them in its place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then we came to about the late 1930s- the beginning of the Second World War- when we were fortunate enough to have Thomas Playford <span class="highlight">elected</span> as Premier of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government, supported by Robin Millhouse, who is now leader of the Australian Democrats in South Australia, argued that the Liberal Movement of which  Senator Steele  Hall was a member when he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate no longer existed and that it had been taken over by the Australian Democrats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government took the attitude that in accordance with the wish expressed in the change to the Constitution it should appoint someone close to the feeling of the electors at the time they <span class="highlight">elected</span> the senator who had retired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Hall was <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a three+year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the referendum proposal was not to fill a vacancy with someone who expressed the opinion of the electors at the time they <span class="highlight">elected</span> the person who retired and created the vacancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a suggestion that the appointment by the State Government should have been held over until after the Federal elections so that if the fate of  Senator Steele  Hall was what it in fact proved to be he could be re-appointed for the six-month term as nearly expressing the opinion of the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows that at the time  Senator Steele  Hall was originally <span class="highlight">elected</span> he had different beliefs, different politics and made different utterances than he had and made when he stood at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He no longer represented the party for which he was originally <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be careful in our interpretation of the wish of the people expressed in the constitutional referendum that we keep the numbers of the party for which the electorate originally voted so as not to give an advantage to another party which was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could have <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Labor Party member but to give the Premier his due his justification for the appointment was that he thought he was better expressing the wish of the electors at the time and the referendum decision to change the Constitution by putting someone from the Australian Democrats into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> for another 3 years on its pledge that it will continue to do what it has done over the past 2 years, that is, to reduce government expenditure and tighten the belts of everyone in order to reduce inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that body and therefore I think it is highly desirable that we should ratify the Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Government in the Senate is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by Senators- he is appointed by the leader of the Executive, by the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as this will not happen, as  Senator Rae  and his ilk are firmly committed to the concept of a Senate which can at any time throw out the lower House even though the Senate cannot in any way be considered representative of the people in the same way as the other House is and even though many members of that Senate will have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> many years before the election of whatever government is in office, I believe the Senate will remain the rubber stamp it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was one who believed after the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government was sacked in 1975 and convincingly defeated at the polls that the majority of Australians agreed with Kerr’s actions; but at least 40 per cent violently disagreed with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would have believed that so cynical a deal, and so dishonest a deal, could have been set up- a job in exchange for sacking an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, for calling an unjustifiable early election and then retiring in time for the electorate to forget about the shame of 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it would be possible by offering various taxation and other incentives to corporations involved in the media to encourage the establishment within the structure of each newspaper of an editorial board of the professional journalists working for the newspaper <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the reporting staff of that paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have, as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, a special responsibility to ensure that they see that what we do is relevant to them; that we are representing them and are working for the good of our country in the way that we see best, whatever our political philosophy or affiliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raised with him- I think it was one of those occasions when he was ducking and weaving on the ropes- the subject of the way in which  Mr Justice  Smithers was able to obtain information about the calibre of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation operatives and their recruitmenttheir immaturity was under consideration in this case- that had been denied to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the former Governor-General deceived not only the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government but also his friends in the Labor movement, one can understand why from time to time very strongly voiced views are expressed by those members of Parliament who are rightly aggrieved about the actions of the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There  can be no question of the manoeuvres that took place, manoeuvres which created an impossible situation, in which the Governor-General was forced into wrongly making a decision which dismissed the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day and appointed another - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bill Wood has, on a number of occasions, decided to do that which we and most Australians consider to be in the best tradition of citizenship in this country, that is to seek an endorsement to stand for Parliament and perhaps to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect,  Mr President,  I think that that comes within your scope because you are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that senators who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of their States are given adequate participation in the business of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Territory has been subjected to a number of extraordinarily harsh policies with respect to employment, funding, rates charges, rents on government accommodation, and so forth, and none of those measures has come about as a result of a decision of the locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter what the people of the Territory felt, no matter what they asked their <span class="highlight">elected</span> members to do within the Legislative Council, no matter how they acted, the Federal Government was in a situation in which its seven nominees could veto any action taken on behalf of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So this further constitutional change to a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> council occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, this took a little while because although the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly became a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body, it was given no teeth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it enacted the amendment to the Northern Territory Administration Act that created a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> council, it did not pursue the recommendations of the joint committee, which would have transferred to the Territory more executive responsibility and allowed it more say in its own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place by the people of our various States, and the minute we start taking away the rights of individual senators this institution will start to disintegrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are able to travel about the Parliament to see their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The real desire of people to whom one talks is not to have a military guard between them and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like most members of the public, I assumed when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> that there was some sort of security and that so long as I was in this building I was reasonably secure at any time of the day or night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a small indication of the good relations that exist between the general community and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives who sit in parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to do when looking at our privileges as members of Parliament is simply to ensure that we retain the freedom to carry out our duties as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are the officers <span class="highlight">elected</span> by us for the purpose of ensuring proper control and management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are run by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> officers of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had occasion, particularly after I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the executive of my Party as a shadow Minister, to have discussions with a wide ranging group of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of parliament should insist that they be put in a category different from that of other people who use this building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no reason in my mind why we as <span class="highlight">elected</span> members should not have to follow the same processes as everyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that we will see a gradual development of a better system of security in this Parliament not only for those who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and serve in the chambers but also for those several thousand people who work in the Parliament or who visit the building regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been said that members of Parliament, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, accept the risk of being public figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always understood that an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of Parliament is entitled to enter this place at any hour of the day or night, any day of the week, and that nobody could impede his progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many words have been spoken during this debate on the protection of the people who occupy the Parliament, whether they be <span class="highlight">elected</span> members or the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be interested to hear the Minister say how he will ensure that every taxi or hire car driver who transports us to and from this place, particularly late at night, can be trusted and whether they are going to have their photographs taken and put on an identity card so that each and every personnot only the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members but also the staff- can identify the driver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mere presence of members of Parliament in this building is apt to attract to it, as a chief focal point, those who are minded to use violence or terrorism as a means of expressing their will against <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For God’s sake please let us remember that we are trustees of the public money and that if internal security requirements can be reduced by reason of this system of external surveillance, let us remember that we would better represent the taxpayer by relieving him of the burden of the unnecessary expense involved in footling about with the imaginary idea that he is to be handicapped when he comes here on lawful occasions to see his <span class="highlight">elected</span> member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been told by a union official in Melbourne that a possible reason for the official trade union hostility is that on several occasions women associated with the centre have attempted to by-pass the <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials of unions and enter factories and work places in order to spread their propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may declare that the legislation applies to a reserve or community on request by a council established under the Queensland law or if he is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adults resident on the reserve or community wish it; an existing council established under Queensland law or a body declared to be a council for the purposes of the Act, will have the function of managing community affairs and the necessary powers to carry out that function; any declared body established under the regulations will be an <span class="highlight">elected</span> council or otherwise a properly incorporated body; councils will have power to make by-laws and to authorise entry to reserves; by express provision, councils and individual Aboriginals and Islanders will not be bound to obey directions given by officials under the Queensland legislation; councils will be responsible only to their communities; the Commonwealth may, if it becomes necessary in order to give effect to the purposes of the legislation, make available to councils land acquired by or otherwise vested in the Commonwealth; and in the case of acquisition, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act will apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to us that the Prime Minister has demonstrated to the Australian public and to the Aborigines the insincerity of the position in which he says he holds the Aborigines ‘own <span class="highlight">elected</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 18 November, 1975, the Aurukun people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> council, five in number, personally requested the Department to assume management of the Aurukun community, and after full discussion and a verbal approach to the Director on that day they then confirmed their request by presentation of a formal letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To support his argument  Senator Bonner  produced a Press statement from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader of the Queensland Aboriginal reserve residents,  Mr Fisher,  which stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is pitiful beyond expression that we white men, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the State field, on the one hand, and, with one exception- I refer to  Senator Bonner,  whose advent to this Parliament is a unique achievement; I have no need to flatter him because his abilities are self-evident- in the Federal Parliament of Australia, on the other hand, are exhibiting a contention between one another as to the proper reconciliation of the claims made by the Aboriginals to the two governments, State and Federal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very sad-it is a quite disturbing situation- to be in Australia in 1978 and find that people such as those at Aurukun and Mornington Island are disturbed and worried by the thought that their administration may be taken over by one of our State governments, a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Minister can be put in the same sort of situation on those occasions when he disagrees with the expressions of opinion made to him by the people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, which was an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">elected</span> body and which was truly representative of the Aboriginal people, now is only an Aboriginal council which has no greater powers than to appoint five members to a body to which the Minister also appoints five members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, there were changes in Queensland legislation which did not provide for an <span class="highlight">elected</span> council but provided for an appointed council, the Minister, if the amendments were to take effect, would be required, by way of a mandatory act, to do what a council asked him to do irrespective of the fact that the council was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> but was appointed and may not reflect the wishes of the majority of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe, if there is to be any genuine act of self-determination, the powers of the council which has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> or appointed under this legislation must extend over all of the reserve land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not pretend to have an ability in the nautical sphere, like the two previous speakers,  Senator Wriedt  and  Senator Wright  but I have had a considerable interest in this topic since I first was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament and in fact before then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the first place, there is no official trade union hostility to the Working Women’s Centre and, secondly,  Senator Harradine  gives no information of those instances when the Centre has bypassed the <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick, in the web of fantasy which he has spun around himself on this issue, would have us believe that the State governments entered, in the financial sense, a golden age when the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and when the fiscal policies of new federalism became partially operative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that sense the Minister for Local Government has the right- as such Ministers have in other States- to dismiss <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me to be patently absurd if we have a situation in which a member of the academic staff of an academic institution who is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of the council is precluded by a provision such as this from being present and participating in any discussion about matters such as housing, superannuation or any other matter which can come before a council for proper consideration, deliberation and decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That might be understood by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  to be already a recognition by some <span class="highlight">elected</span> parliaments that they have to go cap in hand to the union to obtain the services that the people require to be supplied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister recall that the Minister for Primary Industry stated in a Press release dated 5 July 1977 that an interim beef producers consultative group nominated by producer organisations was to be set up to enable the October 1977 target date for the formation of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to be met, but that arrangements would be made for an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group to succeed the interim body by March 1978? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the Minister last month wrote to producer group leaders saying that those elections should now be delayed and reviewed at the end of 1978 on the grounds, firstly, that the cost involved was $250,000; secondly, that not all producer organisations supported the concept of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group; and, thirdly, that the Stage 1 report on amalgamation of producer groups called for the establishment of a federal cattle council to provide the membership of the producer consultative group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Government prepared to meet the cost of these elections when the Minister promised an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the Government was aware at the time it promised an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group and set up the interim group that the proposal did not have unanimous support of producer groups but nevertheless had strong majority support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The governments of Australia, Commonwealth and State, have between them complete power to decide how any land, any project or any aspect of the environment shall be managed for the future, so if this project is developed complete control over it lies with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have an answer from the Minister for Primary Industry as follows: It is true that a decision was taken in mid 1977 to make arrangements for an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Producer Consultative Group to be established under the provisions of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention was to replace this interim body with an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Producer Consultative Group by March of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to serve in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the aspects of the negotiations which led to the acceptance of that Bill by a number of members of the Government was, importantly, statements of acceptance by the Government of the principle of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group which reflected a very strong feeling amongst many meat producers that that consultative group to the AMLC must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement dated 5 July 1977 to which I referred last week he promised that an interim beef producers consultative group to be nominated by producer organisations would be set up to enable the October 1 977 target date for the formation of the AMLC to be met, but that arrangements would be made for an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group to succeed the interim body by March 1978- that is, a body <span class="highlight">elected</span> by all the beef producers in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis many producers who had some misgivings about the Bill accepted it and they have looked forward to the opportunity of having an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative producer consultative group to express their point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I returned to this place and pursued my inquiries in relation to it- because I was quite unaware of it- I found that no public announcement had been made by the Minister but that he had written to the leaders of certain producer groups in April indicating that the Government believed on certain grounds that the previous decision for a producer <span class="highlight">elected</span> consultative group should be delayed and reviewed at the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I indicated in my question that I was aware that not all producers or even all producer groups had supported the concept of a producer <span class="highlight">elected</span> consultative group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year producers made very clear the fact that they want this producer consultative group to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year organisations accepted appointment to the interim producer consultative group only on the grounds that it was an interim group and that it would be followed by a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By 13 April we should have had a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group which should have established a relationship with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What particularly concerns me is that judging by the Minister’s statement today it is as clear as it can be that the Government has changed its mind about the undertakings it gave last year concerning an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister indicated in his statement the intention to replace the interim body by an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producer consultative group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  have stated that the reserve lands as such should be handed to the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island on lease with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils as the trustees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I first came to this chamber in 1974 I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must never reach the stage where we, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the chamber, are spokesmen for the Government as distinct from spokesmen for the people, to refer to a phrase used by  Sir Winston  Churchill when he opened the first Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What ought to be said is that, following a great deal of consultation, much of which has been discussed previously in the Senate, an agreement was reached on 1 1 April which ensures that the Aboriginal people of the two reserves can now manage their own affairs under the framework of the Queensland local government system, initially through their existing councils and then through local councils <span class="highlight">elected</span> under local government legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the position with regard to the policy of the Government on land rights for Aborigines and to state that policy in any other way overlooks completely not only the policy which has been clearly stated but also the actions which have been taken by the Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in December 1975, it was abundantly clear that one of the challenges of management of the economy in difficult conditions was to arrest the rapidly spiralling costs of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One State parliamentarian from Victoria was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place after retiring from the Victorian Parliament with $2 1 1 ,000- the ex- Leader of the Labor Opposition in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This brings me to the question of the position of the staff-<span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner of the ABC which is currently held by Marius Webb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of this debate I seek an assurance from the Minister that the Government intends, at the termination of  Mr Webb’s  period of appointment, to continue with the principle established during the period of the Labor Government of having one commissioner, out of the total of II, <span class="highlight">elected</span> by staff members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly think that the principle of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner should be embodied in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a necessity for a little consideration to be given, even to some of the principles for an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Constitutional Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that Bills have been introduced as far back as 1921 to give consideration to an <span class="highlight">elected</span> convention to consider the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The executives were <span class="highlight">elected</span>, not for the purpose of considering the Constitution, but to run the day-to-day government of their States or the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion but, like  Senator Rae,  I strongly advocate that we should be leading on to a popular convention, one <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying - I am agreeing strongly with  Senator Rae-  that a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> convention would bring a great deal more knowledge of and concern for constitutional change to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that if we moved now to an <span class="highlight">elected</span> convention where people had to choose delegates and had to think whether those people would be the most suitable persons to be delegates at a convention for the purpose of looking at a constitutional change, I believe we would have a better understanding of the proposals that are put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, we are in agreement upon the essential importance of the Senate of constitutional change and on the need for greater knowledge and deep understanding of it, and on the need for a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, on 30 November 1977 one of the four major groups, one which I might add previously favoured an <span class="highlight">elected</span> rather than a nominated group, wrote to the Minister for Primary Industry seeking substantive changes to the PCG electoral procedures he had announced in July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has taken no decision on whether PCG membership should be other than <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although not all organisations have responded formally, indications are that organisations representing the vast majority of relevant primary producers have now taken a position against an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Producers Consultative Group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can remember well that before I became a member of the Senate promises were made by the then caretaker Government that if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> it would cure the ills of Australia’s economy and would create conditions in which there would be full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, that Bill provides, firstly, that the Council of the University shall not authorise a students representative council to expend moneys raised by the University for the provision of amenities or services unless the governing body of that Council is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by students in an election at which not less than one quarter of the students entitled to vote have voted; secondly, that the Council of the University is to have a duty to ensure that any moneys it makes available to a student organisation for the provision of amenities and services are applied bona fide to the provision of amenities and services of direct benefit to the University; thirdly, that the Council is to have published and freely available to students at least twice a year an audited statement as to the amount of fees paid by students for amenities or services that are not of an academic nature, the organisations to which any part of these moneys have been paid and the purposes for which they have been expended; and fourthly, a provision that no person shall be required to be a member of any body or organisation in order to entitle him to be admitted as a student or to graduate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the States have <span class="highlight">elected</span>- this is the important thing- to cut taxes rather than to increase programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable senators to consider how she and thousands of other small farmers in this country look upon a government that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with such a magnificent majority which took the occasion yesterday to bring in a Bill to give its members additional benefits, and which took into account for the eligibility of those benefits all past service as Ministers, repaying anything that has been returned to them and paying their contribution of 1 1 1/2 per cent of salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of a senator who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for six years and at the expiration of 3 years after the commencement of his term of office he has ceased to be a senator for any reason- ‘for any reason’ are the words that have been left out- then he shall be deemed to have been retired or to have failed to secure a renewal of office and he shall qualify under this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to be reasonable that a person who retired on the grounds of ill-health may, if he were permitted to commute his entitlement, have a benefit immediately whereas a person who had a long period of service after his retirement and who had <span class="highlight">elected</span> to commute would perhaps have a lesser benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they can divorce themselves from the passing piece of rhetoric and emotionalism, they will find that not only does this matter of public importance have no substance to it, but that in fact the Government which they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> twice in the last  2lA  years with resounding majorities is in fact taking this country along a sound and tough course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was far too short because of the obstruction by members of the present Government while in opposition, using their massive numbers to deny the people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> government the right to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the 1950’s and 1960’s a succession of reforms to that Council was introduced by Liberal-Country Party Governments, culminating, in 1968, with a majority of <span class="highlight">elected</span> over appointed members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that if a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people has been negligent in permitting a large loss of revenue to take place, then I am afraid that the people who will have to carry the can for that loss are the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> that government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fairness, I must say that the LiberalCountry Party played its part during the period between the setting up of the Council and the granting of the first fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned, and I think the general proposition would be accepted, <span class="highlight">elected</span> people should have the opportunity for their legislation to be dealt with effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the report of the Joint Committee, a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly was established in 1974, and over the next two years it participated in preparing for the changes we are now debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1947 the Commonwealth Government saw fit to form a legislative council in the Northern Territory consisting of 13 people- seven nominated official members from the Commonwealth Public Service and six <span class="highlight">elected</span> members representing the six electorates that were formed in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that a legislative council had been formed, it was a very sad day because the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory had very little say in the affairs of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No matter what the six <span class="highlight">elected</span> members said on behalf of the Northern Territory, the seven official members from the Commonwealth Public Service voted en bloc against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were then eight <span class="highlight">elected</span> members, six nominated members and three non-official members of the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not right that the people of the Territory should have had inflicted upon them a majority of nominated people and a minority of <span class="highlight">elected</span> people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The submission talked about a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative council and its responsibilities within the Northern Territory- responsibilities in areas such as health, mining, law enforcement, labour, secondary industries, urban and rural affairs, land courts, the Department of the AttorneyGeneral and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to refer to the committee which was set up to inquire into the question of whether the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly should be fully <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the history of the Northern Territory-  Senator Kilgariff  spoke at length about the great efforts made by people in the Northern Territory to bring about an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government for the Territory- we find that it was not until 1947 that there was even a governmental body in the Territory which represented the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it took the Whitlam Government to give them a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly, on which I shall elaborate a little later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing was said in the second reading speech that the Committee recommended that there should be a house of 1 9 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members and that the election of those members should be carried out by way of optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Gough Whitlam said in our policy speech of 1 972 that we would give the people of the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out earlier, those people could not do a thing until they got a Labor government in Canberra which gave them the right to have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that this was on 1 May- not even three months after the first meeting of Parliament after the Whitlam Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We came to office in December, the Parliament assembled in February and we received the message from the House of Representatives on 10 April- pretty quick work in setting up a committee to look at the question of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative assembly for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a couple of months of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office we set things in train to give to the people of the Northern Territory the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see in the  Hansard  report from which I have quoted- I do not intend to go over it again- that  Senator Webster  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one of the first matters the Committee will consider is the constitution as it stands and it will endeavour to bring down a recommendation to this Parliament that it should give the people of the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Three months after we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office he criticised us for not having done something for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not deny the people of the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was happy to sign my name to the report which recommended a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have often suspected that the reason the Labor Party polled so poorly in 1974 was that the people of the Territory took out their spite on the Labor Party because it gave them a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Committee were happy to recommend that the Legislative Assembly be fully <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I found it very difficult to follow whether or not he was saying it was a good thing that we had an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said in his speech that he thought the fact that the Legislative Assembly had been made a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body was the reason the Labor Party was decimated in the election that took place immediately after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to the Opposition that it is a travesty of democracy where the Administrator has power to veto or to override the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, that is, the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the clause remains unaltered the Bill becomes an insult to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Legislative Assembly and they become little more than advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can point out constitutional weaknesses, but in the final analysis, it is my contention and the thrust of our argument, he must take the advice of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the Northern Territory, in common with other citizens of our Federal Commonwealth, have the right- indeed the duty- to control their own affairs through a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No State has a right, purely through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly, to make laws and to decide that those laws will be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment submitted by the Opposition, through its spokesman  Senator Robertson  is designed to guard against that and to ensure that the people of the Northern Territory will be able to have their say through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There ought to be provision for the Executive Council to come together but what we are trying to do is take this responsibility away from the Administrator and give it to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is better to have the responsibility with the majority party; in other words, back with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is the prerogative of the senior officer of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> group, whether it is the Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary or the Majority Leader- whatever term is used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was terribly annoyed with the way in which the then Opposition behaved in this Parliament when we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern this country, because they put every obstacle in our way and prevented u.s from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, the industry is composed of many wool growers, large and small, but the members of the AWIC are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the wool growers themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also from those meetings delegates to the regional conventions were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From those conventions delegates were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the State councils where discussions took place as to whether individual States and organisations within those States would agree to the exporting of some merino rams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marketing was one of the great concerns of the industry, but nevertheless agreement was reached, and delegates from those State conventions were <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the two major organisationsthe Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 22 months after it had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> it did nothing but brought in this legislation and passed it in the week before the Parliament rose for the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of these Bills goes back to late 1975 when the Liberal Party, which was then in Opposition, advised during the general election campaign of that year that if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office it would introduce the new federalism policy and that that policy would mean that the States would be given the power to introduce a State income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last election campaign the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was challenged to say whether this legislation would be introduced if he were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no stage did they say that if their Government were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> it would bring in legislation to enable the States to introduce a State income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a complete repudiation of a promise given by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the 1 975 election campaign that the Liberal-National Country parties, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, would not interfere with Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  knowledge of procedures and his concern for fair play was recognised by his own party, which in 1972 <span class="highlight">elected</span> him as its  Chairman,  a post he occupied until only a few weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that you will continue to act in the way that you have acted over the past three years, to my knowledge, in providing the opportunity as required for independent senators and other senators who are not members of the major parties to express the viewpoints for which they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of their particular State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The list is larger and indicates just how willing the Prime Minister is to break promises on which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not for others to decide whether by our default or our permission- a default which allows elitist groups, whether in board rooms or in political cells to manipulate society- or a permission, or perhaps submission, which allows a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> bench of High Court justices to put parameters on our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this House does have a useful role to play in the legislative process, it does not lie in menacing or threatening a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government with the power of life or death based on some spurious conception of the Senate’s position as a defender of States’ rights or federalism or the more recently fashionable notion that it is a last resort defender of the national interest against the Huns and Visigoths of the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of concern to me not only that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has brought himself into disrepute by this complete about-face from that which he promised and that to which he committed himself in 1977 but, also, to me as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative ofthe people, that this sort of about turn, this breaking of promises, calls into disrepute the whole of our Parliament and the whole of our parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can the citizens of Australia be expected to have confidence in and to trust their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives when we have performances of this kind from the Prime Minister and his Cabinet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate House Committee, which is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body of this Parliament, was completely ignored over this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a very important matter like this which has hit the headlines in every daily newspaper and which has been on the national news, yet the Senate House Committee, which is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body of the Parliament, was completely ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That budgetary policy has been designed to further the campaign of the Government, which it has followed since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, to fight inflation and significantly to reduce the rate of inflation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the Territory, a Legislative Council first met in 1948; it has evolved, and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> strength has progressively grown with steps in 1 959 and 1 968, culminating in the establishment of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly of nineteen members in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, I and, I think, my Party believe that referendums on questions such as this can and even should be overruled by <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments if, as in 1974, there is a compelling reason and a logical argument to justify such government action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if  Senator Webster  or any other honourable senator cares to look at the history of voting in municipal elections in Victoria, for example, he will see that for 20, 30 or 40 years councillors and people in the local government area have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office by a minority of citizens voting at municipal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this mean that  Senator Walsh  also believes that governments should not be pushed around by trade unions and that a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to act for the people and not to stand aside and let others try to take over government, as some of the unions are trying to do at present regarding the export of merino rams from this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even now there are elements in Australia seeking to replace the government of men by the administration of things, a trend to which we in Parliament have contributed by unthinkingly vesting power over people in non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> bodies and corporations  and by seeking to rely upon ombudsmen and tribunals to protect the rights of individuals when in fact it is we who should be making the decisions and we who should be providing the protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our responsibility as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to address ourselves accordingly, to remember that we are not sent here to scratch out each other’s eyes, no matter how much we might enjoy that sort of thing, but to serve the people who sent us here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ordinance, in its present form, has been brought in by the Government in order to circumvent the clearly expressed wishes of the people of Canberra and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives on the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have decided as a government, and quite rightly so, that matters relating to the Australian Capital Territory, matters that have great social consequence and matters that have wide-ranging consequences for the people in this community will be debated, discussed and decided by those people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will understand from those words of  Mr Hunt  that the Government had promised the people of Canberra that they could decide through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> body, the Legislative Assembly, the manner in which abortions would be carried out in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the period of time that this matter will be resolved the Government should develop and present to the Parliament a permanent ordinance which will honour its promise to the people of Canberra that their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives will take decisions in respect of the way in which abortions will be carried out in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one starts advocating in this chamber that we just cut out what we want to cut out or increase what we want to increase in this way or that, I think that has to be viewed in the context of the responsibility of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government- a responsibility which it must carry- to prepare a Budget which can be rejected and on which the people have a chance to vote or which is otherwise relatively unalterable by this chamber, whatever this chamber may think about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that there are times in the life of every government when perhaps not all wisdom is demonstrated in the decisions taken by the group which comprises the senior executive of the party that is in government; and that the democratic process involves some opportunity for input by all the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people who constitute the total Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of course the consistent view of this Government that staff representatives should not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the bodies of organisations such as this- either to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, for example, or the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the Birch report recommended that the  Chairman  of the Advisory Council be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That decision to deny a staff-<span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner was taken against the wishes of the ABC Staff Association, many members of the management, other members of staff and some commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that when he was Acting Prime Minister after the coup d d’etat and later after he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, he said that his idea of a properly run media was to have sport, and sport alone, on the front pages of the newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To bring the debate back to today’s industrial action, which is the reason why I am speaking on this subject, I draw the attention ofthe Senate to the present major imbalance on the Commission caused by the Government’s denial of the appointment of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister claimed that he would not appoint a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner because such a  decision somehow  would interfere with the independence of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that if he were invited by the commissioners to consider the appointment of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner he would do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also claimed that there was no need, in the view of the Government, for the appointment of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner because trade unionists were appointed to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these claims by the Minister do not answer the arguments raised by the ABC Staff Association in favour of the appointment of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what happened last Wednesday when one commissioner moved that a delegation from the Staff Association be heard by the Commission in order to present the case of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think it is clear from the action of those two commissioners that  Mr Staley  ‘s view about having trade unionists appointed to the Commission does not answer the case put strongly by the Staff Association for a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must add that the Minister is evading his responsibility by trying to suggest that somehow it is the responsibility of the other members of the Commission to invite the Minister to appoint a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commmissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of another commissioner, the Minister should not use the Commission in this way to get himself off the hook with regard to the staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision not to allow a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner to be appointed is bad because the Commission cannot discharge its responsibilities properly without information about the day to day concerns of its staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission will not have this day to day information about the staff without a commissioner <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point in the debate I express the hope that at a future meeting the newly constituted Commission will reverse the decision of the Commission announced last Wednesday, will reopen the question ofthe appointment of a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner and accept  Mr Staley  ‘s invitation to put such a proposal to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call for a balanced Commission, which must include a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What apparently exercised the staff into having a strike today and what apparently exercised the Opposition into bringing forward this matter of public importance is the fact that a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner has not been reappointed by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the one staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner,  Mr Marius  Webb, was appointed by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Witness, for example, the present Minister for Post and Telecommunications sheltering behind the commissioners of .the ABC for not having offered him advice regarding the reappointment or- otherwise of a staff-<span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner when Cabinet Ministers had made up their minds that so far as they were concerned they would not have a bar of the appointment of a staff-<span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real issue is whether on a subject such as abortion the wishes ofthe locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature should be paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have decided as a government, and quite rightly so, that matters relating to the Australian Capital Territory, matters that have great social consequence and matters that have wide-ranging consequences for the people in this community will be debated, discussed and decided by those people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to achieve the situation in which that democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> and representative Assembly’s recommendations may be implemented, there are various means by which that can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan  said that we should obey the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian Capital Territory and their recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the number of people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> at that time- 18 members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly- we find that nearly one-third of them have since retired or died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So only two-thirds of the original <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly have made that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest- nearly one-third or five members of the Assembly- have not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> but have been appointed to their positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in a legislature, when finding themselves in conflict with a decision of the Executive Government, should consider very clearly that the underpinning of this system is that the will of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members as a whole should prevail over the will of the Executive of any parliamentary institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the residents of the Territory who voted at the last elections for the Assembly- 38,500 people voted from the Canberra electorate and 41,000 from the Fraser electorate- are entitled to see their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives pass legislation and make decisions affecting their lives because those representatives are the only people who are directly responsible, other than the four members of this Parliament, to the people whose lives are being affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the fundamental underpinning of the concept of representative democracy is not only that the representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> by individuals and citizens should make decisions of this nature and not people who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the citizens, but also that when the lives of individuals are affected they ought to have recourse against or in support of the people who made those decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What recourse do the citizens of the Capital Territory have other than to the four members of this Parliament who are immediately <span class="highlight">elected</span> by them when it comes to a decision about the representative nature of the other members here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as he rightly rejected making the people of the Capital Territory guinea pigs in a social laboratory, so we should reject making the people of the Capital Territory guinea pigs in a social fossil reflecting the prejudices of the Federal Government at the expense of the views of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that people believe that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Capital Territory have no part to play in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Assembly is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, regardless of whether it has powers at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second major issue is involved, that is, the extent to which the wishes of the Legislative Assembly, admittedly without powers, nevertheless <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, should be taken into account by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this issue has far-reaching social consequences for the people of the Australian Capital Territory, I feel it should be discussed and debated by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Assembly in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘final decisions’-  of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of Canberra in the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of her speech she made great play of the fact that this issue was not an election issue for the Assembly when it was last <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying, in a sense, that members of this chamber and of this Parliament went to the electors and were <span class="highlight">elected</span> last year and therefore people are entitled to say that it was an election issue insofar as we are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be a respectable point of view, but I think that on such a massive moral issue, an issue which affects something like a quarter of a million Australian women a year, those women are entitled to hear the views of their <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion let me say that I think every one of these recommendations-  Senator Hamer  said that there were 51- carry a great deal of common sense, but surely the whole point is that the question was investigated and adjudged by the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confounded to know what rights senators from Victoria, New South Wales or Western Australia have to support a government which says to the people of the Australian Capital Territory: ‘We do not give a damn about what your <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives said after a 90-day survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was designed as a means of putting before this chamber the recommendations of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> body representing the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The central issue is whether or not the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of the Capital Territory have the right to bring down a report that should be accepted by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators should not, however, represent members of a committee of an advisory body, several of whom I am told are appointed and not <span class="highlight">elected</span>, as being in a position to speak for the people of the Australian Capital Territory, regardless of whether the matter is political or one of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have decided as a government, and quite rightly so, that matters relating to the Australian Capital Territory, matters that have great social consequence and matters that have wide-ranging consequences for the people in this community will be debated, discussed and decided by those people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr HUNT; We have decided as a government, and quite rightly so, that matters relating to the Australian Capital Territory, matters that have great social consequence and matters that have wide-ranging consequences for the people in this community will be debated, discussed and decided by those people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 47 recommendations were heard in one night’s debate by a part-time Legislative Assembly, one-third of whose members were not <span class="highlight">elected</span> but appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it has the support of a majority of the people and specifically, I suggest, of the women of the Australian Capital Territory and of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Ryan  had not taken the opportunity to give notice of disallowance of the Ordinance in order to have this matter debated, the Legislative Assembly’s decision would not have been given mature consideration and the people of the Australian Capital Territory would not have had a chance to express through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives the belief that there should be established such principles and such ordinances that would bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with the way in which most Australian States are operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very simple strategem that  Senator Ryan  has adopted in this case is to give the Senate an opportunity to disallow an ordinance which was made by the Minister when he put aside the advice given to him by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I hope that he does not mean that it should have self-government so long as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> body does not make any decisions that would embarrass the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also abhorrent to us who hold strongly to the democratic principles that a Minister of this Parliament should make a promise in this Parliament that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives ofthe people of the Australian Capital Territory, the Legislative Assembly, could make decisions with regard to the termination of pregnancy and then later repudiate his serious promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently I did what I should have done a long time ago- namely, shortly after I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place- that is, to go back and look at the original purpose of the Senate Estimates committees to see the background which went into the setting up of those committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The person <span class="highlight">elected</span> by this Senate to be the  President  of this Senate- is that the Public Service Board has concurred in his view that 10 new positions should be created to cope with the new functions and extra work load of the Senate, but that these positions must be staffed from within the staff ceiling imposed by the Government in June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I refer to a matter which I consider important may I take the opportunity of saying that the Senate staff, the pay staff in particular, is very courteous and prompt, but I agree with what  Senator Georges  said concerning a newly-<span class="highlight">elected</span> senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, last week Labor’s spokesman on the Australian Capital Territory announced that self-government in the Capital Territory would  cost  ‘no more ‘ if Labor were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I say that when the Labor Party is in government the Liberal Party uses the chamber as a House of frustration and frustrates not only the Labor government but also the will of the electors who in 1972 and again in 1974 <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Labor government under the Prime Ministership of Gough Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We gave to the grape growers a clear undertaking in our 1972 election policy that if Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> we would remove the excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just for the information of  Senator Baume,  shortly after that we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office and we did remove the excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, price control over grapes in South Australia was introduced in 1965 when Mrwho was the Premier at that time after Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Labor Party stand by what we did in 1965 when we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in South Australia and introduced price control on grapes because it was of major assistance to the grape growers who were at the mercy of the wineries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not delve into that statement because it is already on the record but it is clear to everyone that when  Mr Lynch  was Treasurer he gave an undertaking to the grape growers throughout the length and breadth of Australia that if the Liberal and National Country Parties were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> they would reinstate section 31a and thereby remedy the situation which the Labor Party had been criticised for creating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides also that in application of these principles the University will not be able to allocate compulsory fees moneys to student representative organisations on campus unless the members of the governing body of those organisations have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by at least one-quarter of the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question could be raised about what would happen if a public servant was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and did not resign his public servant appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amendments will be necessary because some existing legislation is based on the assumption that public servants cannot be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal Parliament whilst still holding their public service appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975 after promising that pensions would be adjusted instantly and automatically in relation to quarterly consumer price index figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That, whereas by virtue of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> through universal suffrage, the Government Members now sitting in the House of Representatives were authorised to implement their state objectives by legislation and that such authority did not extent to acting otherwise or to enact legislation not previously submitted to he will of the people, namely: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A grand total of something like 2.5 million human beings in this country were resting on an assumption that when  Mr Fraser  and his Government were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> they would continue indexing those pensions at least once every six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When an event happens that threatens the very power of this democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> institution- the Parliament- they do not even notice that it has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sometimes wonder what is wrong with us as parliamentarians because we go through this charade of coming to the Parliament as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people and we allow the head of the Executive Government to make a statement such as the one to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that people listening to this broadcast are aware that she is smiling because I do not believe that her attitude is one which expresses the concern that should be felt by a person who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place to cater for the needs of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That promise was repeated in 1977, and it was one of the first of the promises to be broken by the Liberal and National Country Party Government after it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that we have a great many pensioners in the community who rely on us as their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to look after their needs, and this Government is not catering for the needs of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seemed to me and I think to many people to be an exercise in politics which only goes to confirm what I am saying now, that is, that some vital and basic step needs to be taken by the Parliament to show the people of this country that it genuinely consists of a group of people who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the interests of the nation and that it is not afraid- I repeat that the Parliament is not afraid- of placing more power in the hands of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is quite defeatist and wrong and perhaps we are failing in our duty to the public who <span class="highlight">elected</span> us even to suggest or begin to feel that basic agreement on a future plan should not be laid down with basic guidelines to which every party might agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would suggest that if these ideas are not raised and ventilated they tend to disappear back into obscurity when, of course, we should always be looking at our role, our methods and the way in which we can best serve people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> us to this Parliament and who pay us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I readily acknowledge that citizen initiative does enjoy some current popularity in certain overseas countries, particularly the United States, it is true that the idea of citizen initiative and a referendum dates from the time, and was most fashionable at the time, when nations were essentially run by elites <span class="highlight">elected</span> by rich and powerful minorities, when full adult franchise was unknown, when representative democracy was not fully developed, and when there was genuine frustration at the absence of an opportunity for the popular voice to make itself heard in the business of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>George Ill’s attempt to reassert the power of the monarchy stimulated the development of the doctrine that Ministers should be united by political principle and that the Prime Minister should be the freely <span class="highlight">elected</span> chosen leader of his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that a central point of this legislation, and indeed any legislation dealing with security, will be the establishment of the relationship between the security service, its director-general or permanent head, whatever title he may have at the time, and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Time will not permit me to give an answer as to what Labor did in its three years of office, but it did insist on its members declaring their pecuniary interests to the Prime Minister when Ministers were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of Australia, I feel that we should know some more about such matters in order that we can make a proper judgment on the value of this legislation, or just what ASIO has been all about and on what it is likely to be about in the future- whether it is worth the provision which is made for it in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inference I draw from those paragraphs is not only that the organisation was incompetent but also that it was quite obvious that those in charge of it had to have their arms twisted up their backs before they would give  Mr Justice  Hope the information he sought under his charter- a charter from the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975 after promising that pensions would be adjusted instantly and automatically in relation to quarterly Consumer Price Index figures; and whereas that Government subsequently announced that pension adjustments should properly be made half yearly each May and November; it is the current intention of the same Government to legislate for pensions to be adjusted only once a year, and this constitutes a serious breach of generally accepted ethics of democratic government and also deprives many needy pensioners of increases that are essential to their subsistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has often been a feeling in the Committee, I discern, that really important subject matters of territorial ordinances, matters of sensitivity, difficulty or real significance, ought to be subject to proper debate and indeed enactment by a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also a matter of gratification to the Government that the agreement which was made with the Queensland Government in April 1978 has reached the point where we now have <span class="highlight">elected</span> shire councils with statutory rights and with leases to the original land areas of Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder how much of the agitation against  Sir John  Kerr in 1975- he was hounded and cried down at universities and at various demonstrations in Australia- was contributed to by the subversion of Labor Party members because of their description of  Sir John  Kerr’s dismissal of a lawfully, democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the Government is saying that any person who is a trade unionist may be held under surveillance because in the opinion of the ASIO officer the person may ultimately be involved in a challenge to the constitutional or <span class="highlight">elected</span> government or may be involved in an unlawful act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This chamber, which exercised unlawful activities in refusing Supply to a lawfully and constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government in 1974 and 1975, is now charged by the AttorneyGeneral with not carrying out its proper function and with engaging in idle speculation in reviewing the legislation to see whether the words mean what they say or whether they mean much more than they say or they are alleged to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, it draws attention to the local government elections in Queensland and draws particular attention to the fact that the Aboriginal people of that area have re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> councillors who previously were not regarded with great favour by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the councils that were <span class="highlight">elected</span> last Saturday, we have not had all the details; things have been filtering through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently they were suppressed because some people were <span class="highlight">elected</span> whom the hierarchy did not want <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of the elections at both communities still have to be declared but the figures so far are rather enlightening in view of the fact that some months ago the Queensland Government sacked the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal councils on both <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the two communities have now been declared local government areas, there has been an increase in the number of councillors <span class="highlight">elected</span> at both Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the most interesting part about it is that out of the eight councillors <span class="highlight">elected</span>, five were members of the former Aboriginal council which was sacked by the Queensland Government under the direction of the Minister for Local Government, the Honourable, in inverted commas, Russ Hinze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Aurukun, four of the previous Aboriginal councillors out of eight were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Donald Painkinna of Aurukun was also re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there are five members of the Council out of a total number of eight who have been re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that three additional councillors have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to local government so that when one looks at the election of four out of five of the previous councillors at Aurukun and five out of five of the previous councillors at Mornington Island who have been re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> to the councils of both of these communities, it surely proves to us in this chamber that negotiations between the Commonwealth Government, through the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, and the present Minister, Fred Chaney, have been successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> shire councillors of both communities have been re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> to those councils to run the affairs of the Aboriginal people of both of those communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt  did not indicate that the only time this tax has been mentioned in elections was when an undertaking was given by a State parliamentary party that, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, it would grant a rebate, a reduction of personal income tax- not an increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the kind of constraint which we regard as a minor practical price to pay for the maintenance of this quite crucial principle to which I now return: When we are exercising powers of this sweeping, Draconic and potentially privacy-invading kind- we have spoken about them at length before- we have to be sure that if they are not to be exercised on the authority of a judge, which many people regard as the desirable way of doing things, at least they are exercised by an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Minister of the Crown who is directly and personally accountable to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975 after promising that pensions would be adjusted instantly and automatically in relation to quarterly consumer price index figures; and whereas that Government subsequently announced that pension adjustments should properly be made half yearly each May and November; and whereas the Government has now legislated for pensions to be adjusted only once a year, and this constitutes a serious breach of generally accepted ethics of democratic government and also deprives many needy pensioners of increases that are essential to their subsistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it seems to me that the point that has been put forward by  Senator Missen,  that is, that the decision to deny to an individual Australian citizen any notification of the fact that an adverse security assessment of him exists, should not be left solely in the hands of a person who, whatever his character as AttorneyGeneral, is also nevertheless a partisan political figure who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a partisan political situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question therefore is not a matter of debating that, but a matter of debating whether in fact the civil liberties of the individual concerned are adequately protected by vesting this power in one <span class="highlight">elected</span> public official or whether they are better protected by vesting them initially in one <span class="highlight">elected</span> public official, with that official being required to have his decision subject to review or further consideration by a person who has been appointed to a particularly sensitive position as the presidential member of the Security Appeals Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that members of the Legislative Assembly be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a method of proportional representation, the whole of Norfolk Island constituting a single electoral division; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key things to appreciate about the constitutional system which is created by this Bill are as follows: First of all, it confers minimal powers on the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly; secondly, it confers negligible powers on the appointed Executive Council; thirdly, it gives quite excessive powers to the Australian Government appointed administrator; and, fourthly, it enables the retention by the Australian Government, acting through the Governor-General, as the Bill puts it, of quite excessive residual powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position of Administrator is not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> office but rather is filled on appointment by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that, contrary to comments that have been made in certain quarters about the Bill, there has been the utmost consultation throughout its consideration and preparation over a period of a year with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Island’s residents, the Norfolk Island Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Norfolk Island people will respond to the challenge and that they and the Norfolk Island people will avail themselves to the utmost of the opportunity now given to them to manage the affairs of the Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition takes the view that for power of this kind to be vested in the Governor-General and not be subject to any sanction, any power, any intervention or any redress, if the islanders are unhappy about it, by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly, is to make absolute nonsense of the supposed scheme of the Bill which vests primary money powers in respect to activities on the island in that Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Leader of the Government in the Senate will recall that after fewer than 500 days in office the Whitlam Government, which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972, was forced to go to the polls, and that after the Whitlam Government was re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1974 only 579 days in office were possible before the Parliament was dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, after examination, what I have said is found to be correct are we going to say that no penalty should be imposed on a man who is supposed to be an honourable and responsible <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of  Her  Majesty’s Parliament and who has behaved in that way against someone doing a service for politicians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is a rule that Ministers of the Crown and the Prime Minister can have the cost of their departure tax met from official sources, surely members of this Parliament who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to attend official delegations as representatives of the Parliament and the country are also entitled to have their departure tax paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a retrograde step, in what is supposed to be a democratic system, that the rights of a properly and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> body to make decisions with regard to local community organisations should have been taken away arbitrarily and placed in the hands of the Minister himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate is not about particular decisions taken by a body of the Legislative Assembly at a particular time; it is about whether we are to follow the democratic principle of locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> members making decisions or whether we are to be subject to the extremely arbitrary decisions taken by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be consistent with the explicit terms of the Australian Labor Party platform, which emphasises not only that the Public Service should be politically responsive in the sense of being capable of satisfying the requirements of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day, and not only that the Public Service be responsive and accountable to the community as a whole, but also that the Public Service should operate with the maximum efficiency in delivering analysis, advice and program implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  you and those honourable senators who are on the Parliamentary Library Committee and on other committees associated with the operation of this Parliament know as well as I do how jealously we regard our rights; that is, the rights of this Parliament- a body of representative persons directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia- against the intrusions of the Executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a cause of concern that the Government does tend to regard this sort of controversial social legislation as something that they can bulldoze through, as if it is a matter for political advantage taking and numbers rather than the sort of consultation and reasonable consensus that this Parliament ought properly to provide since everyone of us here after all has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by Australians to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the process they have attended, in numbers, meetings at which they have heard reports from their <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials and have subsequently taken certain action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That employment is subject to the needs of the Australian people as conveived by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would make the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Minister accountable for police actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other point I wish to make involves the division of powers between the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government and the monarch of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the notion of operational autonomy, which looms very large, of course, in the Mark report, and presumably in the Government’s thinking in writing this Bill in the way it has, ought not in the Opposition’s view to be attained at the cost of removing or weakening the principle of the accountability of police to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why we want to do that is to make it absolutely clear that this clause does not refer to any personal discretion vested in the GovernorGeneral, but rather of an essentially political decision which is made in accordance with the advice rendered to the Governor-General by his <span class="highlight">elected</span> Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role of the Senate is not being talked about at all at the moment, but one-third of the people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate are from the white minority and one-third are from the ranks of the tribal chiefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be brought to the attention of every elector, how the Government of the day just uses this House to ramrod its legislation through without giving any consideration to the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> as the Opposition and who want to put a point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Developments over the past few months within Namibia, including the installation on 2 1 May of the internally <span class="highlight">elected</span> Namibian Constituent Assembly as a national assembly with legislative powers and reports of continuing armed clashes between the South African forces and the South West African People’s Organisation can only further retard prospects for an early implementation of the plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The electors of Australia clearly recall the Fraser Government’s frequent promises that tax would be reduced and that, if they <span class="highlight">elected</span> and subsequently re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>, the Liberal-National Country parties they would be, in fact, supporting lower taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The end of the world did not come in respect of our relations with the United States, and there is absolutely no evidence, except in the thinking processes of this Government or of the intelligence organisations, that these sorts of consequences would flow from any attempt by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian people to exercise some surveillance, some control and some influence over what we on this side of the House believe ought to be the correct and responsible role of the legislator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, for some 58 of those 79 years they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments of our philosophy and kidney- governments of a federalist nature- and have rejected, for all but 20 years, governments of a socialist, centralist nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the reasons why it has not been used is that fortunately people would be ashamed to use such a procedure which would take the right of discussion away from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members and, as it were, lock it up behind closed doors by limiting who may enter the discussion in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this for two reasons, first because the terms of settlement it envisages are essentially right in themselves in that they are based on the principles that the people of Zimbabweall the people- have the right to chose who shall govern them, and that the government so <span class="highlight">elected</span> should have real control over the affairs of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have also noticed that there is to be a stay of proceedings before the <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials actually take office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has not the right, as a democratically-<span class="highlight">elected</span> senator, to say what he believes about Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchises, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators who are familiar with the operation of local government in Australia undoubtedly have been affronted from time to time to see the alleged representations of the people- the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people- hive themselves off into private and secret discussion and make decisions which affect individuals and ratepayers without making themselves open to public and Press scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In case there are a few other gullible people who have been persuaded by  Senator Messner’s  incoherent argument- that State governments exert a substantial influence on the levels of employment and economic activity- I emphasise the fact that in 1 974 when a Liberal government was last <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in Western Australia, that State had the lowest rates of unemployment and of inflation in the Commonwealth, but that after four years of  Sir Charles  Court’s Government it had the highest figures of any State in both categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 260 of the Act itself embodies the view of the Parliament- the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of this country- that certain transactions entered into, whilst legal in themselves and allowed to stand in relation to every other aspect of their operation, ought not to have any effect against the Commonwealth revenue, and tax avoidance is thereby branded by this Parliament as anti-social and therefore null and void as against the Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is more effective, not because Parliament has agreed with the proposition that tax avoidance is good whilst tax evasion is evil; tax avoidance has become effective because it has been aided and abetted, I regret to say, by a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> and therefore, in a strict sense, politically irresponsible bench of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential methodof proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister think it is a slight on every New South Wales senator that, in view of the 72-hour limitation on this breathing space, in effect, on Friday his legal officers will go into court and indicate the Government’s intentions when information is denied to <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators from New South Wales on how the Government is going to overcome the impasse? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is proper that, if possible, the people ‘s <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives should have a say in every decision made by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that my friend,  Senator Messner  from South Australia, should interject because for the first time ever at the last State election in New South Wales, a Labor candidate,  Mr Mair,  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as the State Labor member for Albury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that in the 1973-75 period three, if not four, such adjustments were made but only one, in 1976, has been made since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that it was a lie was proven because the votes for a candidate for the Australian Democrats- a minority party- were counted and he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 election campaign it was promised in Kalgoorlie by  Mr Lynch,  among others, that a Liberal Party Government, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, would take steps to ensure that the gold mining industry in Kalgoorlie was sustained at the level which then operated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Liberal Government did nothing and allowed the gold mines to close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Opposition refused to accept that verdict and immediately began to institute a series of procedures in order to defeat the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day, and it succeeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Government needs to be reminded again and again that the then Opposition used the Loan Bill in this place as a device to stop the flow of funds to the community in order to defeat the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not refer to the ballot boxes of 1975 or 1977 because the then Opposition took the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day to the ballot box at the height of its unpopularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House was misused for the sole purpose of destroying the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day and of denying the people their right to the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that honourable senators opposite deliberately used the device of this Bill to defeat the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before- it will be repeated again and again in this place- the Liberal-National Country Party coalition used the device falsely in this place and brought this chamber into discredit to defeat the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the Bill initially, it seemed that this was a classic case of the Government’s doing what it ought to do, namely, removing restrictions on a human right from the realm of administrative decision and Executive discretion and putting down a statement in the Parliament on the criteria so that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives could either adopt them or reject them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an administrative discretion is exercisable, it would seem only appropriate that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ought to be available to ensure that the discretion is exercised in accordance with criteria laid down by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, if this Bill is passed into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those were the policies upon which this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and which it has an obligation at least to attempt to fulfil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is too important to the State that  Senator Jessop  and I represent to go unnoticed, with no great concern being shown by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After these accidents in July, the French Polynesian Territorial Assembly, the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people who live in the area, resolved that the French Government had to suspend atomic testing at Mururoa until a Territorial commission of inquiry had carried out its own inquiry into safety at the site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What steps does the Government propose should be taken to bring the Public Service Board under the jurisdiction of the Parliament so that its authoritarian and undemocratic procedures are supervised by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly they are not inspiring the regeneration of the economy which was supposed to have been the strategy of this Government when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, it embarked on a program to phase-out the nitrogenous fertilisers bounty which had stood for many years at a level of $80 per tonne of nitrogen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it may be deterred from doing that by the fact that next year will be an election year and it will probably wait, hoping to be re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1980- although that looks an increasingly forlorn hope- with the intention of passing legislation in 1981 to phase out the bounty from 1 January 1982. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the reduction in the subsidy did not take place until the first Fraser Administration was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It would seem from what has happened since the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> that the advisers of the Government have decided that the laws relating to industrial relations ought to be tightened in respect to the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December 1975 my Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with a clear mandate to rectify this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement adds to my confusion, apprehension and disenchantment of this place as a forum for democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators to express a view verbally and in a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was much pleased when  Mr Tonkin’s  Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to see that the first thing he did was to have discussions with the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, for the purpose of co-operation, if nothing else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the three Liberal Party governments that are trying to create a dispute with the trade unions have served half of their <span class="highlight">elected</span> terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators that in 1975  Mr Fraser  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> because he promised the Australian people that only under a Liberal government would there be jobs for all who wanted to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall that not long after this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1975, it moved savagely against some social services beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Labor Party announces its social security program and its pre-election programs, the people of this country can at least be assured that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government it will carry out those programs, unlike the present Government, which we well remember put forward a platform for the indexation of pensions automatically and immediately in line with cost of living increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless we are fully convinced, following the submissions we have received and the evidence we have heard, that if our democratic system of government is to be properly responsive to the views of those whom we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to serve, the Government’s legislation must be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we believe, as the Committee has clearly stated, that democracy as a system of government is operational only when there is available a maximum degree of public information about what the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, and their permanent servants, are up to- if that belief is held not only by the Committee but also by the members of the Parliament who constitute the Executive- I believe the report and its recommendations should see their way speedily into legislative form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think most people, if not all who have visited Aurukun and Mornington Island, would agree that those communities, with their <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils, upholding tenure of the land under 50-year renewable leases, has been a success story which - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of great single importance was the extension of the powers and prerogatives of <span class="highlight">elected</span> Community Councils, which as corporate bodies are now able to accept greater responsibilities for the conduct of their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were the old fashioned Parliament men, if I can so describe them, like Jim Killen, who were against what they perceived to be an encroachment by the judiciary on the rights, prerogatives and preserves of the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reason we ought to ratify it is that we have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian people, are involved in creating for the first time an Act relating to human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is quite different from the proposition I am putting that one needs a judicial Bill of rights or list of human rights in the sense that, once they are denned with as great a precision as is possible by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, an independent and impartial tribunal, a judiciary, ought to be given the power to enforce them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government has failed to do is to go through the hard exercise of developing a list of human rights appropriate to the Australian situation, detailed as unambiguously as possible, and then to say to the judiciary: ‘We have done our part as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in identifying the rights necessary for Australians in a democratic society; you develop the remedies and apply them, whether by way of injunction, direction, damages or whatever’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might perhaps say for completeness of this part of the  Hansard  record that I believe that  Senator Puplick  and  Senator Missen,  in their remarks on the judicial enforceability of a Bill of Rights, were directing their remarks only to the need, with which I agree, to have a list of human rights which is sufficiently precise, comprehensive and free of ambiguity that it amounts to a direction by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people to the courts that these are the rights to be secured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we need is an Australian government, or an Australian parliament, which is prepared to say that we are the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people and that these are the rights which ought to be secured, as appropriate to the Australian context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> bench of justices, an impartial body, should then have the task of enforcing them by means of directions, injunctions, disallowing of evidence and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives should be in some way made more responsible for securing any particular human right which is said by the Human Rights Commission to have been violated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, on the tabling of that report, ought to be faced with the difficult decision of either affirming the law or saying that, an inconsistency with a human right having been revealed, it ought not to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the tabling ought to lead to a decision by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives as to which will prevailthe law which authorises the action or the human right of the person concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, as a member of the international community in good standing and also as a recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, it is very embarrassing for us not to have ratified a covenant on human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in this Parliament some days ago, the present Government in South Australia was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on an untruth, and it has to live with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">elected</span> both in 1975 and 1977, there was no doubt in the mind of anybody who cared to investigate the matter that the Government parties were opposed to the principles of compulsory unionism and would seek where possible to bring about a situation in which membership of any such organisations was entirely voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not arrayed merely against the student associations on the various campuses- associations democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>, associations not captured by the Australian Liberal Students Federation, to which I will come in a moment and which is behind this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body of any sort its success or failure will depend fairly heavily upon student participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Previously the executive had largely been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a State by State basis allowing groups with a narrow majority in certain States to achieve an overwhelming majority on the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously the regional organisers had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by delegates at AUS regional conferences under a collegiate system and that, in turn, resulted in the appointment of some people which might have been thought, perhaps properly in some quarters, as inappropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator may not know that last week the executive of the National Aboriginal Conference, which is the <span class="highlight">elected</span> body representing Aboriginal opinion around Australia, dealt with the proposal for a treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third major problem with this legislation is that expressed in paragraph (c) of the second reading amendment, which states that the Senate:  expresses its concern at the lack of effective accountability of the proposed Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government or Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr Whitlam  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in 1972 one of the first things that he did was to honour Labor’s promise that he would abolish the wine excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why cannot we, as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian taxpayer, be given the costs of those two residences so we can compare what this Prime Minister is costing the taxpayer with what he claimed the previous incumbent of the Prime Ministership was costing the taxpayer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the first statutory recognition of the National Aboriginal Conference and thus focuses on the National Aboriginal Conference as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative body of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat what  Senator Grimes  said about the way these people are <span class="highlight">elected</span>: It could be done in a much better way, having regard to the tried and true formula as applied by the Immigration Advisory Council over a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of this community have consistently said that tax avoidance is something anti-social and something which should have no effect against the revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
