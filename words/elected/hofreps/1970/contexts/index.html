    <p>Years ago, before he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament, the honourable member for Mackellar operated a newspaper in the Wollongong-Port Kembla area called the Illawarra Star’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the legislation, I can only say, as I have already said today, that I draw the attention of good trade unionists in Australia to the way in which they are so often misused by these people whom they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office believing they would serve their interests but who, in fact, are serving their own political interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say,  Mr Speaker,  that, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place, that in spite of the cascade of vituperation and the reams of ridicule heaped upon and hurled at the Leader of the Opposition, I am very proud indeed to be here to reinforce his crusading zeal and his humanitarian approach to many contemporary problems as he endeavours to put into practice the blueprint for a revitalised Australia as we enter the challenges and the rewards of the ’70s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have listened with amazement to Government members attacking the ordinary citizens of this great land and in fact, of my electorate, who happen to belong to a trade or labour organisation in the course of earning their living, and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, the shop stewards and union officials, who despite whatever political ideology they follow, step forward to present a citizen’s case in a similar manner to a member of Parliament, and are an essential component of the working of an arbitration system, some rising to the ranks of the Arbitration Commission itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We understand now that the Leader of the Opposition, who resigned and was re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> by 38 votes to 34, heads an executive that is controlled by the left wing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not until 1823 that advisory councils to the governor were established - not <span class="highlight">elected</span>, but appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All we require is leadership not only in the Federal sphere but also from the Premiers of the States and our State <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to get together on a true basis of federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to waste this help and support by dissipating my time on meaningless activity, and I say this as someone who has been given a special privilege by being <span class="highlight">elected</span> immediately on reaching this Parliament as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When policy items find their way from the rank and file in unions and sub-branches through our State conventions and Federal Conferences into the platforms of our Party, woe betide those of us who are the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this Parliament if we ignore those policy items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that too many politicians, even those who were previously associated with local government, are apt to forget the needs of local government when they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is distressing to see the situation which has developed in the parliamentary procedures of this country whereby Ministers work so assiduously to avoid informing the Australian public, as it is their <span class="highlight">elected</span> responsibility to do, on what developments have taken place in the administration of important national matters such as health, the economy - which is most important of all - primary industry, defence and the other subjects which the honourable member for Lalor mentioned when speaking to the amendment which is before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, we as <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons should leave it in decent silence to them! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our Federal system is being increasingly distorted by this argument that anything that goes on between Ministers, Commonwealth and State, is confidential to them and that nobody in any <span class="highlight">elected</span> parliament can debate these matters until they come in cut and dried in the form of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Agreement, in case the honourable member does not know, allows for a maximum storage capacity of 20% of the previous year’s total production, including excess sugar which means that something like 450,000 tons of excess sugar can be stored under maximum stocks under the provisions of the International Sugar Agreement which this Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the alternative provisions relating to this particular clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that there are no ladies and very few gentlemen here but I am quite sure that after the next election the former member for Kingston will be returned and a couple of other ladies will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this side of the House and we will again be blessed with feminine company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It amazes me how a man in his position, a man of so-called credibility, can go before a television audience and without blushing for one moment deny such an important thing, because the people of Queensland, if the Labor Party had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, would most definitely have lost what I understand to be and what most Queenslanders understand to be Queensland’s free hospital scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament I was employed in the Taxation Branch in the technical field for some 28 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1951 he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives as the member for the Australian Capital Territory and he remained the member for this Territory for 19 years up to the time of his death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably no member of this House of Representatives took his title so literally, was so single-mindedly the representative of the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> him, which certainly does not mean merely the people who voted for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me this is the crux of the third reading objections today because after all when a member is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent an electorate which will be the subject of legislation and is then prevented by a quite capricious action of the Government from making his contribution and making a submission on 2 matters- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Labour and National Service, concerns what appears to be a growing tendency on the part of some militant unions to take the government of the country out of the hands of the constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government by an attempt through so called ‘black bans’ to circumvent the policy of the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the opening part of the question, I think I should say very forthrightly that the constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government would not be prepared to allow minorities to take control of the conduct of its business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been proved over the years that that institution which best provides that order along with freedom for the citizen is the institution of Parliament, where decisions are made by a majority of those <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a majority of the people of the country at regular intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple truth of the matter is that the Opposition <span class="highlight">elected</span> to make it a trial and all of the Opposition’s argument as far as the motion of dissent from your ruling is concerned turns on the question of relevance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless those who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia to come into this place, speak their minds and take an intelligent part in the debates on our laws, even the Minister cannot expect us or anybody inside or outside the Parliament to have any respect for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I was rather reluctant to enter the lists, if I can phrase it in that way, in this debate, but as a new member <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament on 25th October last year I was then under the impression that I was coming to an honourable place to follow an honourable career, and to make an honourable contribution to contemporary society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let them be honest enough to say that this is the proposition they want to put forward, because it will make it much simpler for all the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members to return to their electorates where they can be doing useful work and not wasting the taxpayers’ money by sitting in this chamber just aborting the very work of the democratic processes of <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Victorian State Executive of the Australian Labor Party last night issued a document stating that a Victorian Labor government, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 30th May, would abolish State aid to independent schools in Victoria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present the various State governments are accepting the grants on these conditions but if the Victorian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> a government which had the policy reported as being that of the State executive of the Australian Labor Party against State aid it would be within its rights to refuse to accept the grants! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just by chance tonight the former leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  told us that if, in 1960, the Labor Party had <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Mr Ward  as its  deputy  leader the Party would have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power in 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition’s present policy of pushing the Territory into self-government by 1972 if, of course, it gets into power - a big ‘if - and independence by 1976 represents a drastic change from the policy pursued by the right honourable member for Melbourne Our policy is 1 of political change sanctioned by the people of Papua and New Guinea through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing is that the Government must be more clearly answerable to the public through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> parliamentary representatives and through the Parliament by doing these things that are the subject of discussion through regulations and so bringing them before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Looking at the list of directors of the Hospital Contribution Fund, I find that some are known to me and a number are reputable people, but some have evidently been selected for no other reason than that they are friends of  Mr Turner  and have been able to nominate him for membership of some organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any suggestion that this discussion with Ministers or that advice given by official members on the Committee had influenced <span class="highlight">elected</span> members improperly was met by a speech by the  Chairman  of the Committee,  Mr John  Guise, in the House of Assembly on 9th June 1967 when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By comparing the history of our legislatures in the Australian States in the last century with those in this century and by looking at the experience in other parts of the world, we know that it is the party system which makes an <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is remarkable that when a senator is first <span class="highlight">elected</span> or a member is first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a State house of parliament he is keen to go to these people and tell them that he intends to carry on with great crusading zeal to put everything right in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have so-called democratic funds such as the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria’ of which 4 of the 53 directors are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These funds are called democratic because, in this instance, 4 out of 53 directors are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and the other 49 are not <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, we have the so-called undemocratic organisations such as the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and the Hospital Contributions Fund of Australia in which none of the directors are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cast no reflection on those directors of funds who have integrity, but nobody knows who is a Huxley and who is not because nobody knows them, nobody knows how they are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, yet we are supposed to give them an open book so far as the investment of huge amounts of funds is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As last year in Trinidad we saw the importance of youth in revolt and the effect that this will have on the workings of parliament, so now we must see to what extent members of parliament are able to withstand pressure groups, moratorium marches, television programmes, opinion polls and the like to make certain that we maintain the role of the ballot box as the reason why members of parliament are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to enter parliament, and that the pressures from the ballot box are the chief pressures to which they should react. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to serve the people of Australia in Canberra and we should not run away from Canberra as the honourable member for Newcastle  (Mr Charles Jones)  admits he does whenever and as soon as he can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby),  who has just been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament, has realised what has hit him like an avalanche. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was Duncan Sandys who once said that he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the constituents of Streatham, if that was the electorate, to represent them in Parliament, not to represent the Parliament in Streatham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both views relate to the proper work of people <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place, and therefore the point made by the Minister that the system now proposed will make the most efficient use of the time, whether it is here or there, is the best point that has been made in this whole debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have said that a member is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent, in this Parliament, the people of his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is another indication of a willingness on the part of those who support the Opposition to see that nonelected persons outside the Parliament direct or influence <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons inside the Parliament who are charged with responsibility for the economy of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly I believe that it would be proper to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly the Bill provides that both senators for each Territory should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> every time there is a general election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is suggested that there may not be an election for the House of Representatives at the same time as there must be an election for half of the Senate at some time during this present financial year T would very happily accept an amendment to provide that the first 2 senators for each of the Territories should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the first election for either House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not concerned very much about the first 2 points because I could not possibly imagine, although it would be a terrible thing if it did happen, a  Speaker  being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in circumstances in which there was not at least a quorum present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 have not had time to check his statement, but, as far as my memory serves me, I should think that more than that number of honourable members would be present in the chamber when the  Speaker  and the  Chairman  of Committees are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To call the national strike apparently without even getting a resolution passed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions saying there should be a national strike unquestionably shows an approach to a Government of this country and to the rights of citizens in this country which rides completely roughshod over the concept of <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the public coming to this House and deciding economic and other policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the end of 1969 there were over 2’,000 villages and nearly 10,000 hamlets which had <span class="highlight">elected</span> administrations and only 90 villages and 330 hamlets which had appointed administrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Elected</span> governments have been established at the national level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what the Vietnamese have achieved in establishing an <span class="highlight">elected</span> regime at the national level and at the village and hamlet levels is something for which they deserve some credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole democratic system of government is based on the fact that although there are differences of opinion within a community, free elections are held, a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the majority and the laws that the Parliament passes prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now the left wing of the unions with the left-wing leader,  Mr Hawke,  and the left-wing-dominated Australian Labor Party with  Mr Whitlam  as its voice, all combine, forcefully, by demonstrations outside, which on occasions are quite violent, by strikes and threats of strikes, to defy <span class="highlight">elected</span> government and defy the laws of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is only in this area that <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people are able to look at the kind of guidelines that are brought forward for our programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I could summarise what I have to say in this sentence: Are we going to hand over responsibility to some other body, no matter how competent, how fair or how celebrated they may be in the public eye, just because we think that this is fairer and more democratic - and principally because they are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this very Parliament, which is the premier law making authority in the land, we witnessed not only blatant defiance of constitutional law and order and <span class="highlight">elected</span> authority by one misguided individual, but we saw the leader of a once great democratic Party stand up and incite his Party to anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The time has come when the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government must take a firm stand against these law breakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They of course have always bitterly opposed the decisions of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> leaders of rural industries - not only the experienced leaders of the wheat industry but the leaders of practically every other rural industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  prime objective is to destroy this <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the people by using every device available - by using  Mr Hawke  and the left wing of the trade union movement and by using strike action for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding my remarks on the rural section I point out that the essential difference between the Government’s policy and the Opposition’s policy is that the Government endeavours to implement the policy of the primary producers expressed through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, while the Opposition in a blatant vote catching exercise supports generally the dissentient minority without regard to the welfare of the industry and those engaged in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we can do our job as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of this country none of us at any time ought to be hesitant or unable to acquit ourselves in this medium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now I shall have a look at the changes which the Government itself proposes, lt proposes that there shall be 2 students to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Council by the student body, for the Council to be empowered to arrange, if it wishes, for separate representation of part time and full time students, and because it is providing for the representation of students it lowers the age of membership of the Council from 21 years to 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I could well imagine that members of the staff who may be very competent to be on the Council but who are not tremendously popular with the students could find themselves not <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would not be terribly difficult to have a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this city there is great interest in representation: It seems to me that if we can put members of this House on the Council of the College of Advanced Education that Council will benefit because, as the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  said, the Council will take to it members of this House, properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by this House, who will bring with them a width of experience and knowledge from whatever particular field they come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>three members of the teaching staff of the College <span class="highlight">elected</span> by that teaching staff; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>two students of the College <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the students of the College; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>before paragraph (a) insert the following paragraphs: “(aa) two senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Senate; (ab) two members of the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> by that House;”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the United States with its Congressional system recognises very much the importance of having <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people on all sorts of bodies determining policy, whether it is in regard to education, defence or anything else, and I do not believe that the trend in the Westminster system of Parliament is a healthy one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>), after paragraph (b) insert the following paragraph: (ba) three representatives of the community of the Australian Capital Territory <span class="highlight">elected</span> in  a  manner to be prescribed;’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are <span class="highlight">elected</span> specifically because of their known professional skills and their background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose there are a number of organisations that are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as I am a shadow Minister for Education and Science, let me say that if I have authority and if there were a change of Government, there would be an <span class="highlight">elected</span> local authority here governing education here and set up as a model. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I certainly believe that education in the Australian Capital Territory should be governed by a body <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not suggested that the entire Council should be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have suggested that it should contain an <span class="highlight">elected</span> element. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the principles that we apply to ministerial representatives as the representatives of <span class="highlight">elected</span> people should be applied in this instance also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quite necessary that we should validate this Bill because I understand that the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley)  may be in some difficulty with his back salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This practice was varied in 1957, when the then Minister for Labour and National Service, the late  Mr Harold  Holt, was included as a delegate because it was known that it was likely that he would be <span class="highlight">elected</span>  President  of the Conference, and it is usual for the  President  of the Conference to be appointed from delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was, in fact, <span class="highlight">elected</span>  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But having said that, I realise that the Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> and re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> on the proposition that it supports conscription, that it supports national service, and I think that we in the Opposition have to make the National Service Act as pleasant as possible from the point of view of the people who are affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only the honourable member for Fisher  (Mr Adermann),  who is unavoidably absent, and the Leader of my Party,  Mr McEwen,  were in this House when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 9th February 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He, in 1958, was appointed to the Senate to fill a casual vacancy and was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the general elections held later that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1964 and his term in the Senate was due to expire next June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that last year the Government said that it was setting up a joint study group consisting of Commonwealth officials and <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory to examine in detail the possibility of increasing the  Tole  of <span class="highlight">elected</span> members in the administration of State-like activities in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for the Northern Territory will be pleased to know that I have been advised today by the Administrator of the Northern Territory that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council have nominated 5 representatives to meet Commonwealth officers to begin discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council and the Commonwealth Government will do everything possible to have a comprehensive study made of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that the person holding the position of  President  of the Students Association is, in fact, <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that position, so in one sense the <span class="highlight">elected</span> student representative membership has been increased to two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the picture in Australia and I think that this amendment to the Act in fact very greatly liberalises the position in the Australian National University, not only in increasing the number of student representatives from 1 to 2 but also in reducing the age from 21 years to 18 years, in providing that graduates do not have to be of 2. years standing but may be <span class="highlight">elected</span> immediately on graduation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The number of students who accepted scholarships in the years 1958-1970 is as follows: (In a small number of cases, a few students who accepted awards in the years shown <span class="highlight">elected</span> to defer their scholarship and to commence studies in the following year.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came into this chamber somewhat briefly, cast a glance along the front benches, went a mile up the road and addressed the Young Liberal gathering and said that if he were in office again or if he were to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Federal House he would suggest that Cabinet ought to be drawn from the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people - the general public: - and it is about time this laissez-faire Government that has been sitting in power for over 20 years and which blames everybody but itself every time a crisis occurs, faced up to its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place he look months to come into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the suspension of the sitting I pointed out how the sugar industry is a model of socialisation - that is, not national ownership, not national dictation, but control by the people involved, the consumers and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives co-operating with the producers for the welfare of society as a whole - and how it is a model for all other industries to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget that this Government, which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, is charged with the responsibility of maintaining real value in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also true, as the Minister pointed out in his statement, that if a immunity believes that the circulation of certain material is objectionable to itself as a community, it has the right, through its democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government to protect itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take- the view that we as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members  of- this Parliament are, in fact, a cross-section of the people and that we should reflect in this place the views of the community ‘and therefore the attitudes of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most parents impose standards for their children - standards of action and standards relating to the material which they can see, read or hear - and I believe most parents would like their <span class="highlight">elected</span> represen-tatives to help them to maintain these community standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you of the fact that I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House on 9th February 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His Excellency  the Governor-General commissioned me, as the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party to form a Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I want to make is that under section 28 of the Commonwealth Constitution - and I would have thought that the honourable gentleman bad some knowledge of constitutional practice - members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or if the honour able gentleman wants to go back to 1922 and have a look at the circumstances in which a great Labor leader was then associated - that is the period in 1922 when  Mr Hughes  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> Leader of the Nationalist Party - he will see that when  Mr Hughes  came to the House he found that he did not have the support of the Nationalist and Country Parties and, consequently, he had to seek an audience with the Governor-General and ask that a new leader be chosen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the party room immediately after I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as Leader of the Party there was a unanimous vote from the Party expressing confidence in me and wishing me well as Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia, where a Labor Government was recently <span class="highlight">elected</span>,  Mr Joe  Chamberlain, the Svengali of the Labor Party, is still at loggerheads with the Premier of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One whom they <span class="highlight">elected</span> has been cut down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Labor Party trying to say now that if a Prime Minister other than  Mr Gorton  had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> then, a new general election would have been needed to give that new Prime Minister a mandate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For more than 50 years out of the last 70 years, the people of Australia have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office governments espousing the kinds of policies and philosophies shared by the Liberal and the Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying anything derogatory about any other man in this place, but  1  venture to suggest that the Prime Minister we have <span class="highlight">elected</span> is a man of outstanding capacity who is capable of guiding the economic affairs of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of 33 members of the Liberal Party who told his predecessor 5 minutes before the Prime Minister was <span class="highlight">elected</span> that the predecessor had their confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, every time there is an election each individual is <span class="highlight">elected</span> as the representative of his constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individually <span class="highlight">elected</span> Liberal Party members in choosing the present Prime Minister as their Leader were exercising the rights and privileges accorded to them by their electors, and it is utter poppycock to deny them these rights when so much is said of the necessity for parliamentarians to assert their rights within this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individual members of the Liberal Party and of the Country Party retain their right to elect their officers and it is because they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as representatives by their constituencies that they have that right throughout the duration of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I oppose this motion for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that [ consider the time taken in debating it is a colossal waste of valuable time ‘ which could be better employed in getting on with the business of government which is the purpose for which all members of this Parliament have been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me turn to the person the Liberal Party has <span class="highlight">elected</span> as the Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the fact that the Liberal Party has <span class="highlight">elected</span> the new Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, a new Leader of the Liberal Party has been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and he is now the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the new Leader who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Liberal Parly, he has had more than 20 years experience in more portfolios than the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  today cared to take the time to recite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution provides that a parliament is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 3-year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cruising around his mind is the aphorism ‘Governments get defeated - Oppositions don’t get <span class="highlight">elected</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, the Liberal Party with our Australian Country Party colleagues, were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do this and, together, do it we will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that the Government, as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of Australia, has a responsibility to tell the Parliament, the wool growers and the taxpayers what it intends to do to save and to salvage this great Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, local government in South Australia is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a property franchise, and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> councillors consequently are concerned only with the defence and interests of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say that, in his opinion, it should be fully <span class="highlight">elected</span>, that it should have the right to govern and that it at least should have the right to the same ministerial responsibility as is given to some of the members of the New Guinea House of Assembly who have ministerial responsi bility? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When all is said and done he is only one of many, the voice of a Ministry <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a spoils-to-the-victor basis, and if he does not obey the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  in his every whim, irrespective of the effects on our rights in this Parliament, honourable members know as well as I do that he will be replaced almost overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a member of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, if he were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Commonwealth Parliament it is possible, though not certain, that he would need to resign from the Legislative Council to take his place in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although no specific debarment is included in the existing law, the Government believes it was never intended that a person should have the right to such dual nomination and this is borne out by the fact that when consenting to a nomination and to act if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the person nominated must declare that he is qualified under the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a senator, or as a member of the House of Representatives, as the case may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks to preserve the basis of democratic elections by ensuring that those <span class="highlight">elected</span> individually or as a government shall reflect the wishes of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clauses 10, 11 and 12 amend sections 133, 136 and 181a of the principal Act, being complementary to the introduction of first past the post voting under clause 9, and provide for informal votes, for the candidate with the highest number of votes to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and for the casting vote of the divisional returning officer to be made in the event of candidates receiving an equal number of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From 1901 until 1918 representatives to the Australian Parliament were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the simplest of all methods, namely, the first past the post system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was also said that it would give an absolute majority to the candidate <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal arguments advanced in support of preferential voting are, firstly, that it ensures that only a candidate who polls a majority of votes - that is more than 50 per cent - is <span class="highlight">elected</span>, thus reflecting the majority view and, secondly, that it gives a voter the exercise of a preference or second choice on the basis that voters are concerned with who will actually win, even if their first choice is rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This happened when the Communist Party preferences <span class="highlight">elected</span> the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  in the  1961  election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say that candidates and even governments are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by this type of voter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those who say that preferential voting is the only safeguard against the election of minority government, we have to accept the argument that every government <span class="highlight">elected</span> between 1901 and 1918 in Australia came under this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘First past the post’ voting is not the be all and end all of democratic elections, but by the introduction of one-vote-one-value and the introduction of this system it is reasonable to assume that governments <span class="highlight">elected</span> will be those chosen by the majority and not, as Malcolm McKerras described this Government, as ‘a second preference government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, from long experience I know that in many cases none of them could have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> except under that method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look briefly at the record of achievement that has occurred under this Government within the present electoral system which has <span class="highlight">elected</span> consistently for 22 years a government that has given stable government to the country and allowed for tremendous growth and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving that aside, I believe that when people, at the ballot box, clearly vote for a Party and give that Party a clear majority that is the Party that is entitled to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, it was way back in 1949, as 1 just said, that the Government parties, under the leadership of  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, told the people that, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, they would take steps immediately to abolish the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any single body can undertake a job of this kind and succeed it will be only because the parliaments of Australia have been prepared to subside their own interests, their own <span class="highlight">elected</span> duties and loyalties, to serve the political whim of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously this is what the Labor Party wants, because the Leader of the Opposition made the point that if Labor were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power it would negotiate a new financial agreement directly with local government, that is, from central government to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt, as one who has travelled an enormous amount in the course of the last 18 months, that the Governments of the smaller countries of South East Asia - and for that matter of Asia as a whole - which want to be independent would shudder at the thought that there was the prospect of the Labor Party being <span class="highlight">elected</span> as the government of this great country of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One difficulty is that under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act certain offences could not be indictable offences and to give a defendant the option of determining whether he should be dealt with summarily would mean that he could not be tried in any way if he <span class="highlight">elected</span> not to be so dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, are not the commercial terms laid down to the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Ceylon more onerous than those extended to Malaysia and Singapore in normal arms and ammunition supply transactions and so stringent as to make it unlikely that Ceylon can fulfil them and so obtain any assistance from Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a statement I made to this House on 27th April 1 indicated that the Government had accepted the Select Committee’s recommendations as adopted by the House of Assembly and I foreshadowed the early introduction of legislation to deal with those recommendations concerning a change in the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representation in the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time the House of Assembly consists of 94 members of whom 84 are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and 10 are official members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the nation will note that not one member of the Government Parties - I repeat, not one member - thinks this legislation brought into the House by their newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Prime Minister of sufficient importance even to speak on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  this only reflects the position that I have been driven into as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am on my feet for the very reason that I am asking, almost pleading, that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this Parliament - not just those whose votes support the Government - be given the right to bring matters before this House and to have those matters debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Summarising those recommendations, the report recommended that there be 18 persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to represent regional electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its recommendation that 100 members be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, it has reached the point that the Labor Party was suggesting when earlier legislation was before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much he may have been subsequently advised to moderate his stand since his first disastrous trip, the fact remains that Labor policy, as be stated it, was that, should the Labor Party be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972, Papua New Guinea would be made self-governing, whatever the people of Papua New Guinea thought, whatever fear, division and hopelessness it caused there, and whatever harm it did to Australia’s long term relationships with Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Government has supported the formation of a Select Committee of Constitutional Development with members drawn, not from the ranks of Labor Press secretaries or ex-Australian trade union organisers, but from indigenous and expatriate members of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of Papua New Guinea; people who live and work in the Territory; people who can speak the lan guage of the Territory and who, presumably, have some knowledge in depth of the customs and mores of the Territorians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Minister has recognised that there will almost inevitably be a number of changes amongst the peoples <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Assembly in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there is a real danger, I believe, of fragmentation of the Territory should selfgovernment come before either the <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislators or the Administration are ready for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To picture the McMahon Government as a big business government, as some of the 7 day wonders who got themselves <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place the year before last would maintain, rings as hollow as the copy of ‘Pravda’ where they read it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We certainly will not need to coerce the States to do anything of the sort, just as we will not have to coerce the private sector to do this because the private sector at this time, through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> industry and commerce representatives, is talking in the same terms as we are of the need for overall plans and a target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after 1 was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House I went to my colleague, the honourable member for Barton, together with a number of constituents, people interested in senior citizens centres, including a councillor, on a tour of the electorate of Barton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House I called a public meeting and explained to the people that there was a desperate need to provide these centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth assistance should be given to put this conference on a regular basis and to finance periodic meetings of an administrative council <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very good reason for having an Administrator’s Executive Council <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Ministers who are themselves selected, by a Parliamentary process of selection, by a committee of the House of Assembly which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the House of Assembly, and that that election should be subject to the confirmation of the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be 18 regional members <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, 82 open electorate members also <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, 3 members nominated by the House of Assembly for special purposes and 4 official members appointed by the Governor-General on the Administrator’s nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some of the regional electorate members have been inarticulate throughout the period they have been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the basic principle, which has been ignored, that if from a region representatives had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the national assembly there would be a very cohesive parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So these people should be given the opportunity now to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a regional basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The solution, in my view, is to get back to the regional concept, and from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> regional members get the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is just possible, too, that there are people in the community who are not attached to any of the parties, lt is just possible that they take seriously the fact that the Parliament is the repository, or is supposed to be the repository, of the people’s rights and so they go past the member, they go past the Party and they go direct to the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament of the nation sitting as a Parliament - to what has been called the grand constituency of all the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to think that we who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament would try to serve the people just a little more faithfuly, that we would try to see that the desires of the people were translated into legislative effect and that those people who have felt strongly enough on a subject to make a petition to the Parliament would receive a reply to their views, that their views would be considered and that the Parliament itself would discuss these matters in an informed way rather than adopt the present practice of allowing petitions to be received and to be passed to some dungeon to be stored or for something else to happen to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But let me say that from the Government’s point of view any person who is either appointed to a body or who might be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to it is expected after he becomes a member of that body to divorce himself from the responsibilities he previously exercised and to act thenceforth in accordance with the overall responsibilities which the new appointment places upon him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results of the elections gave no one party a majority in the 100 <span class="highlight">elected</span> member House of Assembly, but shortly before the opening of the House on 20th April the Pangu Party entered into a coalition with the People’s Progress Party, the New Guinea  National Party, the Mataungan Association group and a group of independents led by the former  Speaker, Dr John  Guise, to form a governing coalition group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that in the course of the election campaign the Prime Minister did give an assurance to the electorate in Tasmania that the Labor Party, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government, would do something positive about the disparity in shipping freight rates and the great difference demonstrated by a comparison between the cost of transporting goods a certain distance in the mainland States and the cost of transporting goods an equal distance between Tasmania and the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I trust that you treat that honour as highly as I do the honour of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an honour indeed for me to rise and speak tonight for the first time as the member for the electorate of Bendigo, particularly in the knowledge that I am the first Liberal Party member to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned previously that Bendigo was a city selected for accelerated development by the Victorian State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its election campaign the Australian Labor Party promised, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, to develop the AlburyWodonga complex as the first step in its concept of urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rose tonight to remind honourable members, if I might presume to do so, and particularly honourable members who have just been <span class="highlight">elected</span> into the Parliament on the other side of the House, of their responsibilities as I see them to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, having led unions, they have some responsibility to the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> them and should be able to exercise their influence over members of the unions if they were good enough to be selected to represent them in this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that country the Prime Minister is selected by the Party conferences, not by the parliamentary Party, and it is usually necessary for the Party to provide a seat in parliament for that member after he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader of the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, which now has the privilege of forming a Government in this Parliament, was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a policy and platform which was devised by consultations through all organs of the Party and by accepting advice from persons outside the Party who wished to make submissions to the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest or in any way indicate that this Government, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, should now repudiate its announced policies and the means by which those policies were evolved would be to suggest that the Government of the country could become dishonest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that any man who seeks his Party’s endorsement and stands for election on the policy of that Party and then seeks to repudiate in the Parliament the right of that Party to ask him to carry out the policies on which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> is a person not fitted to be a member of this or any other Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is abhorrent to our Party as it must be to all concerned Australians, and members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, too, if they made known what was really in their minds, that no group should have the power of direction over the people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with this the New South Wales Government removed from office without just cause, without consideration and without prior notice, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Hunter District Water Board and replaced them with ministerial appointees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had said since about 1953 that it was impossible to do away with the means test, notwithstanding that the Liberal and Country Parties, were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1949 on their promise to abolish the means test, but it found in 1972 that it was possible to abolish it and it did subsequently give some relief to the people who were being penalised by that means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number available for Liberal members who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the next election is so limited that the only solution will be that we will have to move to the side of the House on which the honourable member for Adelaide now sits and he will have to move back here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twenty-seven new members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament, mostly men under 45 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 16 new Labor members, 8 new Liberal members and 3 new Country Party members <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> us to Government, and turned out of office the Liberal-Country Party coalition they accepted a whole new range of ideals and ideas and of policies and objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who served a record term in this Parliament as  Deputy Speaker  and  Chairman  of Committees I know some of the responsibilities, joys, trials and tribulations of such a position and I am sure that the gentlemen who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to these 2 high offices have the good wishes of all honourable members in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not casting any doubts upon their right to do as they like, but I believe the people should ponder on these things and reflect on the type of government they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> and ask themselves: ‘Is this the type of example which should be set for my children by the supreme authority in this country?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I mention the stand-over tactics adopted by ALP organisations such as State councils and Federal conferences with regard to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, they tell the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members that they will do as they are told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is vital that a Labor Government be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 22nd February the Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  said that Australia’s growth rate was not sufficient to support the program on which the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, because it is the only body whose members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and can have their mandates withdrawn by all the people, so it is the Parliament which is the only democratic body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole essence of parliamentary government is that it is government of the people by the people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the older members will agree that it is the aim of most candidates when they stand for election to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> the process continues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Transport  (Mr Jones)  has indicated that he will make public the results of the study of the Bureau of Transport Economics, a matter which was referred to earlier by my colleague, the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> honourable member for Denison  (Mr Coates). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average person in the street - I hand this out as a pleasant warning at this stage - wonders who he is, why he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the position he holds and what his job is when he treats the Parliament of the nation in such a flippant fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the future he will do his job properly without seeing a necessity to buffoon and try to ridicule and belittle people, some of whom are perhaps not as adequately equipped as he is to stand up for their rights but simply are people sincerely trying to do a job which they have been sent by the people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> them to this Parliament to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is apposite at the moment to refer to the fact that Brisbane may now be 75 per cent sewered but when Alderman Clem Jones was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> Lord Mayor of Brisbane it was 40 per cent sewered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for years we have seen the spectacle of leading members of this Parliament - those who now sit on the Government benches - advocating rule by demonstration, rule by violent protest and in fact the circumvention of the democratic processes by which a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> and given a mandate to carry out its policies and by which the people can change that government if its actions no longer appeal to the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a promise to give the Legislative Council greater autonomy so that the people could have more say in their own affairs but the Government is legislating in this House without any reference to the Northern Territory Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It implied that somehow, magically, government would be made more open in supplying information and in sharing with the people - and surely with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people - the decision making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is worse, this Government has been guilty of a great deal of cavalier treatment and arrogance in its dealings with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> almost every Premier in Australia, irrespective of their politics, accepted the fact that the people of this country had expressed their will through the ballot box and that a Labor government bad been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am of the opinion that that measure and the Bill before the House confirm that the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government has a conscientious concern for the Aboriginal people and that it fully and unequivocally accepts the responsibility of giving the fullest opportunities to these people who have for so long been discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These 27 men who act as Ministers are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by their fellows, supported by their fellows and they jointly make decisions to help govern the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Ministry of the McMahon Government - which is no great credit - by reason of the fact that he complied with the requirement that you had to be very good and always bow to the Prime Minister and you were accordingly selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present Parliament resumed the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  selected him, I think, for a shadow Ministry, but subsequently the Liberal Party had a vote on who should be on the front bench and now the honourable member is back in the back blocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>horrible knowledge that the honourable member for Grayndler had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the economically powerless who <span class="highlight">elected</span> this Government to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government will ignore the proper claims of those people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> them to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We make no apologies for recommending to the Parliament and to the people of Australia that members of Parliament receive an adequate salary commensurate with the importance of the task they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The quality ot our national management is dependent on the quality of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have occurred only when the present holders of those positions were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three times the Prime Minister confirmed that fact and yet, in such a short time after being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the honourable members who support him have denied his own statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest it does because people are sent here - and this is the distinctive characteristic of this place - by the people, because they are <span class="highlight">elected</span>; they are sent by their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power to single out for privileged treatment the members of the unions which support it and traditionally contribute to election funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Half of the members in this House are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by people who do not even know the names of the members and if they saw them they surely would not vote for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It prevents this from happening by saying that there must be at least 5 members <span class="highlight">elected</span> in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members on both sides of the Parliament must face the electors, must fight to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a representative and must struggle to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the situation when this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it should be the responsibility of a House of Parliament to seek, to the extent that it is within its control, to ensure that persons who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament represent fairly equal numbers of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only basis upon which one can argue is that the Labor Party put this matter in its policy speech and was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on that policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that story had any substance, what about the honourable member for Riverina and his promise during the election campaign that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Party would make available $500m at an interest rate of 3 per cent per annum for loan purposes for primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 3rd August 1957 when the present Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Queensland- known popularly as Black Saturday - the now governing members were so surprised that they were not quite sure what to do for a while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many things that can be done to bring country people into closer contact with their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not much good anybody saying anything about what the previous Government promised, because my speech tonight has been concentrated wholly and solely on the promises of the Australian Labor Party, its members and its Leader when they were in Opposition and I have shown the lack of performance by this Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative is that the electoral rights of people of Australia are paramount and these must receive proper consideration if we are to suggest that the electoral system of this nation is a democratic one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will carry no weight with the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  and the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  or at least with the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> them on the last occasion but will think better of it on the next, because they know that they have now <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament a Government that is concerned only with votes in large cities and is not concerned with the remoter country towns, provincial cities or the people who live in the rural communities - not just the farmers but the totality of people who live outside the great metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government was in part <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a plank of open government which means allowing people within the Parliament to say what they feel they need to say, and making known to the people of Australia the various decisions of the Government and the background to those decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 4 weeks of this Parliament on only 2 or 3 occasions has the curtailment of a debate occurred and this was simply because members opposite were frustrating the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia, which has an overwhelming mandate to legislate in the interests of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, let me remind the House that this new Federal Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2nd December last, just 4 months ago last Monday, the day before yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of this House do not represent only those electors who voted for them or even just the electors; they also represent those who do not have the vote those migrants who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> not to take out Australian citizenship and the thousands of children too young to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any greater variation than 20 per cent would be in conflict with the constitutional requirement common to both Australia and the United States of America that members of the House of Representatives should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this approach to the problem of representation in this Parliament, as portrayed in this clause, is the only way in which a member can effectively discharge his responsibility and perform the functions for which he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only in this way also that the officers of the Public Service will be able to make sure that they translate into action the policy requirements of those <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the responsible task of governing the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When you were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office,  Mr Speaker,  I spoke briefly and said that I believed you were a man who could carry put the job, that you had displayed an understanding of Parliament during your manyyears here and that provided you dispensed justice without bias and impartially you would have the support of this side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that chairmen of House committees of this Parliament should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the committees themselves and not, as it were, by the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I can recall when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days the Government members <span class="highlight">elected</span> the  chairman  and the Opposition members the  Deputy Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as  chairman  but I do not believe that at that time had the  chairman  been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the nomination of the Prime Minister the Committee would have had the same  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of that Committee have now <span class="highlight">elected</span> the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie)  in his stead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Privileges Committee has not yet <span class="highlight">elected</span> its  chairman  but it has always been the practice of that Committee when a matter is referred to it to meet and elect one of its members as  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disappointment may have been because of Australian Labor Party promises to the Northern Territory concerning political and constitutional reform, back in the days of Arthur Calwell who referred to a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council having referred powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister visited the Northern Territory before the election he said that he saw future political independence in the Northern Territory as being part of its relationship with the Federal Parliament, but that this would only be defined after talks with local <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives if Labor won power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have mentioned only 3 of the 1 1 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thought that the idea was to work towards having a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say to the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Kerin)  that the Northern Territory has an <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature capable of setting up its own committees of inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Northern Territory Legislative Council has 11 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members - not enough - and 6 appointed official members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister will allow discussions to take place between the Government and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of that Council to enable further progress from where the previous Government left off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the fragmentation which has taken place since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been fiercely opposed, and rightly so, by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that because only the committee members - only the members who have worked together - know the value of the man who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> as  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should it be possible for an Australian who has <span class="highlight">elected</span> to live abroad almost permanently to be able to return to Australia for a little time and double his pension - get the 2 pensions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that meeting 12 people were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a committee but he did not ask one of them for an opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person who exercises management functions, or functions relating to the making, alteration or enforcement of rules, or who occupies a position with duties substantially the same as those of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> office, becomes the holder of an ‘office’ for the purpose of the Act and, subject to certain qualifications, will have to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that no officer <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file may be dismissed during his period of office unless he is guilty of misappropriation of union funds, a grave breach of rules or gross misbehaviour or gross neglect of duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also agree with what the Government proposes to do in regard to the question of the returnee - in other words those personnel who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to live outside of our country but who think that by returning to Australia for a short period, perhaps a few days, they could qualify for the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House he said to me: ‘You will get a lot of advice here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While some of the statistics he gave may be correct, as I understand the position it was the Premier of New South Wales who initiated the request for a special allocation of finance after the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general substance of the principle, as I understand it, is that a committee  chairman  should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the committee itself rather than nominated from outside of the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that this enticement, which could well have the effect of encouraging people into the Army, will allow the Government to keep its earlier promise to the people of Queensland that if it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2nd December it would station another battalion in Townsville in north Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To date the designation ‘Chief Minister’ has been an unofficial title that has given recognition to the position within the Papua New Guinea Ministry of the Minister <span class="highlight">elected</span> by his colleagues, to be  Deputy Chairman  of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a person is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament he is supposed to perform his functions as expeditiously as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, however, completely impractical and denies the right of properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> union officials to negotiate responsibly on behalf of union members who have entrusted them with that authority and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the first thing that the Minister would have sought to do with this legislation would have been to protect <span class="highlight">elected</span> union officers at the senior levels from the grass fires that can take place because of unwarranted and unjustifiable direct action by persons such as shop stewards taking the affairs of particular disputes into their own hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed amendment to the Act seeks to make some protection, and I believe it is very good protection, available to those people because if that protection does not exist we have the sort of situation which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and those he repre sents - those who employ - want, that is, a situation where they have a completely subservient work force in their factories and men and women who are disinclined to take any action or to complain about any action taken against them for fear that their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and they in turn would be dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He seems to overlook the fact - if he had had any practical experience of this he would know - that in all industrial matters the people on the job, the union members, will express their point of view, in fact have expressed their point of view, and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials, whether shop stewards or full time officials of the union are there to do the bidding of the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as the shop steward is concerned, we have to realise that this individual is democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relevant Act provides a procedure by which the people who represent the members of the union are <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a proper way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is in fact happening here is that legitimate protection is being given for properly and duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> officers of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action taken by a small number of people in the circumstances 1 have just described, people not <span class="highlight">elected</span> - 1 emphasise this - by the electors of Australia, would take out of the hands of the Government of this country the proper conduct of our national and international affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course there are 8 <span class="highlight">elected</span> Advisory Councillors for the Australian Capital Territory but these worthy members can do not more than advise the Minister in local matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, because a doubt exists about the matter, the Government considers that the wisest course is to defer the election of the additional member until the next general elections for the House of Representatives, particularly as separate legislation is being introduced to provide for 2 senators for the Australian Capital Territory to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> before that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister in presenting the Labor Party policy at the last Federal election made it clear that further representation would be given to the Territories if Labor were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not strange that there is not one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of either Territory in the Senate to expound the case for the local inhabitants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more democratic to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory thus following the pattern of the major parties providing that each would have a representative in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the substance of this matter is the same as that of matters that I have proposed for discussion in this Parliament for the 7 years immediately before this new Govern’ ment was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the potential ability of local government to provide for the immediate access of directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives to a community which gives it this democratic quality once described by Harold Laski as *the genius of place’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 25 October 1972, in an address to the annual conference of the Local Government Association of New South Wales in Canberra, the Prime Minister referred again to the way in which he, if <span class="highlight">elected</span>, was proposing to get finance to the assistance of local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course we have the occasional situation in which a particular policy that is mentioned in a policy speech or made an issue in an election campaign is so much in the forefront of things, is so vital an issue and the parties are so much in conflict about it, that the party which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> can truly be said to have a mandate to carry out that policy which it espoused during the election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is one of a number of important issues which were put before the Australian people and I think it is fair to say that the Australian people would be entitled to expect this Government to carry out its promise when <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, having said that and given that warning as to the possible implications of this Bill, I come back to the point that I believe that councils and the Australian people are entitled to expect funds as a result of the promises that were given to them by the Government which they <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, while I was Attorney-General, I sought to devise a scheme by which this could be done and I presented a paper in which, with some variation of what had been proposed in 1959 by the Committee, a scheme was propounded which would make it possible for senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for about 6 years - 2 successive House of Representatives terms - still being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in succession, overlapping each other, and so that always, the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives would be synchronised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reminded that as long ago as 1970 the then Prime Minister spoke during a by-election in which 1 was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House in support of the proposition that the size of the Australian Capital Territory was such - I quote him loosely because I do not have his exact words in front of me - that it either was or shortly would be ready for increased representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple truth of the matter is that the honourable gentleman asked in his speech - honourable members will recall the dulcet language in which he asked this question - ‘Is it not strange that there is not one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of either Territory in the Senate to expound the case for the local inhabitants?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard of the promises that the Australian Labor Party would move more quickly than the former Government to give the people of the Northern Territory a greater interest in their own affairs and that an immediate move would be made for the Northern Territory to be controlled by a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Minister has been in charge of the Department of the Northern Territory, instead of moving towards a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council he has removed 3 government members from the Council but has replaced them with 3 other government members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the word ‘extent’ properly refers to the numbers and that the word ‘terms’ probably refers to the length of the term for which members are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that the conferring of the right to vote in this House on the member of the Northern Territory when it was done in mid-term and not as a condition of the election in which he was originally <span class="highlight">elected</span> was one of the most disgraceful episodes in the electoral history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister is going to a very considerable length to see that union officials are properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> - democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> - by their unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not seem to be consistent to take this step and then to take all negotiating authority and capacity away from those same properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many unions and unionists who, having democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> their officials, are prepared to support them through to a conclusion on any difficult negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the Opposition has to remember that we are the Government and we have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office on a program to bring about better industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We may be wrong in what we think ought to be done to the Act, but as the newly-<span class="highlight">elected</span> Government we are entitled to be given the opportunity of trying to see whether what we believe to be right is the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Special Committee endorses the view that the House of Assembly, as the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of Papua New Guinea, in consultation with the administering Power, should decide the date for the attainment of independence of the Territory in the light of General Assembly resolution 2977 (XXVII) of 14 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is, may I ask if he has yet received permission for himself or his officers to visit Yam Island in the Torres Strait Group, the <span class="highlight">elected</span>  chairman  of which stated that he was not prepared to accept an offer of money on behalf of his people in return for allowing the Minister or his departmental officers to visit the island as the opportunity arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate election in the several States or at the same time as the next general election for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate election: that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it would be proper to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory, thus allowing representation of the parties to be more evenly balanced than would be the case if only one senator for each Territory was provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not think that in a House of 125 members, with the closeness of the contest at election time and the narrow margins by which governments are often <span class="highlight">elected</span>, a solution of that type - the giving away of one seat - is one which any political party in this place will easily accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is interesting to note that in most countries - I had reason to learn this at some close quarters when I was at the ‘United Nations - the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people move to Washington, to Delhi, to London holus bolus and stay there during the period of the sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there have been great changes since I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place and, as I have said, they have been for the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact one would feel that they could so develop that honourable members would spend so much time in Canberra that they would forget to go home to their electorate and be re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, for a private member to keep in contact with the people and offer service to the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> him to be their representative with the assistance of one staff member is impossible for any member who is intent on doing his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tariff Board was established in 1921 and it has been an important and respected source of advice to 21 of the 28 Parliaments which have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> since federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of the 2 senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the Northern Territory, Government supporters might imagine that they could win one seat so they would be prepared, on those figures, to give one away in order to get three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the House wants the senators representing the Territories to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 3-year terms or for terms which would coincide with House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, their senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a full 6-year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that Senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> for longer periods can create some check on the rashness and extravagance of Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for only 3 years and will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a House where people are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a proportional representation basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party could get them all I find it hard to understand why the leading spokesman for that Party said that although, with 2 senators being <span class="highlight">elected</span> at one time on a proportional representation basis, his Party would require only 33 per cent of the vote plus one to get a senator <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the Australian Labor Party would get the 2 senators for the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Territory would be sitting alongside those <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact when I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House I received more than 50 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Northern Development informed him that if there was a Labor Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Northern Territory would get statehood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there was a genuine attempt on the part of the former Government to transfer executive responsibility across to the Northern Territory and to have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more democratic to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory thus following the pattern of the major parties providing that each would have a representative in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the legal terms used by the honourable member for Stirling, Territory senators, when <span class="highlight">elected</span>, will have equal rights with other senators in voting and in respect of everything else associated with Senate membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume the reason for it was specifically to cover the position of  Mr Tom  .Roper, who was a member of the Interim Committee of the Social Welfare Commission and who after joining the Interim Committee was <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a member of the Victorian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have just listened to the typical, whining, whingeing, moaning and bellyaching type of speech we have heard from the Country Party goats since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the people of Australia should have been informed that a social welfare commission would be established if the Australian Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, because this would have indicated that another government department would be established entailing the appointment of the head of the department,  deputy  heads and various other personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party gives the right to every member who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to come to this Parliament and who has to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament to support the Government have only the right to elect the Prime Minister and have no right whatever to question any decision of the Cabinet let alone take part in a debate on, and possibly reject, a decision of the Cabinet in the Party room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a democracy such as ours, if there is a conflict between a duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Minister and his departmental head it should not be the Minister who is replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one other thing that I wish to say: If there is to be a situation in which a Minister is appointed to this very difficult portfolio, whoever that Minister may be or may have been - and I go back beyond the honourable member for Wills - and a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> person who disagrees with the decisions of the responsible Minister takes the opportunity to bypass him and, without that Minister’s knowledge, even goes to a Prime Minister and has overthrown the decisions of the Minister responsible, then so long as that situation continues the parliamentary approach will be derogated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>, But let us look at the whole issue of the Brisbane airport which has suddenly come to life after the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Doyle)  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament and started to take an interest in the airport by way of questions, letters and meetings in the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, which is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a basically equal franchise, is not the House of government - the House of Representatives is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No party can guarantee or expect to have a majority in the Senate because of the manner in which its members are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Approximately half of the members of the Senate were <span class="highlight">elected</span> when Harold Holt was Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will know that an important program we have embarked upon is the creation of a nationally <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 12 December 1972, before the Cabinet had been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  who then had the responsibility, appointed an Interim Committee for an Australian Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who sees the Schools Commission as a single identity without relating it to the other magnificent work the Minister for Education has done or without seeing it in relation to the overall program for which this Government was so overwhelmingly <span class="highlight">elected</span>, fails to see the inter-relationship between education and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government from time to time <span class="highlight">elected</span>, is the most effective voice of the Australian people and sometimes the only one they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persons who want this type of housing from the housing commissions or housing trusts in the States have had to wait 23 years for a Federal Labor Government to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and to provide this type of provision to meet their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Parliament can survive only if the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent the Australian people are given a reasonable opportunity of expressing a point of view on legislation which materially affects every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no denying that they are forgetting all about those who <span class="highlight">elected</span> them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ultimate effect of this bureaucratisation must be a dispersal of power away from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people to organisations whose links may be very direct with the Government but very tenuous with the Parliament and therefore with the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and governments are broken, but the government is only the vehicle by which people express their point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a government, freely and properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, having control of the assets of the coutnry for the benefit of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to the taxation concessions mentioned by the Leader of the Country Party, I would say to the honourable member for Leichhardt that there is no merit at all in giving taxation concessions to foreign multi-national corporations which donate to political campaign funds, as they have no right to provide finance for the defeat of a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy upon which the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the last election included a plank on Aboriginal affairs and that plank remains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> its Aboriginal Affairs Committee in conjunction with the Minister carried out over a period a survey reviewing public expenditure in order to develop guidelines which would ensure that the principles to which I referred were followed while the Aboriginal people were given the necessary support to enable them to spend money wisely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will find that my arithmetic is much better than it was before and a lot beter than his when he said that no Country Party member had ever been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament on first preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a party platform which had been framed in this regard in July 1971 and on a policy speech which I delivered last November, committed to the proposition that local government in each State should have a voice and a vote on the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newly <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of the Exchange said that it was time to convince the investing public that the Stock Exchange had to take real strides to restore the confidence of the small investor in the operation of the Stock Exchange, and that many questionable mining stocks had been brought before the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being asked to approve the creation of a situation in which the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, will be bound - not simply permitted, but bound - to seek the advice and the recommendations of a statutory organisation before it can make decisions on assistance for industry; not just temporary arrangements but permanent policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Questions of the most vital concern to people are going to be decided, not by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of those people, but by a body not responsible to the people - a body set up by a Government which is not prepared to shoulder the responsibilities which should be its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless I say that this House should reject this Bill because the proposal it embodies will reduce the standing and authority of the Parliament; it will remove from the Government and the Parliament responsibilities which should be theirs, and it will place those responsibilities in the hands of an extremely powerful central planning authority which I believe will not have the capacity to make the kinds of decisions which will be in the interests of the majority of the Australian people - the kinds of decisions which only <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments can and should make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, on this very topical issue of what the Government has done to primary industry since it came to power, I cannot emphasise too strongly that had this Commission been in existence when this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> the rape of the rural sector which has taken place since 2 December would have been impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Parliament, the Government, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people will not be those who will determine which industries of this country will be assisted nor in what way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From memory, not one member of the Country Party has ever won more than SO per cent of the primary votes before being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A couple of years ago he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 27 per cent of the primary vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place in 1959 I came with a main interest in tariffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House and helped to shoulder some of the burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard the Government as being the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, and consequently the Government should be prepared to exercise the responsibility accorded to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a major bureaucratic organisation operating outside direct democratic responsibility to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the Australian Government, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, the responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Politics is concerned with socio-economics and I refuse to accept that bureaucrats can make these sorts of decisions which should be the combined judgment of <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Parliament or of the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence that was accepted came from the members of this Parliament who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government merely continues along its bumbling and arrogant way, caring nothing for the welfare of the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament assembled; the Address-in-Reply debate took place; the members were sworn in; the  Speaker  was <span class="highlight">elected</span>; the  Deputy Speaker  was <span class="highlight">elected</span>; the Ministry and ministerial changes were announced; the Whips were <span class="highlight">elected</span>; there were condolence motions; the committee to prepare the Address-in-Reply - that Government knew when its speakers spoke for only 2i minutes that they were not too bright - was <span class="highlight">elected</span>; the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply was moved and seconded; and then, like bats out of hell, Government supporters ran out to the GovernorGeneral and at 5.45 p.m. gave him the 2-minute Address. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the right honourable member for Higgins indicated in that speech that if honourable members frustrate the will of the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government they must expect to have their efforts curtailed by the use of, as it is popularly called in this place, the gag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People come to visit this place; they own it; we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by them, and yet there were signs ‘Strangers not admitted into the lobbies’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Government when they were in Opposition last year making a regular practice when they were abroad of criticising the Australian Government and, ipso facto, the Australian people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Karmel Committee is enshrined in a schools commission and in legislation with a major policy commitment by a one-Party Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a Federal election does not cut any ice at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, I make it very clear that I take great pride in being a supporter of a Government which, immediately upon being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, commissoned the Karmel report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only point I seek to make is that if the Labor Party goes to the people and its policy speech is delivered by its leaders, members of that Party have a nerve if, after being <span class="highlight">elected</span>, they do not allow the promises contained therein to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be consistent, they had better say where they will cut Government spending if they are re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Upper House is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a fancy franchise, is only a House of Review and has no power to deny Supply, morally or historically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Almost the majority of the Opposition’s representation has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> not on No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was three and a half years before I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man who was responsible for this is the honourable member for Lilley, who was recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not the slightest doubt exists in my mind that, if they were ever re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> to government, they would throw the whole wheat agreement into jeopardy <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that a Liberal government - if ever <span class="highlight">elected</span> - would treat Taiwan as a separate, independent government, separate from China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is found that these matters are being handled in that way and that no regard is being had to decisions of democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government, and if speculators can go their own merry way without getting approval from the local planning authorities, it is time that the Housing Commission and other authorities took up all land development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest to honourable members opposite that they should conduct themselves in accordance with the Standing Orders of this Parliament and in a manner befitting the dignity of a member of Parliament and not behave like a lot of under-educated larrikins in a place where they are expected to show some respect for the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> them to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate will not change its vote, the Senate which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> next year will do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is purely a transitional arrangement designed to adjust to the new system the terms of those existing senators whose terms expire on 30 June 1977 and the terms of those who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the forthcoming Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, a senator <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the forthcoming Senate elections for service from 1 July 1974 will have a term running until the 1981 House of Representatives election - again unless there is a double dissolution or earlier election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean, in normal circumstances and, of course, excluding any senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> to fill casual vacancies, that the senators serving when the constitutional alteration becomes law could have a term of up to about  7i  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should add that when a double dissolution occurs under the new arrangement, the senators then <span class="highlight">elected</span> will be divided by the Senate into 2 classes as at present, but their terms will be equal to 2 House of Representatives terms in the one case and one House of Representatives term in the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also said that the Government would want to include a provision that the State Houses of Parliament be <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in those States with Upper Houses <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people very large inequalities exist as the following examples show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Upper House is <span class="highlight">elected</span> not by the people but by the existing members of the 2 Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also proposes an amendment of the Constitution so that each House of each State Parliament will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the amendment will require New South Wales to alter the voting system for its Legislative Council so that all of its members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the ordinary voters of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government should have both a voice and a vote in the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other was that the Australian Government be empowered to borrow on behalf of <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is to grant financial assistance only to <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Who are these builders labourers that they shall dictate what jobs shall go on and what jobs shall not and defy the proper <span class="highlight">elected</span> authorities of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, not losing any time, this chap scurried down and then obviously offered from the Country Party’s coffers and slush funds $1,500 or $1,000 whichever he thought the Labor Party would be prepared to accept by way of a bribe to give its preferences to the Country Party in an endeavour to beat  Mrs Millen,  the legitimately <span class="highlight">elected</span> Liberal Party member for the State seat of Murray who was returned at the last election for that seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that the purpose of laying a White Paper on the table is to allow interested organisations to comment on it, to put their views forward through the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members on both sides of the Parliament so that the Minister and his advisers can consider constructive criticisms when drafting the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power has moved from <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons to unelected persons inasmuch as this platform here, the Parliament, no longer matters, and instead this tremendously elevated platform is being used by unelected persons who can use it to express their own biased views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a referendum of this kind is to be put to the people surely the Parliament, of all places, is where there should be discussion on the issues to be raised in the referendum; that is, unless one takes the view that Parliament does not matter at all and that the views of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people are of no consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consequential elections were held on 28 April 1951 and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the terms of the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators were taken to have begun on 1 July 1950. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The back-dating of the term of service necessitated further Senate elections before 30 June 1953 whereas the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the House of Representatives began their 3-year term from the date of the election - that is as from 28 April 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Voters would know the choice before them - the election of a government - and could be more confident that the government so <span class="highlight">elected</span> could effectively carry out its mandate, while political parties would be able better to plan their campaigns and formulate policies for government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Separate elections do not, in practice, affect the formation of governments, but often they lead to situations where the government in the lower House the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government at that time is frustrated by an oppositionheld senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not conducive to sound government that the future of a recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> government should depend upon eventualities of elections for senators which take place during the normal life of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that instead of holding a referendum to provide for both Houses to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> together, we simply go out to the Governor-General and invite him to allow us to have the elections of the House of Representatives with the Senate elections.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, the Constitution will be strengthened, for capricious government, which can be brought about by a Senate’s rejecting legislation that has been passed by an <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Representatives, can have the effect of lowering the respect in which the public holds the Parliament and the legislative process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the reason for this recommendation is that a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the will of the people on its policies could effectively and efficiently carry out those policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assume that the only reason the 2 Houses in Canada do not come out conjointly is that the Senate is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for life, the House of Commons every 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier I referred to the methods adopted in countries which have bicameral systems of Parliament where both Houses are <span class="highlight">elected</span> conjointly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From listening to the prophets of doom on the other side it is quite clear that bicameral systems, if both Houses are <span class="highlight">elected</span> conjointly, work effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any government that is worth its salt can certainly prune its legislation to meet the circumstances of an upper House, particularly an upper House, might I add in the 30 seconds left to me, that is different from, say, the upper House in the New South Wales ParliamentI am not going to debate it in that it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a mandate really means, in the broad, is that if a party is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government it can implement the broad policies of that party - not every little issue that it has put up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A curious result of this is that the Government is alleging that it was not democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> and that by the amendment of the Constitution there will be henceforth democratic elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>any member of the other place who would seriously assert that the House of Representatives or the Senate is not directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is an assertion that the Government was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is putting the proposition that it was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it wants to amend the Constitution to make sure in the future it will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also an assertion that there is not a single State Parliament that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 24 of the Constitution really intends that, subject to each State of the Commonwealth having a minimum of 5 members, the members <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each State shall be in proportion to the number of persons resident in the particular State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of logic to suggest that, having determined that the number of members <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each State should be determined by equal value of votes, the electoral divisions within the States should be determined on a different basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must seem odd, even to a layman, that the Prime Minister feels it is open to him to initiate action which he intends should lead to the States being told by him in effect how their Parliaments should be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here is a Party one of the members of which, sitting in the back, the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Hewson),  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 16.63 per cent of the primary votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until quite recently the Upper House of the South Australian Parliament was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by means of a restricted franchise and, even today, the Legislative Council of the New South Wales Parliament is <span class="highlight">elected</span> indirectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, even if the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales were willing to reform itself and institute a more equitable distribution - the signs, of course, are that the lower House is certainly not willing to do so - any such proposals would need to be accepted by the indirectly <span class="highlight">elected</span> upper House - the Legislative Council of the New South Wales Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This upper House, which is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, is in a position to frustrate the will of the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister said in his second-reading speech it is designed to seek approval for ‘an amendment of the Constitution which would write into it the principle of substantial equality of electoral divisions for all the Parliaments of Australia and a provision that the State Houses of Parliament be <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Question time in Parliament was designed to allow members of both the Government and the Opposition to obtain information which they consider vital to the efficient performance of their duties as <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it fair to say that until the Prime Minister tells us about the staffing arrangements of Ministers, which he has promised this Parliament to do but has not done, the people of Australia are entitled to know who these faceless men are who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people but who cover up for Ministers in every way possible at huge public expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> one of the first things which the then Country Party Whip, who was giving the new members a rundown on what we were permitted to do, did was to warn us against casting reflections- on a member’s ability to carry on effectively because he was under the influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government’s approach to local government is quite clear from the fact that we so early sponsored amendments to the Grants Commission Act and also the fact that we are sponsoring referendums next year coincidental with the Senate election or other elections at that time, and one of them will make it possible for the Australian Government to deal directly with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies as regards both outright grants of money and also grants which are repayable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time it has been carrying out the policies that it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the last election, several Government supporters in Tasmania continually stressed that if they were in government the grower representatives to the statutory marketing authority, which they had outlined would be established under their government, would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the growers themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some points in this legislation that I am not happy about and one is the fact that the members of the Corporation are to be appointed, not <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Corangamite mentioned, the growers in the industry were told by the Labor Party spokesmen before the general election that they believed in <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, I turn to the matter of having <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of growers on the Corporation as promised by a Labor spokesman prior to the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From listening to the honourable member, I believe that the people whom the Minister will appoint as growers’ representatives may not be growers whose names appear on the list as being having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the growers’ section of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only four of the 9 members of the Corporation will be grower representatives, and they may not even be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that from the time this Federal Labor Government was democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia, the backward Premier of Queensland has done nothing but attack it and make statements saying that he would not support any measures which come from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of policies which were developed carefully, steadily and intelligently to meet the important demands of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to carry out this health program, in the same way as it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to provide equality of opportunity in education, to come to terms with the problems of our cities and to deal with other long neglected national problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these circumstances, whatever the Standing Orders are at the moment, they should be suspended to allow the Prime Minister to stand in this House and tell the people’s <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives the way in which action will be taken immediately to stop wrong expenditure and to make sure that in future all expenditure is according to law and according to the proper regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one has regard to their performance and to their approach one must realise that they could not win a majority of the votes because the majority of people are more sensible than to elect Country Party members because they know they are the types of people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> only because boundaries are gerrymandered and rigged to their advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only do we seek a constitutional guarantee that State Houses of Parliament shall be directly <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, but also it is proposed to guarantee the suffrage in State elections to Australian citizens on terms and conditions analogous to those operating for electors to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the other chamber, which is controlled by the Liberal and Country parties, the Australian Democratic Labor Party and a few Independents - not the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government - the legislation was thrown back and tonight and this afternoon we hear these great protectors of liberty now saying that this Parliament is being destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House of Representatives, being <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 3-year or shorter period must of necessity be constantly looking towards the next election whereas the senators with a longer span are able to make a more balanced approach to legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reducing the Senate to a duplicate and having senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the same period of office as members of the House of Representatives would mean that the Senate would serve no useful purpose at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe - and we have said for the last 10 years, since the United States Supreme Court, the Warren Court, first laid down this interpretation - that it ought to be put in the Constitution so that <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons can no longer disregard this proper democratic principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the honourable member for Cowper  (Mr Ian Robinson),  the previous  speaker,  was more concerned with being in his electorate than he was with sitting in the national House of Parliament, which he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On construing sections 135 and 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act it would appear to me that new senators will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> one by one with the declaration of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Looking at section 135 (5) (c) and section 141 (1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, it seems to me that senators can be declared <span class="highlight">elected</span> one by one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable gentleman knows quite well that on some occasions it is possible for his colleagues or his confederates in the Senate to prevent the will of the majority of the members <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the most recent Federal election, that it is possible for senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1967 and in December 1970 to frustrate the will of the people expressed in the election of the House of Representatives in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind the honourable member for North Sydney who now shows mock concern for the Australian public servant that the other great thing that his Government did for the public servants in the field of superannuation was to introduce one of the most inequitable schemes imaginable - the socalled non-contributory unit which was available only to those who <span class="highlight">elected</span> to retire at age 65 and those who for one reason or another found it necessary to retire at age 60 and had to fix their pension on that basis were denied any benefit from that so-called and much vaunted improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition cannot permit these successes to continue so it resorts to blocking the Government in the Senate and using its numbers in a House that was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the time that the people of Australia believed they were electing an Australian Government - December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the so-called delay at that time is nothing like the delay of the present Government and the present Commissioners because he should have moved much more quickly and sooner than 23 May 1973, which was some 6 months after the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972, to set in motion the machinery to bring about the redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the situation is that even had the Government brought in the redistribution the day after it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office the situation would not have changed until the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were not ali possessed of the prescience that there would be an election within less than 12 months: The normal assumption of one who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 3 years is that he will carry on for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appropriate procedures for the Division of the Australian Capital Territory into 2 areas have been in train for some time but, because of the unprecedented threat made by the Opposition to deny Supply to a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, it may be necessary to hold a general election for this House before the Committee has completed its task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been endorsed in this House but people in another place, <span class="highlight">elected</span> as long ago as 1967 in some cases, have seen fit to reject them despite the fact that the Australian Government, in  Her  Majesty’s own words, ‘has a mandate’ for this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Senate are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is seeking to deny the Australian people an opportunity which is their entitlement - an opportunity for their <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government to give effect to the legislative obligations which it has, following a sweeping victory in a general election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, honourable gentlemen opposite are interjecting as I contend that there has been obstruction in the other place and as I contend that the standard bearers <span class="highlight">elected</span> back in 1967 are still trying to rule the roost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because all over this country today Liberal and Country Party organisers - the bigwigs of business and industry - are standing over members of the Country Party and the Liberal side in another place seeking to get their vote to stop supply and to defeat this duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and his Party are committed to increase the price of petrol as soon as they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never in the history of the Australian Parliament extending over 73 years has any Opposition threatened to withhold Supply from a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already in another place we find that the Opposition has been ruthless and so reckless in the utilisation of its brutal majority that in 13 days from 28 February to 4 April it has carried 35 divisions and allowed the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of the day to carry only one division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members need to remember that there is no analogy between the Australian Senate - properly and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by all the people of Australia - and a hereditary House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what he thinks of democracy; that is what he thinks of this Parliament; that is the contempt he shows for the <span class="highlight">elected</span> institutions in Australia which alone stand between the Australian people and a wretched Government which will stand condemned in five or six weeks time unless the Prime Minister turns tail and runs again as he did last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great derelictions of this particular Government is that it has forgotten that it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to be the servants of the people it presumes to lead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Progressive legislation that this Government has passed has been in the face of deliberate, blatant, frustrating tactics from the Opposition majority in the Senate, who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> almost 3 years and 5 years before this Government’s policies were endorsed by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that majority who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> 3 and 5 years ago - let us examine those in particular who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> 5 years ago - are a number of senators whose term of office expires in a matter of a few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Griffith has been in this House for 7 years and, on his own admission, he had not made one speech in respect of the Brisbane Airport until the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took him almost 12 months after the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to discover suddenly that we had an airport in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would compare my record of attendance in this House since I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with that of the honourable member for Petrie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people want to make comparisons between the representation by the various <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, I will stand before the people of Lilley and tell them that I have been present at every session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pointing out that during the 16 months that I have been the honourable member for Lilley considerable amounts of money have been allocated to and expended on the Brisbane Airport development and I have played my part in this regard in representing the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They knew that they could stand in the way of worthwhile social reform, a major issue on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> and for which we have a mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recommended the majority of members of Boards of Directors of all funds should be democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the contributors and that full public disclosure of accounts is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to know whether they will continue to have security of employment and whether their sons are going to be conscripted if by any mischance the Opposition were re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Liberal Party favours the present situation in which the directors of funds are not democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the contributors but continue to be nominated by people who represent basically not consumer groups but hospital organisations and the Australian Medical Association and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in an unprecedented position because a strongly supported Government, <span class="highlight">elected</span> with a clear mandate, faces termination of office by a Senate with no mandate at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government they <span class="highlight">elected</span> has never been given a chance to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who should be accused of immorality are those who refused to accept the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government of December 1972, those who have become inflated with power for 20 years previously, and those who set out to obstruct and hinder the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia in every possible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if a Liberal- Country Party Government were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament it would be prepared to hurt people to try to deal with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the sake of political gain they seek to destroy every vestige of democracy in this country and to throw out the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government for sheer political power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there are people who sit in the other place who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> years ago and who seek to bring down this Government for reasons which the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  mentioned are completely contrary to every democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When was it democratic theory that the people should have no opportunity, when the Parliament gave them that opportunity, to have another look at a government which had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> democratically? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are extraordinarily fortunate that this is a country which has a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> lower House and a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> upper House, that it has no House of Lords and that there is an opportunity for the people, where there is a basic and real impasse in the government of the country, to be given another chance to have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relies, as we do at the moment, on a Senate not <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of population but purely on the basis of area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 12 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members in the Senate, and most of those senators are, in fact, <span class="highlight">elected</span> because of the general voting trends in the States they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a House where half of the present members were <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a policy of sending conscripts to Vietnam - one wonders how irrelevant to contemporary politics such a situation could be - people are prepared to assume responsibility for the financial authority of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a story were to read: ‘Once upon a time a member of a newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government won a seat by 35 votes and then that government, at a time of desperation, took action to try to save that seat’ - we would have the key to the successful initiation of this Brisbane Airport project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About ten or eleven months after the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> he suddenly became aware that Brisbane had an airport and he made a few speeches, not that there was much substance in what he said, on the subject during adjournment debates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before being <span class="highlight">elected</span> as member for Adelaide in 1958, he had been Assistant SecretaryTreasurer of the Building Workers Industrial Union of South Australia in the years 1950 to 1952, then organiser of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1953 he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> Secretary of the South Australian Branch of the Party, a redoubtable training ground for parliamentarians, his predecessor being  Senator Toohey  and his successors, the honourable member for Bonython  (Mr Nicholls),  the South Australian Minister for Transport, and the new honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One expects him to be a man of that character because in 1967 he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Corio, an area renowned for sound judgment, discernment and discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in his parliamentary service, <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber as he was initially by a by-election on 22 March 1952, and in his subsequent effective membership of this chamber he has demonstrated a knowledge and a capacity which I believe of itself alone qualifies him for the appointment which this House is now considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock)  on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> again as  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that the honourable member for Corio too has a knowledge of the Standing Orders of this chamber and has done his best in the circumstances when he has been in control of the chamber; but the position,  Mr Speaker,  is that he who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> serves first as your  deputy  and secondly as the  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the co-operation would be the same no matter from which party the  Chairman  of Committees was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, but, this friendship, this co-operation, this liaison between the principal officer of the Parliament, the  Speaker,  and his  deputy,  the  Chairman  of Committees, is very important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Scholes  is declared <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  it is just 7 years this month since the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with very great pleasure that I, for the second time, congratulate him on being <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I congratulate the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the House as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  on being <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a smile on his face now, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really do not think that one is <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees to be a comedian; I think one is <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Chairman  of Committees to conduct the affairs of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the honourable member will be praying for it to stop so that there might be the kind of conditions that members opposite hope might get them <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the first point that I make is that I do not believe that the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  realises how necessary it is, if matters such as these are to be considered effectively, that those who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House following the last election should have the chance to debate these pieces of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, I do not believe it is reasonable to expect that the people of Australia and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this House would be content to believe that there could be adequate debate of the legislation which is before us in the time proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the Australian people should recognise that a party which is supposedly dedicated to the abolition of the Senate - for that is what its policy says - is forcing debate of these piece of legislation from this, the principal <span class="highlight">elected</span> chamber of the Parliament, into the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more just to have an even number <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time for each Territory, thus allowing the representation of the parties to be more evenly balanced than would be the case if only one senator for each Territory were provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill, after the first election of Territory senators, both senators for each Territory will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> each time there is a general election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, given the propensity that this Government has for allowing full and adequate debate in the Senate it could well be that, if we were to pass this piece of legislation, the situation could develop whereby those -who are senators or part-senators from the Territories would have a greater opportunity to discuss significant pieces of legislation affecting the wellbeing of the Australian people than those who are their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, what the Labor Party is seeking to do is to have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate people who will not be given the same opportunity to express a point of view as other senators because they are to be constricted in their voting rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, 2 senators will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each territory and the basis of their election will be proportional representation for 3-year terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a new Parliament with 17 new members in this House - democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> by more than 500,000 people on 18 May - who will be denied the opportunity to debate this fantastically important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to remind him that this is a House of Parliament democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> and by this tactic the Government is denying the rights of every member of this House, including the 17 new ones, to talk about an issue that affects every Australian now living and every Australian to be born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are told - not only members on this side of the House but also the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Labor Party members - like little children in primary school that we must conclude all our arguments on this momentous issue in just 2 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with these aspects, I am conscious that I am repeating some of the arguments made by myself and other speakers in the December debate but, unlike the Government, we recognise that this is a new Parliament and that there are <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people here who have not necessarily heard those arguments or been allowed to participate in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when we talk about adequate parliamentary debate we are talking about discussion sufficient to air the issues, discussion sufficient to clarify any issues which require clarification for the public, and discussion adequate to allow the topic before the House to go into the community as well so that some feedback can come to <span class="highlight">elected</span> members in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it will not dawn on the Leader of the Opposition that that is the case he can be shown only when he puts up motions like this and they are defeated by the vote of the majority <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had handed to me by the Federal  President  of the Australian Medical Association this afternoon what I would describe as an ultimatum on behalf of most of the private practice doctors in the Australian Capital Territory, not acting as a union on behalf of people who are negotiating conditions of employment but as a body delivering an ultimatum saying that they refuse the right of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of this country or indeed any authority in the Australian Capital Territory to increase the public sector of health care in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972, and more especially since the beginning of this year, home seekers and the housing industry generally have come under direct attack as a result of this Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory consisting of 19 members to replace the present Legislative Council comprised of 1 1 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members and 6 official members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council unanimously favour a Legislative Assembly of 19 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Administrator’s Council consists of 2 official members and 3 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members; and clause 16 provides, inter alia, for the continuation of ordinances in force at the time the Legislative Assembly is constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent events affecting the operation of this Parliament have made it necessary for the Government to proceed with this Bill as a matter of priority in these sittings so that elections might be held on that date and the Government’s undertaking to give the people of the Northern Territory a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature by the end of this year, might be kept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: ‘What more important matter can any Minister have than to be present and hear the debate in the national Parliament by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if ever a Government put forward strongly the view that it would increase foreign aid and drew attention to the needs of other countries and the capacity of Australia to increase foreign aid, it was this Government when it was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To think that any member would deny the rights of a fellow <span class="highlight">elected</span> member to put a point of view would always be beyond me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier in the year he announced that a 19-man Legislative Assembly would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> later in the year, ft also will take away the importance of the decisions to be made by this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The timing of the introduction of that Bill into the House - which will ensure that members will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 24 October so that there can be a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly before the end of December this year - hinged on the statement of policy that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made off the top of his head that that would be so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who knows anything about the Northern Territory knows that that date for having a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly - by that 1 mean one with executive authority and not just 19 men milling around the Assembly chamber with no policy, no leadership, no means of introducing government business, no means of asking questions and no government member in there at all - makes a farce of the Committee and of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt there are thoughts of it but the Assembly will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 24 October and no one will really know which way they are going or what will be run by whom in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we did recommend in October that the Legislative Council be enlarged, that it be a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Council and that it have executive responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am pleased to see that in the Australian Capital Territory, for instance, there are moves towards embodying executive authority within a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be in the Northern Territory an <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature with 19 or 20 members - it does not matter how many - it must assume responsibility for determining the priorities for expenditure and some responsibility for raising the revenue, or at least some of the revenue, to meet those priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not altogether go along with that, because if the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives prove to be unacceptable to the people of the Northern Territory undoubtedly they will be voted out of office at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee, prior to the double dissolution, was half way through taking evidence and completing an important report which was to contain recommendations to the Parliament on the setting up of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council in the Northern Territory and the powers which should be exercised by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make it clear to those honourable members who may not be so interested, let me say that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in his usual desire to honour his promises to the Aus tralian people, stated in his pre-election speech in 1972 that by the end of 1974 the Northern Territory would have a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members are, or should be, aware that the Northern Territory Legislative Council, as it is now constituted, has 11 members <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the community and 6 nominated members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Committee was asked to advise the Government as to the manner in which the proposed new legislative assembly should be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, what the proposed electoral divisions should be and what kind of electoral system should be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Minister, with the Committee’s report in hand, is to have a discussion with these persons who will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the redistribution, the machinery for which he has set in motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister is asking for a report to be on hand when he goes to discuss the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whatever he does to us he cannot, because of these problems, make us prepare a sensible report that will be of benefit to the Minister by the time he goes to discuss the matter with the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he said that the Bill to provide for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly of 19 members has in fact taken away the value of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say very clearly to him that every action that I have taken with respect to the time-table for the establishment of the new Legislative Assembly has been taken in full consultation and co-operation with the present <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They deliberated on this question and to a man and to a woman they said that in no circumstances would they agree to any significant extension of their term of office, and that they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the Northern Territory for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we had another election in the circumstances of the 1 1 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members it would make quite a farce of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The members deliberated and agreed that they wanted to achieve a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly by the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite clearly those people <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in local government are able to make their decisions close to the people affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the short time in which 1 have represented Fraser 1 have come to realise the full extent of the extremely heavy work-load with which the late Jim Fraser had to contend in looking after the whole of the Australian Capital Territory in the absence of other traditional forms of <span class="highlight">elected</span> representation by local government bodies and State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of course is the welcome announcement by the Government that it is intended to give the ACT a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly in the life of the present Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the quality of the form of self-government which is eventually decided upon or which may develop will depend to a very large extent upon the degree of public participation in community affairs and the extent to which decision making is delegated to locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To restrict an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body to such functions would not be acceptable to the citizens of Canberra as it would ignore the absence from the A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deny to an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body control over such elements would he in direct contradiction to the Government’s stated intention of achieving a high degree of public participation in community affairs in the A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end I suggest that any <span class="highlight">elected</span> self-governing body should have a voice on the National Capital Development Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such decision making should be delegated to an <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly or to a statutory authority which should he responsible to the assembly rather than to the Minister concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that those bodies ultimately should be made responsible to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly rather ‘ than to the responsible Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also tantamount to saying that a Minister of the Australian Government who has overall responsibilities for broad policy can he more responsive to the needs of local citizens than the representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> by and subject to recall by those citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the very fact that this attitude is abroad is a timely warning that people can become conditioned to domination by non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> bureaucrats and technocrats to the extent that they are willing to forgo their democratic right to self-government and to evade the acceptance of responsibility for their own government through <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To support this statement  I  would like to point out that in the States the number of electors for each <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislator, including local State and Australian government representatives ranges from one legislator to each 387 electors in Western Australia to one legislator to each 1,182 electors in New South Wales; whereas in the ACT, even allowing for the proposed new assembly we would have only one legislator for more than 5,000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I must say that the decision of last week to give the ACT an enlarged assembly of 18 <span class="highlight">elected</span> people with no legislative powers initially merely means that a powerless body of 8 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members is being replaced by an equally powerless body of 18 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has always eluded me completely why these ex-trade union secretaries having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to parliament seem to divorce themselves from any responsibility in industrial relations other than the one they previously had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have allowed the honourable member a reasonable degree of latitude in his opening remarks, but I remind him that the Bill deals with the establishment of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Terri tory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The discussions which ensued resulted in support for the principle enshrined in this legislation of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot see in this legislation any indication of the formation of electoral divisions in the Northern Territory or the nature of those divisions, and we must bear in mind that the election for the fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Northern Territory Legislative Assembly must be held before 24 October 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A ‘swifty’ report on the Committee’s references will not be conducive to the future development of the fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this legislation the Northern Territory is to get a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly but not self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the people of the Territory, particularly those who are to take part in the proposed election and who will perhaps sit on the first fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> constitutional body in the Territory, are anxiously waiting for clarification from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the people be faced with a situation in which there will be 19 <span class="highlight">elected</span> councillors with no defined tasks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (12.54)- I support the Northern Territory (Administration) Bill which proposes to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another argument in favour of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory is that this House will be able to get a report from the Assembly to consider at the same time as the report that is to be brought down by the Northern Territory Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another legislative councillor said that the Minister was far too busy to go to the Northern Territory to discuss matters with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> member who had the courtesy to write to him indicating that urgent discussions were needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one small paragraph of the second reading speech, the Minister does say that 5 members of the new Assembly will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Administrator’s Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the original scheme, 2 official members and 3 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council were members of the Administrator’s Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ward  made the very good suggestion that the 5 Assembly members <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Administrator’s Council should have responsibility for 5 of the departments responsible for administering various matters in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time remaining to me, I point out that if the Government does hold the election for the new assembly on 19 October - the term of the present Legislative Council expires on 24 October and the Minister is under the whip, as it were, of the Prime Minister to produce a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> body prior to the end of the year - the date proposed for the closing of nominations is 11 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You can take 19 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members, 2  teaspoonsful  of hope and a dash of finance and you can have instant government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that the Committee of which I was a member did when it was in Darwin was to hear evidence from members of the Legislative Council about the future role of an autonomous local government in the Territory, lt caused me some degree of disquiet to hear the attitude of some of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council, because I fear that if their views are able to prevail in a future self-governing Northern Territory we might have a situation of tyranny by the majority of the minority in 2 particular respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course a government in the Northern Territory would have to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr KELLY (Wakefield) (2.45&gt;- The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the election of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine the embarrassment that will occur at a political meeting if someone were to ask a candidate from the back of the hall what he is going to do when he is <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and what his task will be when he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> and the candidate were to say: T do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be better - this may be a counsel of perfection - if it is known before the election is held what will be the duties of the people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> at that election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unfortunately that is not so because the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson)  has made it clear that after the election in October he is going to approach the members of the newly-<span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly and they are going to sort out some of the problems as to the form of government they are going to administer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the members of the Northern Territory Assembly, when they are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, will also realise that self government is not just something about which to make speeches but something which creates infinite difficulty and pain before eventually it is made to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have done everything that we could to meet the wishes of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Council and we will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Government is determined to give self-government through a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Either he is extraordinaily ignorant of the files on record in his Department on this subject, or he is plainly trying to delude himself and probably those in the Caucus who <span class="highlight">elected</span> him to the Ministry that he is a man of great initiative and enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, as for the Minister at the table no one would be surprised that he wouldusethese initiatives in the Labor Party room toconvince those who sit behind him that hehas the makings of a statesman and is therefore worthy of being re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> to theMinistry.Butitis plain balderdash, and indeeddishonest,for him to come into this Parliament orthepublic arena outside to make such a claim.Heknows as well as I do that he would nothavebeenin a position to enter into negotiationwiththe <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> we have seen, as I said earlier, compassion expressed in the dairying industry in another way, that is, in the loss of 10,000 dairy farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He listed the proposal as one in which  a  coalition government, if <span class="highlight">elected</span> on May 18, would exercise moderation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On reading that document the Prime Minister would know that $20m was in addition - it specifically said so - to all commitments that were made by the previous Government - that is, the Whitlam Government that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he believes that setting up a conflict between the officially <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of unions, by appealing over their heads to the rank and file membership, will establish industrial peace in this country his attitude to these problems must be naive indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that the taxes and charges raised by <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments are to be spent in a way determined by Commonwealth Ministers or Commonwealth public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States had supposed that it was established to the satisfaction of all reasonable people that it was not reasonable that the Commonwealth should participate in the management of State instrumentalities or State bodies, the policies of which were the direct responsibility of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> State government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept which is seen here, as in so many other areas, is that the States are forced to tax regardless of their own policies, or the policies under which they may have been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Redrafting is required urgently for the Bills violate State constitutional authority force substantial increases in State motor taxation reduce effective expenditures on roads ensure chaotic delays in road programs threaten to penalise States for possible actions by local authorities and place power to veto <span class="highlight">elected</span> State government decisions in hands of Commonwealth public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here then is a Government twice <span class="highlight">elected</span>, <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a program twice endorsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is whether the parliamentary system is to be allowed to operate, whether the Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> to operate it for 3 years is to be allowed to implement the program the people <span class="highlight">elected</span> us to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto Australian governments have been able to plan for the term for which they were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could develop their programs in the confident belief that they would be judged by the people on their whole performance during the whole of their <span class="highlight">elected</span> term or at least as long as they retained a working majority in this House, the people’s House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House the Government has never lost any of the 23 divisions or looked like losing one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shortcomings of the Australian economy have been displayed in sharp relief as a result of the determination of this Government to spread the riches more equitably and to push this nation towards the ideals so clearly enunciated in the platform on which this Government has now twice been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who could blame local government people for believing that a great new world would open up before them if they <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Labor government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who could blame local government people and all those associated with local government for imagining that if they <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Mr Whitlam  to be Prime Minister of Australia new days would dawn in local government understanding? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government made efforts to enable the United Nations Security Council, of which Australia is presently an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member, to meet and discuss physical conflict and loss of life on and near  the  Paracel Islands involving China and South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, the Australian Labor Party did promise prior to the 1972 election that, if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government and if it were given the opportunity to put into effect its industrial relations policy by way of making certain amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it could and would introduce a better industrial relations climate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government in Victoria has for years and years had a road safety committee to investigate these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will prevent an <span class="highlight">elected</span> State government which wants to go to the people with a policy of taxing motorists to raise money for roads from laying down its program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Act of this Parliament should convey that power and privilege without first seeking the agreement either of the Australian people or of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the taxes and charges raised by <span class="highlight">elected</span> State governments and local government authorities are to be spent in a way determined by Commonwealth Ministers or those Ministers’ delegates who, of course, by definition will be public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having <span class="highlight">elected</span> it into government the new Cabinet or the returned Cabinet can, in accordance with its electoral mandate, formulate plans to build those roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this happens it will not be long before tha people in their electorates and municipalities start to realise that their <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials no longer have responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reject that sort of proposition not because I do not want to stop that expressway proposal but because I believe that the people who have the responsibility of making that decision are the New South Wales Government, the government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause is very much the centre of the whole problem with this legislation in that it gives the Federal Minister the right to delegate to any officer in his department the authority to override decisions taken by <span class="highlight">elected</span> State governments or <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Minister for Urban and Regional Develop- ment  (Mr Uren)  has any right to delegate an officer who will then have the right to override <span class="highlight">elected</span> State governments and <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case a delegated officer can overrule the wishes of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> State government or a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> local government body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that such an officer can override the wishes of a fully and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> State government or local government body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore again, if Government is to remain responsible not just to Parliament but to those governed, it is most important that people can easily and personally take issue with their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also convey my congratulations to the other new members on their contributions to this House through their maiden speeches- It is a significant honour to have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Hume to be their representative in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances the quality of representation would be greatly undermined as electors faced continual changes in both their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that we are afflicted in this country- I use the word ‘afflicted’ advisedly- by Upper Houses which are not democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>, which are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, which flout the very principle about which Benjamin Franklin talked in his words that I read to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most important part of our democratic structure that governments should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of one person one vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day after day he argued that it was undemocratic and unfair that a government should be frustrated by senators who in some cases had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> several years before Labor came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, quotas are determined on population and the first 75 members that were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place were <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of roughly 50,000 electors per member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as legislators, not just to become mere letter carriers to indicate that they have made some telephone call to a Minister and therefore that they are representing an area well- not at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of a double dissolution caused by senators who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis that they will look after State rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, as a result of the double dissolution we did remove a splinter Party which supported the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party through thick and thin but did not have enough votes to have one person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no obstructionism from the Senate if we are democrats and recognise that the voice of the people can be expressed in 2 chambers each <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a democratic basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, one looks at the quotas which senators have to achieve to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the States of New South Wales and Victoria at a periodic half Senate election, and then looks at what would be required to elect a senator from the Territories one will have not only a remarkable admiration for the dexterity with which the one vote one value principle can be espoused and then denied by members of the Labor Party, but also a picture of how unjust the representation would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970- the figures would be greater now, of course- a person required almost 300,000 votes to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a senator in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> a senator for the Australian Capital Territory all that would have been required in 1973 was 28,000 votes and to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> a senator from the Northern Territory all that would have been required was 10,600 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can understand the system, senators, who are not State government people and who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate as representatives of the New South Wales Government, the Queensland Government, the Victorian Government, the Tasmanian Government or the Western Australian Government, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate according to a different system of elections than those relating to the House of Representatives, but just as members of the House of Representatives are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that House to represent the people of a particular part of Australia, so too do senators represent people and not State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little while ago in the House of Representatives we heard the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  say in respect of one of the measures that the Joint Sitting will discuss tonight or tomorrow- I refer to the National Health legislation which proposes a health scheme on which this Government campaigned and was <span class="highlight">elected</span>; it was proposed first to the Australian people in 1968 and was restated in 1969, 1972 and 1974-that he and the Opposition would go to the barricades rather than yield one iota, one inch, to the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an artificial argument to consider that members of the Senate are voted for and are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the electorate of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rather thought he would be most apprehensive after the allegation which he has made about people who have been validly <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a corporation which was established by vote in this chamber and, in the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now he queries the basis on which those people were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, we believe that as the Northern Territory moves towards statehood it should be given an opportunity to have the same sort of Senate voice as every other State, not a watered down Senate voice with senators who are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for less than a full term and senators who are to be restricted in such a way as to reduce the power of those who are normal members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not surprising that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council have for a number of years pressured Federal governments to give Senate representation to the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that all senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as House of Representatives elections are held, we have written this present provision into the Bill which we hope after today will become the law of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somehow it is suggested that because people live in these territories they are unworthy of being represented in the Senate and that <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives from the territories should not sit in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on different terms and at different times but with powers equal to any other bona fide senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was largely due to the pressures applied by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council that the former Liberal Party-Country Party Government made a firm offer to the Northern Territory towards constitutional advancement and executive power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On present growth forecasts if they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the time of the next electionin about 3 years time- they would each represent more than the number of people represented by each senator from Tasmania, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take a broader view and look at all the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people in the States, the position is even more remarkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we in the Australian Capital Territory had our new assembly of 18 <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative assembly members, 2 members of the House of Representatives and 2 senators, we would have one <span class="highlight">elected</span> person to more than 5,000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the smallest States, we see that Western Australia has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> member for each 387 electors, South Australia has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> member for every 527 electors and Tasmania has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative for each 480 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not go before the people in an election campaign and advocate a policy in opposition of Labor, and then because the Government got a miserable majority of 5 in one House and a minority of 2 in another, come here and desert the causes that people <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people on adult suffrage with potency equal to that of the gentlemen and ladies who inhabit the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are to go out every time the Prime Minister goes to the hustings, in the hope that he can get a Labor senator <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They <span class="highlight">elected</span> 6 senators and 5 members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the realities of the Senate: Because it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> equally from the States, it is almost bound to be equally divided after an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me say something about it and for it as a non-voter in the Australian Capital Territory but as one who has been deeply involved in it ever since I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place 19 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well take the honourable member for Moreton at his word and have 5, 15 or 50 senators from each Territory, but so long as they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the system advocated and proposed in the Bill it will not make a jot of difference to the balance in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable Minister appears far too busy of late to come to the Territory to discuss matters with <span class="highlight">elected</span> members even when they paid the courtesy of writing to him or indicating that urgent discussions are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are members of the Opposition parties being so complimentary to us as to say that the Australian Labor Party will receive over twothirds of the votes in each of those Territories and thus have its senators <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What conceivable difference can it make from a party point of view if there are 2 senators from each Territory <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of proportional representation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not reason suggest that there will be one member in support of the Government and one member in support of the Opposition <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each of these Territories? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that in the House of government the Australian Labor Party has a majority to which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and in the Senate a combination of misfit organisations holds a majority owing to the flukes of preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always been a little mystified as to why the fact that someone was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1 899 makes him more sagacious than somebody who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that each of those 2 senators should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the proportional representation system on each occasion that the elections take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are to be senators from the States <span class="highlight">elected</span>- the public has voted for this at Senate elections- separately, if necessary, as States and groups of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are to be Territorial representatives <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a formula of by-elections, quite differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we have been regarded as obstructing the wish of the Australian Government to introduce its health scheme, I believe that I represent the people of Victoria who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> me to this place, and I assure them that it will not be my vote that will enable a nationalised health scheme to be introduced into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact a most radical step was suggested- that members of the boards of these funds should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the Senate is a States House because there are 10 senators from each State <span class="highlight">elected</span> to it so that an equal representation from each State is maintamed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, in government the Liberal and Country Parties did not believe in governing and out of government they do not believe in allowing the <span class="highlight">elected</span> popular government to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under our out-of-date for the 1970s form of government, with the States warring with the Australian Government, a hostile Senate with extraordinary powers able to frustrate the will of the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Representatives, members of the Opposition have plenty of opportunities to practice this obstructionism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A week ago at the memorial service in St Andrew’s Church’ in Canberra I quoted the words he used tb describe his approach to foreign policy soon after his Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> VicePresident of the Labor Party in 1963 and went on to become the youngest <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader of the party in its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His advice to me when I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament in 1969 was quite invaluable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament in 1945 he was a very kind and valued adviser to me, as a new member, about how to settle into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘ Government appears to be quite helpless in the face of this problem, and of course this is not surprising in a world in which the power of the trade unions exceeds the power of <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments, particularly this Government that we have at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly I have the opportunity to follow immediately and then to get on with the business of the Parliament- of the Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> to rule the country- in the terms of the notice paper and the blue program sheet which has been circulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the day we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Government has acted consistently to improve real living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the idea of the Leader of the Opposition on leadership, all I can say is that it would be a damned sight easier for this Government to give leadership in our area of responsibility, governing Australia according to the program on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span>, if he were able to give some leadership in his area of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he could control his wild men in the Senate, if there were one Liberal Party in this Parliament instead of two, this Government would be much better able to get on with the job for which it has been twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> and much better able to carry out its program which has been twice endorsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can only act on the basis of the advice of the leadership group <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Papua New Guinea in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if we are talking about indignation I would like the honourable member for Mackellar to consider you,  Mr Speaker,  on more occasions than in the past and also to consider members on this side of the House and other members of the Parliament who feel that they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to say something in this Parliament at odd times and particularly during the adjournment debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently almost 1 million people had no say in what government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, irrespective of their political opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to draw attention further to the tragic circumstances in Western Australia where legislation which has been sent from the Lower House to the Upper House proposes to take from Australian citizens their basic freedoms at law and to give to an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government powers which were not mentioned during that government’s election manifesto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite are suggesting that they enjoy some sort of purity in relation to increasing charges, I remind them again that I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament after the then Opposition in the Senate, improperly in my view- I say that quite advisedly- had blocked increased postal charges, in May 1967, on exactly the same pretext as was used on this occasion, that is, that they should be included as a general budgetary item. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will leave that aside but will get to the fact that in my State, anyway, <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Party senators and others in the State field are refusing to attend growers’ meetings when they wish to register their protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that when the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Party to government they realised how fierce those costs were going to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is to say, the growers of the commodity, who in the final analysis are the owners of the commodity, elect to that Board people whom they deem fit to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> as then representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are totally opposed to the proposition that a Minister sitting in another place can dismiss summarily people <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the industry and have them replaced with some second-hand petty trade union official. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be added that the Labor Party platform, in providing for adequate representation for primary producers on ail boards effecting the handling and marketing of their products, does not preclude a majority of <span class="highlight">elected</span> growers’ representatives on such boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, that Government could not be outdone by the greatest obstructionist in the Australian States,  Sir Robert  Askin, who went to the polls and was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a mandate to obstruct any action by the Federal Government, regardless of whether it was beneficial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want the Minister to tell us that the Government will not remove decent members of the Australian Wheat Board from the positions to which they have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by rank and file wheat growers and replace them with Al Grassby, Jack Egerton, Bob Hawke and even Jack Mundey or Halfpenny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also recall at the end of 1949 a Liberal-Country Party government being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Australia on the promise that it would put value back in the pound yet in 1 950 Australia experienced the highest rate of price increase ever in its history- an increase of 23 per cent or about half as much again as the worst that has occurred under the guidance of the Whitlam Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the Deputy Prime Minister is not only a member of the Congress for International Cooperation and Disarmament but also, as I understand it, is its <span class="highlight">elected</span> president, and given also the fact that that organisation is currently distributing brochures and pamphlets calling on this Government to adopt a non-aligned foreign policy for Australia, will the Prime Minister state unequivocally that non-alignment is not to be the foreign policy aim of his Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a very strong Prime Minister, it could mean centralisation in the hands of one person, and where the Cabinet was generally lacklustre it would mean that power could reside in a few non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members should remember that it is all right for such changes to be made in the Caucus Room and flung into this House, but if the Senate- the Senate the other House <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people- makes one suggestion or one amendment it is obstructionist and unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a grand design for income redistribution combined with social welfare policies to help the low income earners within our community, but it has ignored the fact that inflation is reducing the real purchasing power of income, that there is a rapidly falling value of money, that prices for goods and services are rising and that there is a lower net income as taxes increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Australia <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Australian Labor Party to office in 1972 because of its promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if one takes the Prime Minister’s argument that the proposal affects only those with incomes of more than $ 1 0,000 a year, surely governments are <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the purpose of governing for the entire country and not for sections of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What would be the position in many of the cases involving writs taken out in the past where it was proved that the person charged or the person who had brought on the charge was not a properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> person, that the organisation named in the charge or dispute was not actually the one so named because of some deficiency in forming, reforming or uniting? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that if the Queensland State AWU is in fact a living State organisation now with its properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> officers and with its membership in accordance with its registered constitution and eligibility rule, then it follows that Bowman Building and Dunstan House and all of the property in Queensland held in the name of the AWU in that State is the property of the State union, not the property of the federal union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the case to which he referred first arose in the middle 1950s, not in 1968, when there was an inner faction argument in the New South Wales Branch of the Transport Workers Union as to which candidates had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, whether they had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in the branch of the Federal organisation or in the State registered union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter which concerns me seriously is the campaign, which has been going on for as long as I can remember but which has moved strongly in recent months, to suggest that only certain persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament have any right to any say in decisions of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is in many ways desirable that we should have Australians <span class="highlight">elected</span> to positions of influence in that organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the undertaking which I gave to members of the Legislative Council as it then was some months ago: As soon as the new Assembly is <span class="highlight">elected</span> I will certainly sit down with its members and we will progressively go step by step through the problems which obviously will not be easy in the first few years of government in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that everyone in this country should accept that the Australian Labor Party was 2 years ago and again a few months ago <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power in Australia on a clear policy of not only developing Australia’s great resources of minerals and energy in a rational way but also to see that those resources were in the hands of Australians and that decisions were not being taken elsewhere in the world as so often they were in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Government’s wish to establish a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory by 3 1 December 1 974; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I am sure that our Government would not have tried to steamroll over the responsibilities of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people of the Northern Territory in the manner in which this Government has attempted to do so in the last 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are faced with the problem of how much power they, as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian people, should give to such bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been conceived in sin because it has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a completely false pretence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should not the Queensland Government, <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Queensland, be heard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Government tries to dominate the Queensland Government and tries to take away from a constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> State government its constitutional rights then, of course, the Federal Government cannot expect to get co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable members that the 3 Bills that we are considering tonight provide an example of how well projects in Queensland can proceed, of just how effectively the important work necessary for the development of Queensland can be carried out, when the State Government is prepared to do what it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Queensland to do and to cooperate with the Government of this nation which has the responsibility of raising the necessary finances and providing those finances to the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite him to cast aside his narrow political attitudes of the past and, even at this late hour, use the example set by these 3 measures to accept the genuine opportunities that are offered to him so frequently by this Australian Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the same people that he believes put him into power, even though under the electoral gerrymander system existing in Queensland they had little opportunity to do otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again express the hope that the Queensland Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 7 December will be a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever government is <span class="highlight">elected</span>, I hope that we get the same degree of co-operation between that Government and the Federal Government that this Federal Government has received from every other State in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When that Parliament was dissolved and the new Parliament <span class="highlight">elected</span> the question was resubmitted, and it was remained unanswered, so it has actually been on the notice paper for more than 12 months both in the term of this Parliament and in the term of the previous Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The public meeting <span class="highlight">elected</span> an interim committee of which I am a member and I, as well as many other people, believed that we were set to get the health centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There have been many cases in which the British Parliament has passed a law extending its own term of office, the most recent being the parliament which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1935 for 5 years and which was extended until 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Rarely in a multiple party system does the final vote on first past the post voting bring with it a majority of votes for the party which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many times, particularly in recent years, has a British government been <span class="highlight">elected</span> with more than 40 per cent of the primary vote? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With first past the post voting and multiple parties the chance of having a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the majority of votes is reduced dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this system we add the numbers given to the votes for each candidate and the person with the lowest number is <span class="highlight">elected</span> because he has the highest number of first or second preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under such a system all one has to do to get <span class="highlight">elected</span> is to pack up the ballot paper with bodgies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that he will then recant and drop that suggestion because he might convince someone that the Parliament should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the community view is expressed by the members <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the House of Representatives election in 1969, when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament, the Liberal Party polled 42. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation with regard to the Senate under the proposed system would be that in all but a very small number of cases the number of votes required to be cast would cover the candidates <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the provisions designed to help the elector, or is their purpose to aid only the <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change designed to assist the administrators of the system and those who are or would seek to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under it should be made only if the change is in the interests of the electors as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until 1918 that the system was changed in this country, so every government in Australia up to 1918 was undemocratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> if a first past the post voting system is undemocratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the promises on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> was a plan worked over by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government, but this Government has stolen it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office we had in Australia an inflation rate of  4Vi  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were doing what the Leader of the Country Party alleges we would be doing we would be failing in the trust to every one of those people who have supported the Australian Labor Party over decades and who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> this Government to govern on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no case has the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country Party, who followed him in the debate, in criticising destructively what the Government has done in the last 2 years said what he would have done in the circumstances if he had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government in December 1972, had the Australian people made a serious mistake and returned him once more to government- an inconceivable situation, of course, at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>History has been made in the establishment of a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>History has been made also- while we were in the Northern Territory we saw the candidates for the election- in that a full blood Aborigine has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a greater tribute than any I can pay to recall that after his first term U Thant was reappointed for a further 5 years as SecretaryGeneral, and would have received the confidence of the United Nations for a third term had he not <span class="highlight">elected</span> to retire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-After listening to the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  I can state that unless one was very familiar with the situation in Queensland one could almost believe that the Government of Queensland was democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is the first time I have heard an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government being spoken of as a government imposed upon the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> the dairying industry has been clearly in the sights of the Government with respect to repressive and discriminatory policy actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what basis and with what right has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> Minister a claim to change the basis of election of others who in another area, in this instance the Wool Corporation, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by those who own the clip and who produce the clip to represent them within that Corporation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing that has happened since we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government has caused me to change my view about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the Services civilian control means control by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government in <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the present State governments, particularly those in the 4 non-Labor States, are guilty of a conspiracy against the Australian Government in an attempt to strangle any efforts it is making to carry out the policies upon which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sitting up in the back of the chamber is an honourable member who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 26 per cent of the primary vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said we are in a fortunate position because the price of our oil is much lower than in any other part of the wo but he conveniently overlooked the fact thai if the Liberal and Country Parties had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the last elections the Leader of the Country Party would have screwed the Leader of the Liberal Party- to use that coarse Americanism which the honourable gentleman seemed to gain such delight from repeating a moment ago; and I could not think of anything worse than witnessing that kind of performance- until he agreed to an increase of $4 a barrel for crude oil produced in the Bass Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the Opposition’s policy when it was in government was deliberately designed to induce unemployment and had nothing whatever to do with an economic downturn in the economies of our trading partners, the present Government’s monetary and fiscal policies are deliberately aimed at reducing unemployment, even against the influences of the cyclical economic downturn throughout the western world caused mainly by the increase in the price of crude oil, an increase which the Country Party proposes to inflict upon this country if ever it is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that daily the device of raising a matter of public importance is used by the Opposition to delay the business of the House and to frustrate the will of this freely and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> within a matter of days the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said: ‘One of our first actions will be to move the Papua-Queensland border’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to pay serious attention to what it may regard as something about which it was worth while producing flowery rhetoric when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not surprising since the people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> decide who will vote for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have to inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon  Mr B.  F.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absolutely unthinkable that two or three Bills relating to the Northern Territory which have been introduced into this House since the election of the Assembly- an assembly which was promised by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to be a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> assembly before 3 1 December this year- have not been referred to the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that role should not be dependent upon the political affiliations of the people appointed to the Corporation but upon their capabilities as individuals and as representatives of the industry, whether it be in the role of a specialist or of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should he not accept another body which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the wool growers of this country to represent them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Conference also dealt with other procedural and organisational matters affecting the management of the Association and I am happy to report that our nominee,  Mr R.  H.

    <p>Once they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> that is it; the Prime Minister is stuck with them, as all honourable members know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senators <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Vh  years and  6lA  years before the Government in the House of Representatives, senators who had already blocked essential parts of our legislative program, forced us to the polls halfway through our term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> the full Senate- not half of the Senate but the full Senate- in May last year they made a decision that a brake had to be put on the excesses of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have a look at what has happened since December 1972 when the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The members of the Legislative Assembly were <span class="highlight">elected</span> last year and they are very keen people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the intervening period between 1970 and when this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972, the honourable member for Barker and the Government of that period suddenly became exceedingly and, indeed, excessively amenable to the point of view of the private health insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One ofthe specific platforms of policy on which this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power- and reelected is that we would expand the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation to enable it to do its job more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On my return to Europe I visited Greece, where I had talks on 3 January with the recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> Prime Minister,  Mr Karamanlis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They may not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by members of the people or to any parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Union officials would not willingly allow themselves to be caught in a position which revealed a lack of rapport with the members they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are looking at this as a comparatively new thing because until the Senate was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by proportional representation this matter was not of any great significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This type of legislation is common to any democracy and I believe it should be retained so that the town planning program can be developed by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the wilful misuse of paragraph (b) could mean that the democratic <span class="highlight">elected</span> rights of the people of the Northern Territory, in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, could see themselves without any responsibility to make laws for the order and good government of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the Minister who denied assistance to one of the young newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly who went to Adelaide to try to help the establishment of the rescue operations and to try to follow the refugees down the track, helping where he could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation has been drawn up, I understand, without any consultation or co-operation between the Federal Government and the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the new Legislative Assembly have not been consulted about the legislation which will govern their lives for 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be a greater effort to have consultation not only with the citizens in general, but also particularly with the members of the newly-<span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we will not propose amendments is in absolute accord with our attitude to this matter which is that the people who are involved, the people who have been stricken, should have the opportunity, through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, of putting their point of view in relation to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Open government was a pious expression which went out the window the day after this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and there are thousands of examples to prove it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who sent these telegrams want to know just how much say their <span class="highlight">elected</span> bodies will have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I pointed out earlier, one member of the Commission will be nominated by the Legislative Assembly and another by the Corporation of the City of Darwinboth <span class="highlight">elected</span> bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not so long ago that a majority of the members of the Australian Labor Party had to convince important sections of the Austraiian community, including tens of thousands who took part in Vietnam moratorium demonstrations, including hundreds of thousands who supported what were called ‘political strikes’, that despite 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule they had not been disfranchised; that it was still possible for Labor Party governments to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>; that when Labor Party governments were <span class="highlight">elected</span> they would be given the same opportunities as the Liberal Party governments which preceded them; that they would have the same opportunities to put their policies into effect; that they would have the same protection from the conventions as the governments that preceded them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this matter we are concerned not only about convention; I think we as parliamentarians, and any person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a parliament, must also realise that in parliaments there must be a large element of magnanimity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes the broad view of Australia’s political situation at present it must be stated that the failure of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  to give any leadership to the Opposition parties, the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to state whether or not he intends torpedoeing the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of this country by denying supply are major destabilising factors in Austraiian politics at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This requirement is not something which does not exist anywhere else; it is a provision in almost every democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament with which we would like to compare ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 that number had crept to 69 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until we change this system members of this Parliament can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament and break that law by receiving funds donated from God knows where. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can give all people the opportunity to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, knowing full well that their expenditures, incomes and other related matters will be known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The management of a stock exchange in Australia is in the hands of a committee <span class="highlight">elected</span> from its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of people reading the proposal upon which they were asked to vote would look at it and say: ‘ Well, there is very considerable merit in this, having both of the Houses of Parliament <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time’, little realising, of course, that the proposal to be put into the Constitution related to almost a hideously confused set of provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only alteration proposed to be made by this Bill as regards casual vacancies is to bring the terms of the section of the Constitution relating to persons appointed to fill casual vacancies into line with the terms of office of senators who would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the other provisions of the Constitution proposed to be altered by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that even in such a light-hearted and obviously less than convincing opposition to the Bill the honourable gentleman would not have expected the Government to exclude from the Bill provisions under which senators filling casual vacancies would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to serve the same periods set down for those persons whom they were replacing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a reasonable proposition that the 2 Houses of the Parliament of Australia should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time when the issues before the people are over who should govern the country and of questioning the administration, whoever it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is all right if the Senate accepts its role as a House of review and if the Senate accepts that governments <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the time when government is on the line are entitled to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have now clearly established that they do not believe that the tenure of office of governments <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern has any relevance whatsoever where it interferes with the personal ambitions of men whose greed for power would destroy the whole parliamentary system if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Parliament, controlled by members of the Liberal Party, has since 196 1 consistently passed special legislation in order to circumvent the Constitution of that State, which requires that the Upper House should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a different time to the lower House, in order that conjoint elections can take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Houses of the Victorian Parliament are now always <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same day by resolution of Houses of Parliament in which the Liberal Party has an absolute majority, but in this Parliament for some short term temporary political gain the Opposition wishes to preserve ad infinitum a situation in which one House at a time can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and elections are held for part of the Federal Parliament in 2 years out of every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to members of the Opposition that they would be far better spending their time in trying to maintain the Senate as an <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of the Parliament whose members represent the wishes of the people of the various States who elect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate were <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the one day, and certainly I do not think that the Prime Minister of this country got any advantage out of that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said, because of the proportional representation method that is used to elect senators in this country- and my colleague the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  has already pointed out that there are only ever 6 senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a half senate election situation, the other 24 being in effect appointed by their various political parties- the Senate for ever more will be evenly balanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a House which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by universal franchise; it is a House which has a built in equality of State representation; and it is a House which, by reason of developments in recent years, is adopting for itself a role quite separate and distinct from the role of upper houses of the various States that make up the Australian Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think on balance that it does considerable violence to the role of the Australian Senate, as it has now evolved, to remove from the Constitution the built in proviso that except in the case of a double dissolution, a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Senate shall serve a period of not less than 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By what rule of common sense do we approve of a situation in which these elections are held at different times and people elect a House of Representatives- the House that they think is the Government- and then have that Government’s will thwarted and frustrated by the members of a chamber which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> at different times from members of the House of Representatives and half of whose members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> at a different time from the other half of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the relationship between the House of Representatives and the Senate which they applaud and which leads to the situation that exists in this country today, the properly democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government cannot at any time govern for more than 6 months with any assurance of continuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legal process is to retain the confidence of the nation, the extent to which the High Court exercises its undoubted power not to adhere to a previous decision to its own must be consonant with the consensus of opinion of the public, of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislature and of the judiciary as to the proper balance between the respective roles of the legislature and of the judiciary as law makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be influenced by the federal or unitary nature of the constitution and whether it is written or unwritten, by the legislative procedure in Parliament, by the ease with which parliamentary time can be found to effect amendments in the law which concern only a small minority of citizens, by the extent to which Parliament has been in the habit of intervening to reverse judicial decisions by legislation; but most of all by the underlying political philosophy of the particular nation as to the appropriate limits of the lawmaking function of a non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important aspect about this provision is that, by the Constitution of Australia, the will of the people, if we wish to put it in those terms, is expressed in this vacuum of a casual vacancy by the Houses of the Parliament of the State constituted by the individuals <span class="highlight">elected</span> to those Houses by the constitutional processes of that State, and those Houses of the Parliament then have entrusted to them in aU the acts that they perform the expression of the Will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1972, before my Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, two of the State governments asked the British Government to recommend to the Queen of Britain that this question be referred to the British Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that basis, the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Labor Government in the last two of those 3 elections and the Bill dealing with Medibank was enacted following its passage at the Joint Sitting of the 2 Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on this measure and re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> on this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been no statement made or no indication given to the rural community that one of those significant parts of the Labor Government’s policy on which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> will ever be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these terms, the Opposition strongly advocates that the board chairmen should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from and by board members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the legislation, board autonomy and the free flow of information among members would be greatly enhanced by ensuring that the chairmen are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the boards, the artists must be represented- they must not’ have their decisions given to them cut and dried by people selected from above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Elected</span>, they will have to be responsive to the desires and decisions of their constituents and they should have no more right of access to information, no more right to initiate or promulgate policy, than any other board member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Elected</span>, they would have to be more responsive to the desires and decisions of their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council would consist then of the 7 <span class="highlight">elected</span> Board chairmen and the  Chairman  of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want an organisation that has a strong co-ordinating role, an organisation that is free to develop an overall arts policy, an organisation that represents the interests of artists via the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> chairmen and, at the same time, an organisation that has the administrative ability to handle properly its dealings with the boards and negotiate with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it would be a very great mistake to adopt the suggestion that everyone on the boards and the chairmen of those boards ought to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by actors, dancers, producers or directors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There also is a close relationship between this question and the degree of independence which these committees must be given under their democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> chairmen because, as with any large organisation of this nature, we are running a real risk of the octopus syndrome- the heart hes in the middle, the tentacles go out in all directions to the various areas of the arts, but ultimately they are all directed back towards the centre and the administrative section of the centre grows and grows in accordance with the best Parkinsonian principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that once it was thought that the way to give people encouragement and flexibility in the field was to set up a statutory corporation, so we have the Australian Broadcasting Commission and many different sorts of statutory corporations; but in these days when there is a need for re-emphasis upon the role of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people at the various levels of government, there is a need for that area of government to be underlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to stress the significance of the role of the people as expressed through <span class="highlight">elected</span> bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It occurs to me that the Minister who interjected, as well as those sitting at the table- the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development- have no interest in the people of the Northern Territory simply because those people <span class="highlight">elected</span> a government of a different colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite seek to give powers to a corporation that is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister of the day is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people and is answerable to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition gives extended powers to the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which is not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body, it is being anti-democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable members opposite say that those non-<span class="highlight">elected</span> bodies should not have some ministerial direction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking the Parliament to do is to give authority to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intercede very briefly to say first of all that this particular clause, in respect of which we have just had advocacy from that great champion of democracy, is the one that gives complete autocratic authority to a man who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Parliament of the Commonwealth- not by the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a quite different consideration to look at the politics of a body created in order to assist the people of a Territory which is growing towards statehood and which has an <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly, as my colleague the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly has not been granted more authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he were to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, we would have the advantage of the inside knowledge of one of the great insider traders of our time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a policy propounded by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Labor Party that all pensions would be adjusted over a period of one Parliament, which is 3 years, until they reached 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Now that the Opposition has had its horse laugh the rest is this: If we had a little co-operation from the Opposition in terms of the application of our policy on which we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a government, I might be able to spare staff for such a purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task then is to make the Commission responsible to the public interest through the <span class="highlight">elected</span> body, which is the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the power to say whether the trading on a security should stop or should not stop is given to a group of often anonymous people who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the public in the same way as we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">elected</span> and they have public opinion behind them all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least he is an <span class="highlight">elected</span> officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was that not long ago, apart from the mining scandals in this country, when selected applications through the Commission would have been appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will transfer the exercising of that power to properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead they, who are presently in Government, are prepared to see the destruction of Parliament and of the system whence government itself is <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This evening I have great pleasure in seconding the motion that he be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the position of  Speaker  of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From today’s performance it is clear that a  Speaker  under the present Prime Minister will need to have very great courage to stand for the principles which he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to uphold in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, you have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to an extremely important position- the most important position of this Parliament- under very unfortunate circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is for all these reasons that I suggest to the House that  Mr Lucock  be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the position of  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I believe that tonight a great responsibility has been thrust upon you, and an equally great responsibility is to be carried by the person who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> as your  deputy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it incredible that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the two largest organisations in Australia should be denied any chance to put his views to the public simply because the owner of a station licence is opposed to those views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Speaker, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to your high office and to wish you well in your new post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For its part, the Government will continue to try to make the system work, to make this Parliament work, to legislate through this Parliament according to the forms of this Parliament and the traditions of this Parliament, to carry out the program, for which it has been already twice <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have completely and utterly rejected the authority of the  Speaker,  <span class="highlight">elected</span> first following the elections in 1972, without opposition, to take charge of the proceedings of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether or not I am preselected by the Liberal Party is not for him to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of whether, having been pre-selected, if that should occur, I shall be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the electors of Mackellar is again not for the Prime Minister to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, I should say that by his conduct he makes it extremely unlikely that a Labor member would ever be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the seat of Mackellar, and I do not think that he has any say in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would love to administer it so that they could use money made available by this Parliament and let it go direct to local government authorities, ignoring the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the Federal Parliament completely and letting members of State Parliaments who have had nothing to do with the raising of the revenue be the only ones to be recognised by the local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Advisory Council, which until September of last year was a small body consisting of persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the community and nominees of departments, was replaced by a chamber of 18 members all <span class="highlight">elected</span> on an adult franchise in September 1 974, and the new institution designated the Legislative Assembly, although it had no legislative functions, has been meeting and conducting business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our recommendation that there should be a unicameral assembly to be called the Legislative Assembly consisting of 19 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members who should be regarded as employed fulltime on their parliamentary duties and paid accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite unfair and ridiculous to suggest that people should make a sacrifice that would affect their families or their future simply because of the old concept that people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament need not be paid anything at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would appear that the Government is not recognising the voice of the Advisory Council, a body which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Aboriginal people in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These clauses take away from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal councils their right to determine who shall visit their reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not matter a damn whether the Minister thinks the <span class="highlight">elected</span> councils are appropriate bodies or not to make the determination as to who shall visit their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this proposal it has ignored the lack of support it has had from the Aboriginal people, the pleas by the only <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal member of this Parliament,  Senator Bonner,  and the plea by the Opposition to ascertain by a poll among the Aboriginal people the wishes of the Aboriginal people before this arbitrary action is taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the pleas by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal councils the Government continued to proceed with these provisions- provisions taking away their authority as to who shall enter their reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before it was amended the Bill removed the authority from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal advisory councils to determine who shall enter their reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to make the point that the legislation that we put forward now is not merely an initiative of the Labor Government which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 2 December 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are embodied in these amendments -  deleted from this Bill to allow the responsibility of the communities to lie in the hands of the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely there are people on the Government benches who can see the wisdom, in accordance with their own policy and philosophy, in leaving the power to decide who shall enter the reserves in Queensland to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aboriginal councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 I sought an electoral office in the most populous part of my electorate, at Campbelltown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Liberal Party have <span class="highlight">elected</span> a person who they say will lead them to victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That principle hardly applies to the honourable member who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> Leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the words from the person who, since  Mr Snedden  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> Leader of the Liberal Party in 1973, has not let up for one instant in trying to take over the role of Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But without wishing to drag down the tone of this debate, the fact is that that is the right of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The one great characteristic of the Australian voting system, which has been denigrated, rubbished and criticised, is that it is the only voting system in the world which is designed to guarantee that nobody is <span class="highlight">elected</span> unless he gets 50 per cent plus one of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposed amendment has in it the ingredients to destroy the proposition that nobody can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in Australia unless they receive 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One could instance such examples time and time again in relation to Senate elections when ballot papers are marked and the clear intention of electors so far as the number of people to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> is concerned has been expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposals which the present Opposition made in March 1971 and which this Government made last November included provisions for improving voting facilities for patients and inmates of hospitals, convalescent homes and institutions, franchise rights for representatives of a government or public authority who are posted overseas, and the prohibition of members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Australian Parliament while still members of that Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has indicated that at the last Senate election the quota was not known until more than 2 weeks after polling day and therefore senators could not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> until 3 weeks after polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He never defines the term ‘special circumstances’, but obviously the special circumstances will be the circumstances which create a state of temporary unpopularity which will make it profitable for the Opposition once again to misuse its power in the Senate to refuse the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government the money needed to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-This legislation has about it the elements of one of the most historic pieces of legislation that the Government has introduced since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972- not historic, I believe, in the sense that it will go down on the statute books of this Parliament as having made a massive contribution to the resolution of interstate difficulties and difficulties between the States and the Commonwealth Government, but historic in the sense that never before in the period that the Government has been in office has an attempt been made to establish a body with such tremendous power under the cloak of such benign justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to members of the Opposition that they should have second thoughts about their attitude and that they should devote every effort possible to understanding what the legislation is about and to show some progressiveness as they are suggesting to the nation they intend to do under their recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> leader, and support this progressive legislation that has been introduced by the Minister for Transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not see why the interests of those people should be overruled in the interests of one person who is seeking to be insulated from the market forces by an utterly iniquitous agreement in the 2-airline agreement that was consented to by the previous Parliament and cannot be rescinded by even the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If more and more trade union members were aware of what their unions are doing and what their <span class="highlight">elected</span> officials are doing, I think the performance of the unions as a whole would improve substantially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In these days of increased collective bargaining and conciliation it is essential that the trade union official be an extremely competent person and be able to put forward the views of his union members fully so that he can do the job for which they have <span class="highlight">elected</span> him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think one of the objectives of this Bill is to increase rank and file participation; to give the man at the grass roots level the chance to further his trade union education and to give him education in a much broader field so that he is a lot more competent to carry out the job for which his members have <span class="highlight">elected</span> him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the honourable member for Griffith, if he is not prepared to accept it already, that some more enlightened members of the Liberal Party in Queensland, including one recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the State Parliament, warned the executive of the Liberal Party recently that a swing against the State Government in the next election could see the Liberal Party being the only party to lose seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been associated with the National Country Party over very many years; and, as vice-president of the Party in Queensland and, well before I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that office, as, I believe, an influential member of the organisation and as a member of this Parliament, I have never condoned an approach by our Party to contest a Liberal-held seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I remember when I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House that the present Minister railed against the Country Party night after night and attacked the Country Party only because he could never beat it at the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> under those laws in the 1972 election and again in the 1974 election so the laws cannot be so very biased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true to say that for many years after the war, successive Liberal-Country Party governments were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people on policies to increase our population, to broaden our economic base and to develop one of the highest living standards in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1958 and in the early 1960s I commenced to agitate against, firstly, the Menzies Government, then the Holt Government, then the Gorton Government and then the McMahon Government, to try to get some money to restore the oldest dwelling in Australia, Elizabeth Farm cottage, built in 1793. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>years later, we stand here in Parliament and we have to survey the economic disaster that has befallen this nation because we have a Government which has shown itself quite conclusively to be incapable of making difficult and rational decisions at times when any government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people to control and manage the economy would expect such decisions to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason for the motion of course is that the Labor Party knows that if it were to go to the Australian electorate in circumstances in which it were forced to contest the elections on present boundaries, very few members of the Australian electorate who <span class="highlight">elected</span> it in May 1974 or December 1972 would again give it a licence to abuse the whole of our administrative system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put to the House and to the people of Australia that a system which has resulted in both sides of our political spectrum being <span class="highlight">elected</span> cannot be so very unfair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously they have not only forgotten that the Senate was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on that date but also they have forgotten that an identical referendum to that which we are now discussing in connection with this Bill was also submitted to the Australian electorate on 18 May 1974 and was resoundingly defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the 1972 election the Prime Minister indicated that the Labor Party, if returned to office, would take up the offer to take over the 2 State systems, but when the Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office and the offer to take over the systems was made to the States we found that we did not get any response from the Liberal States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great value of that system of full preference voting- I am not going to get into a discussion of voting systems and counting systems in any great detail- is that every person who casts a vote has a say in who the <span class="highlight">elected</span> candidate is, once the 2 major contenders, the 2 most favoured candidates, are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it is a very important principle in our parliamentary representative democracy that individuals have the right to stand and have the chance of being <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should one candidate be so prejudiced in his efforts to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber by the fact that he is unable to attract to his support those who can write cheques for vast sums of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the Treasurer is a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament and is not a member of the Public Service of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that this nation would like to see its representative being truly its representative and, in that role, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> head of the defence Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton and the other honourable gentlemen who sit opposite do not believe that the commander of an Australian force should be there by a convention but believe that his position should be there by a statute of this Parliament in which his powers are laid out by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian people so that in the event of a crisis he may thoroughly command the Australian forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was glad to hear the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Cadman)  point out that under a democratic system any person who occupies the position of Minister for Defence has an authority from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is nothing unusual in the legislation which lays down that the direction of the Services is under the control of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the Australian people who sits in this Parliament and who is a Minister of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been requested by my parliamentary colleagues to bring before the notice of the House that the honourable Fred Daly, Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House, has today served 32 years in Parliament as a member and a Minister, having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a member for Martin, New South Wales, on 21 August 1943. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely what is notable about the conduct of this Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 and what we see exemplified in this Budget is the maladministration, the wasting, the extravagance and the many programs which were ill planned and impractical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December 1972, when the previous Government was first <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the pension for aged, widowed and invalid Australians was $20 a week or 20 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a question of the people of Australia and the people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the community- I am referring to all members of this Parliament- deciding whether extra money ought to be collected and whether that money ought to be spent on certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is, of course, that the system we propose is considerably less restrictive than that applying for Senate elections between 1919 and 1931, under which electors were required to express preferences for double the number of candidates to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, plus one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Queensland legislation is the same as the Federal legislation under which people who have nominated for public office and who have not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to it are allowed to go back to the Public Service positions from which they resigned in order to stand for public office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one of those members who came here in the group <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Representatives in 1974, it seems appropriate to look at some of the responsibilities that we have if we believe in upholding the role of Parliament and if we believe in selling ourselves and selling our system continuously to the community as being the best system that yet has been devised as a parliamentary democracy, observing the ways in which we are carrying out those duties, whether we are doing those duties successfully and whether the criticisms of parliaments and the inadequacies of our parliaments are the legitimate aim of people outside the Parliament who criticise the actions that we take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both sides accept the concept of a mixed economy, but this Government believes that it should be the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people- not big business, the multinationals and Australia’s own private bureaucracies- that should run this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In referring to these political difficulties, unprecedented in Australia, unparalleled in any comparable democracy, I retreat in no degree from our full responsibilities as the <span class="highlight">elected</span>, the re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is further evidence of our determination to fulfil those responsibilities- not just the responsibilities as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Government, but our responsibilities as a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a program of reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That principle is that in a parliamentary democracy the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people govern the country and when they refuse to do so they lose their right to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first was his statement that an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government is entitled to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable members opposite suggest that some court should have the power to say to the electors of Corangamite: ‘You should not have <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Mr Street;  he has been unfair and he cannot take his place in the Parliament.*? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is obvious and rests on the fragmentation, instability and indecisiveness which characterise every parliament which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a proportional representation basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I therefore come back to a third alternative, namely, the replacement of State-wide Senate constituencies by 5 constituencies within each State, each constituency with 2 senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> at alternate polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government in particular, when it <span class="highlight">elected</span>  Mr Field,  brought the convention on casual Senate vacancies to the point of destruction, and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  has asked very properly whether the convention has not been torn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are seriously to place parliamentary democracy in the hands of <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of Parliament we should certainly give them better accommodation, not sharing rooms two and three to a room, interrupting each other by way of telephone calls, interviews and other things, with inefficient systems of work and a lack of staff support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Balaclava spoke, as did the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury)  before him, about what happens when an honourable member reaches this chamber, but nobody spoke about what happens for an honourable member to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We also know that on 2 December 1972- not yet 3 years ago, and yet the Constitution states that the House of Representatives should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 3 years- the people of Australia chose a majority of members of the Australian Labor Party to govern in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Because the membership of the Upper House in New South Wales is not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, but is appointed, we have sitting in the other chamber here a person who may be described politically as a wether or a neuter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So long as they pursue their power hungry course those who are frustrated and who are not allowed to see their will as expressed at the ballot box run for 3 years as they believed it would in the government they <span class="highlight">elected</span>, will make their voices heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This must be done, as I say, for the sake of the safety and security of this country even when it means that an election is held at a time when the party <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power has had a shorter period in office than the term for which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One final remark I want to make is that if this Parliament does not learn to carry out its functions or is not capable of carrying out its functions or is not capable of carrying out the functions for which it has been <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and that includes the function of governing by a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people, other methods will be devised by people in the community who want things done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not take up much of the 10 minutes I have skirting those aspects of the Constitution which the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Crean)  raised except perhaps to remind him that it was the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  before the last election who was very fond of describing the then members of the Senate as yesterday’s men and men <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a certain number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition generally are deliberately trying to destroy the trust which should exist between the Public Service, the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government; in other words, the democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter of whether the Budget pleases the Senate; the point is that the Senate has no right at all to force any <span class="highlight">elected</span> government to the polls, not because it does not have a majority in this Chamber, not because it lacks a majority on the floor of the House of Representatives, not because it does not have the support of the people at an election but because it does not have the money to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee will recall that in 1972 the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  campaigned vigorously on the problems of urban transport, promising some $ 1 , 100m- I think that was the figure- to upgrade urban transport if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s attitude in taking away tax concessions from people who ploughed in money and risked it in oU and mineral exploration was one of the earliest signs that the Australian Government, which was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972, did not have its feet on the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I doubt whether many figures in public life who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives have attracted quite the amount of abuse and misrepresentation which has been the lot of Elizabeth Reid ever since she was first appointed to the staff of the Prime Minister- an abuse which some of us noted culminating yesterday in the remarks of the Premier of Queensland,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the hollow opportunism of the present Opposition trying to use the Senate as an instrument with which to strike down a Government, in the same way as Lang’s opponents of those days used Governor Game through the British Colonial Office to strike down his <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that if they wanted to see action on the things they hatedAustralia’s involvement in Vietnam, conscription and tours of Australia by Springbok sporting teams and so on and so forth- the way to do it was to get behind the Labor movement and work and expand their energies in getting us <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was honoured to know Cyril from the time I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place in May 1955.I formed a very firm friendship with Cyril for the 3 years or so he was in Parliament after that and, of course, during the time he was employed in the Commonwealth Public Service later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The percentages of votes it has received in Senate elections have been represented pretty closely by the percentage of senators it has had <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In arriving at that quota you take into consideration the number of formal votes cast and also the number of candidates who are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also states that a vote will be classified as formal providing the ballot paper is filled in with the total numbers in accordance with the number of senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In previous debates not one member of the Government has said- I hope the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan),  who is at the table, understands the matter and will give me an explanation- what will eventually be the quota after the first three senators or even the first 4 senators out of a team of five are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to say anything more about that matter other than that I hope that the Minister will be able to give me a firm assurance that senators so <span class="highlight">elected</span> under this scheme will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the same number of votes as Nos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So our first and primary point in advocating that Australia should retain the full preferential system is that it is a fair system which results in each elector having a say in who is to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government seeks to implement a system whereby fewer nonLabor candidates are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one compares the percentages of votes that are cast for the Australian Labor Party with the percentages of Labor Party candidates who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> one will find that the percentages are pretty close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first place, Senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> State by State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible under that system for a candidate who obtains a minority of the votes- that is, 40 per cent of the total votes cast or even 35 per cent of those votes- to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, 53 per cent of the people who voted in that poll did not want Garland although he is declared <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister had interjected but he cannot gainsay the fact that if we have an optional preferential system, if we have 3 candidates, and if only half of the number of persons who voted for the third candidate express a preference, it is possible for the victorious candidate to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> with less than 50 per cent of the primary or subsequent preference votes of the people taking part in the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What this Bill would do would be to make it harder for the individual to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and to make things more difficult for all parties other than the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a Senate election the number of candidates endorsed by a party is to be not less than one-quarter of the number of senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, when such a person is <span class="highlight">elected</span> it is usually for an important political reason and the consequences of such elections have been important ones in Australia’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, we do not know until they have stood and the votes are gathered whether they are going to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, but I believe the Minister is trying to prejudge the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rich and the privileged Leader of the Opposition wants government by big business, not government by properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I challenge the Leader of the Opposition now to deny honourable members opposite need not laugh that he told colleagues that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government he would abolish the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the courts and that he would reconstitute them with people of his own choosing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I wish to make one or two comments about the speech which has just been delivered by my old friend, the honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Duthie),  who was a member of the House of Representatives in 1949 when I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has twice faced the ballot box- in 1972 when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a tragedy and a disgrace that the fate of a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government should depend on the whim of an individual who is controlled by vested interests including the Press barons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the honourable course to follow- to retreat from his incredibly dangerous position and make a clear declaration that he will allow the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia to get on with the business of governing free from the threat of Senate obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should make a clear declaration- not one hedged with fine print; not one covered in ifs and buts, but a clear declaration that the Government can get on with the job it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia- the Government solely because the people gave us a majority in this House- must now so conduct ourselves that this act of aggression by the Senate shall never again be attempted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not only a matter of upholding past conventions which go to the very foundation of parliamentary democracy; it is a matter of establishing the principle beyond all doubt for the future, for all time- not just for this twenty-ninth Parliament, but for all future Australian Parliaments; not just for this <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, but for all future <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments of Australia; and, may I say, not just for the present Prime Minister but for all future Prime Ministers of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to govern for a further 3 years, until 1977, and that is the Government’s expectation and intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have the extraordinary spectacle of the Opposition, apparently recognising that it has failed to blackmail me into an election for the House of Representatives, seeking to bring reprehensible pressure to bear on the GovernorGeneral, the representative of the Queen of Australia, to achieve that very thing, and to do so by dismissing me as Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who twice in less than 3 years has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> with a majority in the governing house and who continues to have a majority in that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From 2 December 1972 the freely <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of this country, <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the same system as every other government, that is, <span class="highlight">elected</span> to serve for 3 years, has never been free from threat from the Opposition which has never been prepared to see itself as an Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their proposition is that the Government should make it easy for them and that the Government should deny those who <span class="highlight">elected</span> it and should now give the Opposition the opportunity, if it can, to mislead the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals, by conniving, by distorting the ballot papers and by arranging for excess numbers of candidates, with no possible hope of and no interest in being <span class="highlight">elected</span>, were able to get an increase in the informal vote thereby gaining a better position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone knows that if by a miracle- and miracles have not really been performed since the year 1 A.D.- the Government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> again we will move from problem to problem, from disaster to disaster, from stagflation to what could easily be regarded as one of the worst disasters we have ever faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might make the point that in 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government no tangible steps were taken towards responsible government or the giving of powers to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a House which has representation <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a different sort of basis, where all States, regardless of size, have the same number of senators, so that in very small States a small number of voters can ensure equal representation with the very large States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Westminster system of government which has served this nation well since Federation just cannot endure if a de facto second government, not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people as the Government, but self-appointed, seeks to operate in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on the Government side know quite well that the Prime Minister was in no doubt that the Senate had the power and that if he could have mustered the numbers in the Senate he would have destroyed the Budget of 1970 and the Government of 1970- a Government that had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> in October 1 969 and was then 10 months old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister realise that the promise of open government was one of the main reasons why this Government was mistakenly <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office by the Australian people- a mistake that they are anxiously waiting to rectify? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are asserting the right of the people of Australia against a government which has demonstrated deliberate dishonesty; a government which has demonstrated through its Prime Minister a different standard for himself from that which he expects of his ministers; a government which has demonstrated gross illegality in overseas loan raisings and total impropriety in the premature release of Budget papers to persons who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people and who are not subjected to the normal constraints applied to <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people, be they State Premiers or Opposition representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I have considerable doubts as to whether or not a committee of three, all of whom as the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  has pointed out are to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Government, is in any sense fair to the industry itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time positive recognition is being given to the authority of the States in a meaningful spirit of federalism and accountability, for the spending and raising of money will rest to a marked degree with the people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to fulfil the requirements of the Constitution as originally envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government had not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> for more than a few months when the Opposition plotted to withdraw Supply from it and to stop its flow of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not distraught as those opposite are by the High Court having held what would obviously have been the case in the minds of most honourable gentlemen, that senators may be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Territories and may vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Actually I was in the Northern Territory over the weekend and I was impressed by the sense of outrage among people there at the National Country Party’s antics on this question of senators being <span class="highlight">elected</span> for the Territories because they had not forgotten that Country Party and Liberal Party senators had on 4 occasions in 1973 and 1974 voted against citizens in the Northern Territory being allowed to choose senators- 4 occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is too much to think that they will have something to say, that not just appointed representatives but the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of the Northern Territory might have a right to voice their attitudes to these measures before they are passed into law through this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the aspects of this question is that at some time in the future, be it close or distant- it will not matter for these purposes because as I said earlier these Bills will have long term effectthe Northern Territory, although it be anathema to the Government, will probably be a State of the Commonwealth and those who are now the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the Legislative Assembly may well be members of a State parliament but certainly their successors will be and the statehood and the effect of these provisions on the statehood of the Northern Territory are very material matters to take into consideration in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are going to have an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body, but in some ways the idea of one man one vote or equal vote equal value, if I may use that phrase, is absolutely foreign to the Aboriginal concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question is not just whether this particular Government will be allowed to govern for the term for which it was <span class="highlight">elected</span>; the question is whether any duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government will be allowed to govern in the future if in its own right it does not also command a majority in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to the Senate, but at the last Senate election which was held at the same time as this House was <span class="highlight">elected</span> the people of Australia, the same electors who <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of this House, gave the Opposition Parties control of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to commend the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  who has experienced disappointment today in not being <span class="highlight">elected</span> as  Speaker,  for the service he gave in the previous Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second is that I believe we face a responsibility in view of the number of members who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the government side to see that members of this Parliament accept their responsibility as representatives of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In no other democracy in the world could a  president  or a head of state dismiss an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government with half of its term to serve, a Prime Minister and a Government with a secure majority in the People’s House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor Government had been sacked, still showed a vote in which the ALP had the majority among the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government was under constant pressure for an election within 24 hours of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972, and it was under that pressure that it endeavoured to operate during its 3 years of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is possible that under normal election circumstances the Liberal-Country parties would have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel privileged because I stand here having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent over 100 000 people of the electorate of Evans, an inner western suburb electorate of Sydney which contains a crosssection of the Australian people and therefore represents the aspirations and hopes of the Australian people as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable members on the other side of the House and the shadowy figures that control them, the tiny minority who think they have a God given right to decide which party will form the government, that the Labor movement is united as it never has been before and we will not forget the shameful train of events in which one individual, an individual who was not even responsive to the views of the sovereign he allegedly represents, decreed that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government was to be replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will keep the fire burning for the next 3 years and we will once more assume our place on the Government benches to carry out the job that we were twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That requirement is the obligation- I believe the electorate and the Australian people in general feel this way also -on governments, when <span class="highlight">elected</span>, to maintain full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that the principal requirements of this Government that has just been <span class="highlight">elected</span> are twofold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great many people in Australia feared very much, when that Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, that it was going to go back much further than 30 years, perhaps well into the 1 9th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia the Senate is a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the same people who elect the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Senate is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a basis of proportional representation whereas the House of Representatives is <span class="highlight">elected</span> on an electorate basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are both <span class="highlight">elected</span>, as I have said, by the same people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States apparently <span class="highlight">elected</span> to have that level of unemployment, unacceptable though it is, in order to have a more acceptable rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The capacity for each level of government to truly represent the people and to make decisions which they have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to make is the crux. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> honourable member for Canberra  (Mr Haslem)  understands clearly the pressure that these measures will cause here in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people and the people are dictating the terms at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Firstly, I should like to offer my congratulations to you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the high office which you hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any government has faced greater frustrations than those faced by the Whitlam Labor Government after it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw a Government that was twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office ejected from office by the actions of the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, we extend our congratulations to you,  Sir, and  to all other honourable members who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> as officers of this honourable House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to observe as we do in our prayers our duty to God, to stand up for the things which are right, to serve the people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> me here, to work for the Australian people as long as I am in this Parliament and above all to support and care for the traditions of this honourable House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and again we see the Press campaign of denigration of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of the Parliament, whoever he may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaign then really started in earnest to bring about the defeat of the twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result of this maniacal Press exercise of power was the dismissal of the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new Government was subsequently <span class="highlight">elected</span> by what we call a democratic election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important issue is whether the Central Intelligence Agency has been operating in Australia covertly to topple a legitimately <span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been established as a fact that the CIA has been involved in activities to topple legitimately <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments in other parts of the world, so why not in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that these investigations will establish that the United States of America Central Intelligence Agency has engaged in covert activities in Australia over a long period which eventually led to the destruction of a legitimately <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The key to the Arabian treasure chest was produced, he said, at a private luncheon in his home soon after Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that this 2-airline policy has bugged every Minister responsible for civil aviation who has handled this question ever since I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament in 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it recognises that a government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia has a moral right at least- a de facto right, at any rate- to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there are weighty reasons for disregarding the viewpoint of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, the Commission, I believe, ought to listen to what the Government has to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had no sooner been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government when his Minister for Science countermanded the instruction that I had given that the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation should have on it one representative of the CSIRO officers and scientists and staff representatives to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people employed by the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s Address was also different in that the Opposition members did not attend the opening of the Parliament to which they were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been the bleat by people opposite since they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> and during the course of the election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard the argument put that one cannot draw a parallel between the House of Representatives in Australia and the House of Commons in Britain because the Parliament of Australia has as its House of review or upper House an <span class="highlight">elected</span> chamber, whereas the British Parliament has an appointed house as its House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder just how <span class="highlight">elected</span> is the Senate, how <span class="highlight">elected</span> are the 64 people who now make up that chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a half Senate election there are 5 senators to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in each of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So 4 people are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> from each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in a half Senate situation only 6 senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a full chamber there are only 12 <span class="highlight">elected</span> senators, the other 52 being appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not true to say that the Senate is a truly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either those on the other side believe that there was no constitutional crisis; either they believe that the GovernorGeneral at any time can willy-nilly dismiss the government of the day- a government properly <span class="highlight">elected</span>, properly in office, never having acted illegally- or they must concede that there was a constitutional crisis that had to be resolved by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> member to this House I am fully aware of the position I hold in helping to shape the events of the nation and of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This world was different in 1975 even from 1965, and certainly from 1955 when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that in a democratic society with a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament, with both Houses <span class="highlight">elected</span> on adult suffrage, the issues which were before the Parliament may not have had the right of carriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the editors of a newspaper referred the other day to the fact that this was the first time that a government had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> without having to produce a program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst my interest in rural affairs probably stems only from when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1969 and a period prior to that, at least I can go back to that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year he and his cousin devised a plan to overthrow the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government commanding a majority in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-by leave- This Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office at a time when the Australian economy is experiencing the results of its most serious setback in the post-war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It consisted of 58 <span class="highlight">elected</span> and 2 appointed members and neither of the appointed members represented the Party to which the senators whose places they filled had belonged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also raises the question of the rights of parliamentary democracy to prevail without the intrusion by individuals who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of this country and to protect the rights of parliamentarians to carry out their obligations to the people who elect them without interference from the Commonwealth police or any other organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the committee elect as  Deputy Chairman  one of the members nominated by the Leader of the Opposition being a member from a different House than the  Chairman,  and that the member so <span class="highlight">elected</span> act as  Chairman  of the committee at any time when the  Chairman  is not present at a meeting of the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Menzies conservative Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1949 and it was not until 1972 that they started a decentralisation policy, the setting up the National Urban and Regional Development Authority 2 weeks before it was defeated in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential that not only should the Australian people be aware and kept informed of the world around us and the circumstances, which change daily, but that the men and women who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament with the fundamental responsibility of leading the Australian people and of setting a standard of excellence and an appreciaton of the problems which this nation must face, should ensure that this Committee has indeed a real role to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us face it: The Assembly had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> for 13 months during the term of the Labor Government and it did not give the Assembly constitutional responsibility either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir, I  go a stage further: Not only am I glad that he has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that position but I also appreciate the clarity with which he expresses himself when he is speaking to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many new Australians in the Newcastle region of the Hunter electorate cannot understand how one man can dismiss the popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> people’s government; they cannot understand how it can be destroyed by one man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was an election for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory, at which the Australian Labor Party was wiped out as a political entity in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the face of those policy statements I say again that it is imperative for the Government to take the Northern Territory into its confidence, that is, through its <span class="highlight">elected</span> leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the power of Opposition members in the Senate to destroy the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government at will is not eliminated then the long term consequences of such a capricious and politically motivated power to destroy will itself destroy all vestiges of stability and certainty in Australian government and administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a perversion of the very nature of representative democracy that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people can be hamstrung in their task of government by just those men that the people have rejected as potential administrators of the nation ‘s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During its period in office as a twice <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, the Australian Labor Party sought to implement programs for a more just and equitable distribution of wealth within the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the myths on which Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 was that it had a special relationship with the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it does represent another attempt on the part of communism in this country to take foreign policy decisions out of the hands of the properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government and into the streets and the backrooms of the Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The records of  Hansard  are full of speeches by new members preoccupied with these considerations, but it is a clear matter of fact that the predicament has never been more acute than when the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on 13 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly, we must give Australians the priority because that is why we are <span class="highlight">elected</span>; that is why we are here and it is our prime responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very sad that an <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of this House, representing the independent democratic people of Australia, should deny that same independence, that some democratic right, to our neighbours in Portuguese East Timor, which is only 300 miles from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this matter needs to be looked at in the context that the Governor-General- an appointed person, not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> person- is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is an appointed person, not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> person, as is the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the GovernorGeneral of Australia has assumed the power to make sure that he could dismiss a constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I say that it is well and truly time that the Constitution of Australia was revised to make it very clear that in the future no GovernorGeneral can take the action of dismissing a constitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, it should be made clear that in the future no Governor-General- an appointed person, not an <span class="highlight">elected</span> person- shall hold the position of Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, a position which could be abused, a position which is very dangerous for an appointed person- not a person who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia, a person who finally depends upon the confidence of the people of Australia, but a person whom frankly I do not trust- to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I believe that action is very necessary indeed to overhaul the Constitution of this country, to make sure that in future the Prime Minister, as the <span class="highlight">elected</span> head of Government, is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, not a person appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the United States it is the  President,  an <span class="highlight">elected</span> person, who is the CommanderinChief of the Armed Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the power of the Senate, which is <span class="highlight">elected</span> every 6 years- with the exception of the case of a double dissolution, each senator is <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a period of 6 years- was curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, there could be senators <span class="highlight">elected</span> today who would hold office for 6 years, while a new government will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the House of Representatives in 3 years’ time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I believe that the Governor-General should not hold the office of commander-in-chief of the armed forces and I believe that action should be taken by the Government to ensure that an <span class="highlight">elected</span> person is placed in that very onerous position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">elected</span> person should make the decision as to whether the armed forces shall be used or, to use the vernacular, whether the button shall be pressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> member of this Parliament I know that I have a lot to learn about government and I respect the greater experience which I know lies concealed under the grey eminences- and some not so grey- around me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before one attains the honour and privilege of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> as a member of this House there are usually some people who hold public office and whom one hopes to emulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also thank the electors of the Federal division of Brisbane for the great honour and privilege of being their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even today the overwhelming majority of Australians who supported or even opposed the Whitlam-led Labor Government are stunned and dumbfounded at the role the people’s House plays in financial matters and at that power being usurped by the undemocratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some might say that the members of the other chamber who took on themselves this power to block the supply of finance which is necessary to run the various government departments of this great country were democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> but when one remembers the appointments of  Senator Field  of Queensland and  Senator Bunton  of New South Wales it is hard to understand how anyone could come to that conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were not the choice of the people of those States, how could it be claimed that they were democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The democratic system of this country has reached a very low level if people can be appointed to the Senate by State governments and then have the power to block the supply of finance approved by this House of Representatives a House in which each member is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the wishes and the votes of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General failed to inform the nation why that singular power held by the House of Representatives was allowed to be sidetracked and subverted by an undemocratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Senate, a hostile Senate that constitutionally has no power to initiate money Bills or even to amend money Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of advice on this matter by the GovernorGeneral the electors, in my opinion, are forced to assume that the people’s House- the House of Representatives- has power relating to money Bills only on the basis of good faith by a Senate composed of senators not <span class="highlight">elected</span> but nominated by State political leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see problems for Canberra, as for other areas of development and enterprise, over the next year or so; but I am confident that this period of enforced consolidation is what the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> me see as being needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a big issue like this- one of the most important issues affecting his electorate and probably the most important issue that has affected his electorate since he was <span class="highlight">elected</span>- he cannot even get in touch with one of his Ministers, let alone the Prime Minister, to find out whether the project is to go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As promised, this Government, immediately on being <span class="highlight">elected</span>, began moves towards executive responsibility for the Legislative Assembly based on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Northern Territory which inquired into constitutional development in the Northern Territory- recommendations which were available to the previous government for 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Liberal and National Country Party people are going to find, of course, and as they have included in so many of their statements, is that if we are to have responsible government in this country, if there is to be proper economic planning in this country, if we are to avoid many of the problems which are thrust upon other countries, when a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> it must see out its term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it wants politicians to perform the tasks for which they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> they must have the resources, and the media must stop carping about the so-called benefits and perks given to politicians to carry out their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would therefore press strongly that the Government does not forget that in 1972 the Liberal Party was able to promise abolition of the means test by the end of 1975 if it had then been <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report recommended the steady devolution of executive autonomy for the Territory Assembly- a body which is now an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body thanks to the initiative of the former Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann)  made reference in his second reading speech to the Labor Party’s initiative for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly but went on to say: ‘The promises and assurances were speedily forgotten and the Assembly ignored . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Labor Government carried this concept further to a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I admit that the Labor Government did institute an election for a fully <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly but then it sat down and did nothing during the next 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I compliment the present majority leader and executive members in the Legislative Assembly on their responsible attitude to the awkward situation in which they found themselves when <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office, albeit with a 17 to nil majority over the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such an attitude can only involve a blatant breach of faith in that the Liberal-National Country Party spokesman for Aboriginal Affairs during the last election, the present AttorneyGeneral telegraphed all Aboriginal communities with the unequivocal assurance that there would be no cuts in the Aboriginal affairs budget or in the Aboriginal affairs program if a LiberalNational Country Party government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter giving concern is the Government’s vacillation about the role of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee which was established by the Labor Administration and which comprises 41 <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of Aboriginal electorates throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what remains absolutely certain- I made this point yesterday- is that the result of 3 years of Labor government lifted unemployment from 136 000 when Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to 328 000 when it went out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A political strike is one in which the union uses the strike weapon to cause such dislocation to the economy or inconvenience to the population that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government is under great pressure to concede the political decision that the union is urging upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 13 December last year they chucked the Labor Party well and truly out of office, and <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Liberal-National Country Party Government with a mandate to get Australia back on to sound economic ground and to run the country as managers and not as amateurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most Australians were hoping that a Budget would be brought down that would in some way dim the memory of the blot on the history of our democratic way of life- a Budget that would in some way justify the sacking of a duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having spent the last weekend in my electorate in central Queensland I am pleased to be able to report to the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  that the Budget has a large degree of support in that area- with the exception, of course, of one or two <span class="highlight">elected</span> members in that area who belong to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great weakness of  Mr Whitlam  ‘s speech was its failure to recognise that the Budget tried to do what the coalition was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to do: fix up the economy; cut Government spending; reduce taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action of the Senate in cutting off the supply of money to the Government earlier in the year established a dangerous precedent that will invite future Opposition majorities in the Senate to strike down the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government at any time they choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Properly <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments planning a 3-year program will in future always be confronted with the knowledge that when an unpopular but proper measure is just beginning to produce the desired results, the Opposition could suddenly attempt to cash in on temporary public hostility to grab the reins of Government The behaviour of the present Opposition Parties proves beyond doubt that they have no respect for the institution of Parliament or of the right of the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> the Government <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again he draws a distinction from Westminster which is quite specious, that the House of Lords is appointed and the Senate <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple fact is that society, through the government of the day, <span class="highlight">elected</span> to establish a universal health scheme and the present Government, through its pre-election undertaking not to dismantle the scheme, has effected such modification so as to ensure that the scheme will not consume the economy as has been the case in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In keeping with the whole Government approach- restraint in all areas- this Budget has shown that, whereas the Labor Government may have made some mistakes in attempting to stimulate development in areas which have been stultified for 20 years, the only positive actionthis is a rather Irish approach, I guess- the present Government has taken has been to stifle every initiative the Labor Government put forward, every initiative the Australian community voted for, and every initiative we talked about in the period from about 1968 onwards until we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> which clearly excited the Australian community and prompted people to vote for a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should well be remembered that Salvador Allende, a man <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office with only 36 per cent of the popular vote, proceeded, upon his election, on a deliberate program to disrupt, overturn and destroy Chile’s traditional institutions and resorted to illegal methods in violation of that country’s constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise, of course, that this nation is attempting to do what a previous non-Labor Government attempted in the United Kingdom, but we are doing it much more successfully and for one very clear reason, that is, that when the Heath Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with almost a 50/50 majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall not go into the details of what happened between December 1972 and December 1975 except to say that on numerous occasions items of legislation that had been passed by this, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> House, were refused a passage by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even after the people of Australia had re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> the Labor Government, the Senate, with the majority of members representing parties that were the minority in this House, continued to frustrate our legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, out of the blue, one man- a man who was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> to his position and who, as far as I know, has never run in an election in his life; if he has run in any, he has not won any- made a decision to dismiss the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government of Australia which had faced the people in December 1972 and May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The actions of the Senate had caused a constitutional crisis and one man made a decision to dismiss the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Cabinet agrees on those recommendations- it is that <span class="highlight">elected</span> Ministry which must have the final say- those plans about growth rates must be converted into energy needs, manpower needs, immigration needs and education needs in order to make decisions on what should be the key industries, decisions on the protection of full employment in this country and decisions in many other related areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know, if our <span class="highlight">elected</span> government decides on a 4 per cent growth rate, what this means in terms of energy needs, in terms of allocation of resources to the various areas in our economy and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For over 30 years in South Australia we suffered not a gerrymander but what was termed a playmander, in that 2 representatives from the country had to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for every representative from the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was the situation right up until 1965 and, in fact, after Labor was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of all the fears which over the years were driven into country people, we now find that the House of Assembly is to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the basis of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is in spite of the charge or allegation that it will take 54 per cent of the vote to have the Liberal Country League <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, recent accurate analyses of voting figures show quite clearly that only twice in its record period of office of 32 years was the Playford Government <span class="highlight">elected</span> with a minority of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, it is the fault of the Government which prevailed for 23 years in office before the Labor Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is sad that it has taken 10 months for this Government to get back to where it was when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and that it had to use these political opportunities to score off the most deprived and depressed people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim of the Leader of the Opposition in promoting regionalism was not to establish <span class="highlight">elected</span> systems of government at regional levels or to preserve local government at the local level or to support the States, but rather to set up an administrative network based upon regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  aim was to replace the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative in local government and the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative in State government by a Federal bureaucrat who would be instructed to follow the guidelines of policy determined by a single parliament here in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Though it can serve a useful purpose, I think the House will agree that this form of public participation is not as effective as that which should be encouraged to take place between concerned citizens and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> local councillor is not only more willing, but also more able to respond to the wishes of the community than a bureaucrat appointed and controlled by a central legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am suggesting that the very body which this Bill nominates- the Australian Council of Local Government Associations-should suggest the method by which local government <span class="highlight">elected</span> persons in each State should themselves elect a representative for themselves on the Advisory Council for InterGovernment Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the sudden and violent  coup d’etat  which has resulted in the overthrow of Thailand’s democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government, is the Minister aware that many Thai students now in Australia are deeply concerned that their lives or safety might be endangered if they were forced to return to Thailand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem that activity in the armed Services is certainly not going to burgeon forth, as the Minister for Defence would have had us believe before he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to his ministerial office, and as he has implied very heavily with those rather dramatic metaphors that he uses from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apparently the present Prime Minister had forgotten his comment of 2 years previously as to the considerable length to which the Labor Government was going to ensure that union officials were properly and democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, in so doing it has reneged on its stated pre-election intention of ensuring that union officials were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps if they are not all abashed by what their Government is doing, they can contemplate the prospect of explaining to Liberal and National Country Party members and supporters outside this House why it is that they are passing legislation which will allow the National  President  of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a ballot not of 1.8 per cent of the membership, as occurred last time, but in a ballot of 0.02 pier cent of the membership, if the AMWU decided to opt for the collegiate system which this legislation will now provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further unsavoury aspect of this legislation which should also be mentioned is the change in the definition of ‘office ‘ which will enable unions to appoint persons to positions in the union which are similar to <span class="highlight">elected</span> positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By having a onetier collegiate system of the type referred to by the honourable member for Gellibrand, State representatives would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file people in those States and the representatives from those States would have the right and authority to elect their senior federal office bearers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that he has simply tried to equate the collegiate system with the system under which senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he think that people are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as officials of unions simply because they stand for election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should know that people are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as officials of trade unions because of their known capacity, a capacity that is known by the members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons, it is sheer hogwash to say for example, because a general secretary of a union is <span class="highlight">elected</span> from New South Wales that he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> from that State simply because there are more people in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The brutal force of numbers or all sorts of persuasive means could be used to influence members of a college to change their vote so that it would not reflect the vote of those who <span class="highlight">elected</span> them- their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They should not be muzzled by this Government in connivance with the National Civil Council so that all that is heard is the voice of those who are <span class="highlight">elected</span>, those that they have <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Federal members of the Australian Labor Party are pre-selected under a system involving a body of 70 people at a preselection convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 40 members of the Public Office Selection Committee are chosen from 100 members of the Public Office Selection Committee who in turn are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a State Conference of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So between the membership of the Labor Party and the members who are pre-selected we have 3 tiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the case of the 30 members of the Federal Electorate Assembly the situation is not so bad because those 30 people are at least selected by the branch members within a federal electorate area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we have a major portion of that body <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a 3-tier collegiate system it ill becomes honourable members opposite to complain about this Government introducing the option of a one-tier collegiate system into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also was pre-selected under a pre-selection system involving a one-tier collegiate structure and I have no complaints about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the purposes of the application of the definition of “collegiate electoral system” in sub-section ( 1 ) in relation to an election for an office in an organisation, an electoral system that otherwise complies with that definition shall be deemed to comply with that definition notwithstanding that the persons comprising a body of persons by and from whom persons are <span class="highlight">elected</span> at any stage subsequent to the first stage include persons (not exceeding in number 15 per centum of the total number of the body) who are the holders of offices entitling the holders to membership of that body (which may include the office to which the election relates) but are not  members  of that body by virtue of an election in accordance with that definition, being persons each of whom has held such an office (whether the one office or not) at all times since being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to such an office under a collegiate electoral system, or a direct voting system, as defined in sub-section (1)’”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In explanation of the second amendment, which is the substantive one, I point out to the Committee that in relation to the one-tier collegiate system of voting an unqualified requirement that persons <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a college must also be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the members of that college can be disadvantageous to organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those office bearers must have been originally <span class="highlight">elected</span> to those positions under a collegiate electoral system or a direct voting system as defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, they must have held office- not necessarily the same office- continuously since being first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of full-time officers the office bearers would be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by and from a college, the members of which, excepting office bearers in the 15 per cent category must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> directly by the appropriate sections of the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the same qualifications, part-time officers must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> under a collegiate system based on elections to a college by direct vote of the appropriate sections of the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that this amendment makes a substantial difference to the definition of ‘collegiate electoral system’ and will allow the operation of a system which will mean not only that some union officials will not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> indirectly by the members but also that some union officials will not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by members even directly or indirectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of collegiate electoral system’ in clause 3 of the Bill states that the officers of a union must be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by and from the college and to get on to the college the officers have to have been voted for in a rank and file ballot in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that if officials of a union want to continue to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in order to become Federal secretary, or whatever, they have to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the college and face a rank and file ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government by this amendment is now allowing officers of unions to avoid having to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can just be added to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the college, as they are now in the Federated Clerks Union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association and other unions which have a collegiate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These officers, by being added to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members, form a college which then elects the officers, and so the officers become virtually selfperpetuating, particularly where they represent the difference between 2 factions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of allowing this amendment through, the 4 officers of a union will be allowed to be added to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the college and by that means to form a college for their re-election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far the Government is from the days when it was saying: ‘Look at this terrible Dick Scott, the National President of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, who is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by only 1.8 per cent of the members’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Government intends to allow the AMWU, if it so wishes, to provide for a collegiate system in which Dick Scott and Laurie Carmichael, the Assistant Secretary and another  bete noire  of this Government, can just add themselves to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Federal Council of the union for the purpose of determining a college and thereby having themselves re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is the most astonishing thing of all time to come from this Government which went to the people and had as one of its biggest planks that it was going to democratise trade unions and ensure that union officials were <span class="highlight">elected</span> in a way which meant that they had to face their members, which said that it would arm every union member with a ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This application says that the rules of the Federated Clerks Union which currently allow for officers to be added to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Federal Council for the purposes of forming an electoral college for the election of the officers, in fact are oppressive, unreasonable and unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I make the point that  Mr Maynes  has not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal Council for 22 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a perfect example of a person who, once having been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Federal Council and having become the Federal  President,  is being perpetuated in that position, without having to face the rank and file since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Within our society and within the world at large there are many different ways in which persons can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in organisations or even nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reservation about the legislation that I have is that there may be circumstances in which persons who have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by what I consider a sensible and reasonable compromise system all round, may not have their removal equated to the same criteria as their election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party seems to forget that before a person can become ah officer he must firstly be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file to the college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in the main, a person has to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the college by the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that a member must first be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill states that people <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office shall be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by and from the college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It talks about people being <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the college, 1 5 per cent of whom are eligible to stand but they are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file who are eligible to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that means that 100 per cent of the college is <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file then I am surprised that the honourable member, who I understand is a practitioner in law, does not understand the words and the language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  was wrong in his assumption that anyone could be appointed to a college without first being <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the office bearers of a trade union should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and that the rank and file members of the union should have an influence on the office bearers of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The unbelievable system the Government is introducing means that 1 5 per cent of the collegiate need no longer be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the rank and file after they have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> once. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that, under the collegiate system, rank and file members have the prime say, just as they have the prime say in the selection of those who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to either side of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is going to introduce a system whereby, as the honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Burr)  has indicated, the office holders who will sit under the collegiate system and who were only <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the first place will be able to perpetrate their position time and again with a 1 5 per cent start under the collegiate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of the Australian Labor Party, this is particularly important because, as my colleague interjects, its members in the Parliament are bound by the Party discipline and by policy laid down not by <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of Parliament but by machine men outside whose credentials are quite unknown to the voting public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I want to make is this: The Senate that refused to consider Supply was not the Senate that was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were 2 members of the Senate at that time who had been appointed by State parliamentsquite improperly- to replace 2 <span class="highlight">elected</span> Australian Labor Party senators, one of whom had died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parties of honourable members opposite conspired to rig the Senate by stacking it with people who could not get <span class="highlight">elected</span> and who could not get the votes of the Australian people and utilised the votes of those people who were dishonestly appointed by State governmentshonourable members opposite do not know much about honesty- in order to acquire the numbers to defeat an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We took our stand on 11 November on a simple issue: Is a government with a majority in a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> House of Representatives to be allowed to govern, or is it not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The defence of the Senate’s action rests on the proposition that the Senate is a popularly <span class="highlight">elected</span> House and, except in certain limited matters specified in the Constitution, enjoys equal powers with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a parody of democracy to assert that a govenment must be responsible to a chamber <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a grossly unequal system of representation; a chamber whose numbers can be varied, and have indeed been varied, by State Premiers without regard to the electors’ will; whose members at some times have been chosen 3 years or 6 years before the members of this House, and who can bring about an election for the House of Representatives without having to face an election themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the people coming onto the streets in the United States of America, in Britain and other countries around the world and questioning the right of those who had been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government to take decisions and the morality of those decisions that forced governments as powerful as the Government of the United States to withdraw its troops from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note, when one looks at the bitterness which has existed there and which, to some extent, still exists there, why militants or communists are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the men to fill positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was a member of the Victorian teaching service when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the history of a member of the Victorian teaching service who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Victorian Parliament in 1947 or 1948, He was a member of a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Subsequently in 1952 a Labor government was returned and it set to work to change the legislation so that people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Victorian Parliament from the Victorian Public Service would be able to return to their jobs with all rights reserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, just before I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament, the Act was changed- as a matter of fact it was a good piece of behaviour by a Liberal government- so that people <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Australian Parliament would be able to return to their jobs up to a period of 9 years after their election with all their rights reserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I suggest to the Ministry that it immediately examines the situation in Victoria and places in the Australian Public Service Act, the provisions which permit members of the Public Service <span class="highlight">elected</span> to a parliament to be able to return to the Public Service upon defeat or retirement with their rights reserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In proposed section 31(1), at the end of proposed paragraph (b) add the following words: “of whom one shall be the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Marius  Webb was <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the ABC staff as its representative on the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am absolutely staggered that provision for a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner is not to be included in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One problem is that representation on a commission or a board of directors by, say, an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the staff or employees of an organisation can mean mere tokenism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know he is an appointed member and was not <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the present staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner is the only person who is, in some sense, responsible to an outside constituency to whom he reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that is one problem, I ask: If we have commissioners who are in some sense representative of outside bodies, do we have an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the consumers- Auntie ‘s Nieces and Nephews or whatever organisation we might have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen how the present incumbent, the <span class="highlight">elected</span> staff representative, in fact reports to his constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless I think it would be a mistake to write into the legislation a provision requiring a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very strange mixture If one had to specify the strangest amendment I suppose it would be that which proposes that a commissioner should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> from amongst the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was <span class="highlight">elected</span> from more than 30 candidates from all the ABC unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a recent staff meeting of 2000 ABC employees who reconfirmed their commitment to a staff-<span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He ought to stand to see whether he can be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke to that Opposition amendment which deals with the appointment of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff and pointed out that, while there had not been previous provision for this, it had been something that a previous Minister had allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept that they are any substitute for the worker or staff participation that we would get with a commissioner <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the staff of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I oppose the amendment but in doing so I want to make it quite clear- and I think it is well known in this place and outside- that I have fought and worked for the last 2 months to retain on the Australian Broadcasting Commission the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner <span class="highlight">elected</span> by a vote of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Staff Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never spoken one word to him, but he is the duly <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative of the ABC Staff Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It need not necessarily be a separately <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr Webb,  who was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, is paid as a commissioner and as a staff member of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government rejects as unnecessary the amendment moved by the Opposition in relation to a staff <span class="highlight">elected</span> commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, each meeting <span class="highlight">elected</span> 3 representatives to form a protem committee which was to consider ways and means of establishing a Confederation of Australian Sport and then to convene a further meeting to discuss the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the Marxist orientated government was democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> whereas the present group of ruling thugs was not, does not concern him or any of the sabre-rattling individuals on that side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1967, he became Minister for Industrial Development and Company Affairs and, 3 years later, Food Minister which he remained until <span class="highlight">elected</span> President in August 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Whitiam Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972 there were 139,000 people out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the voters <span class="highlight">elected</span> a Government which is dedicated to increasing the freedom of the individual and the respect of his basic rights as an individual, while at the same time exercising its responsibility as a Government to protect and to assist those in our community who cannot care adequately for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives a degree of power to the  Chairman  which has never been envisaged by any <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the political influence will reside not with <span class="highlight">elected</span> politicians but with permanent heads who already have power to appoint to all positions below the First Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I cannot see the relevance of that interjection from my friend because the man has been democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Parliament by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are going to tell me that the people of the electorate of Ballaarat should not have <span class="highlight">elected</span> Jim Short simply because he came out of the Treasury I would suggest that argument is of the highest absurdity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who were not responsible, were not <span class="highlight">elected</span> and were not subject to recall by the people were given power and they abused that power tremendously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not think that anybody should seriously consider the proposition that people who are not <span class="highlight">elected</span> and who are not subject to recall should be given great powers in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that this Bill strikes at a basic democratic aspect of our government and our Parliament in the handing over of power from the Parliament to public servants- at the handing over of power from <span class="highlight">elected</span> people, people who are subject to recall, to people who are appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that <span class="highlight">elected</span> people- Ministers in governments- cannot take responsibility for every decision that is made right down the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They tended to keep the power in the hands of the Parliament- in the hands of the Government and in the hands of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill tends to take the power out of the hands of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament and put it in the hands of public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill take away some of the responsibility of <span class="highlight">elected</span> people and give it to appointed people who are not responsible in the sense that they are not subject to recall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I think all members of this House should be very much aware that this Bill in fact represents an erosion of the power of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people, hands much more power than is necessary over to appointed permanent heads and gives them the opportunity of reinforcing their entrenched position within the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this Convention affirms the principle that a casual vacancy in the Senate which occurs by reason of the death of a  Senator or  the disqualification or resignation of a  Senator caused  by  bona fide  illness or incapacity, should, in order to maintain the principle of proportional representation and the wishes of the people of the State at the relevant Senate election, be filled by a member of the same political party as the  Senator whose  vacancy is to be filled, but in reaffirming this principle the Convention recommends that the Constitution be amended to provide that the person <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Houses of Parliament of the State should hold office for the balance of the term of the  Senator whose  place he is taking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An almost identical Bill was passed twice by the House of Representatives in the Parliament <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1972 and thus the proposal was able to be submitted and was submitted to the electors in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear, from the batch of Bills that we are debating, that it is likely that the Northern Territory, when it becomes a State, will have a functionary named a Governor, either appointed or <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To put the matter on its proper basis, the Labor Party basis, is it not intelligent and proper that a Senate should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as a House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motivation of the people when they cast their votes for the election for a House of Representatives election in accordance with the policies expressed by political parties would also flow to the Senate candidates being <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No senator would ever be a rubber stamp, nor should he be, but it is appropriate that he should be indicative of the type of person <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time as a government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is only one slight variation, and that is that in the case of a casual vacancy occurring as a result of a person <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the House of Assembly in Tasmania dying, resigning or being unable to hold his seat, his votes are in fact recounted and the next person who would have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> on his preferences takes office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should the senators not face the music at the same time as the members of the House of Representatives and why should the people of Australia not make a decision which will have the effect of putting into the Parliament contemporary representatives- I emphasise the word ‘contemporary’- <span class="highlight">elected</span> on precisely the same mandate on precisely the same day? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is reason to advance the argument that the persons chosen to be senators on occasions when the 2 Houses have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> together have been chosen on a more objective basis and that a broader perspective of choice on national policies is exercised even though people might primarily be electing a government in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my memory none has been able to whip up enthusiasm in the community for reasons why  Senator A  should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> instead of  Senator B. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In one recent Senate election an independent senator was <span class="highlight">elected</span> from Western Australia on a platform to abolish estate duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia a candidate was very nearly <span class="highlight">elected</span> on an education platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both houses have the power to form governments, when the electorate expresses its opinion both Houses should be <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best representation would come about- this is a personal view- if those sections of the Constitution which provide for 2 Houses were removed and proportionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> members sat in this House with members <span class="highlight">elected</span> under the House of Representatives procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because senators are <span class="highlight">elected</span> for long terms on a proportional basis a problem arises when a vacancy occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was in 1964 that the late  Senator Poulter  was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a casual vacancy was created to replace a senator <span class="highlight">elected</span> for a 6-year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seat held by the senator filling the casual vacancy would be lost and there would be a distortion of proportional representation for the remainder of that 6-year period because a senator who would not have een <span class="highlight">elected</span> on a quota system from one party is <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator Greenwood  was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It acts to the disadvantage of the Labor Party in this instance because in Victoria at an election due 6 senators would be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, four of whom would be from the Liberal and National Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising out of that and out of the death of  Senator Cohen  during that election,  Senator Brown  subsequently contested the election for senators at which six were <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a retiring appointed senator because he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> further up the list than sixth he lost his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there is no evidence at all, and I hope that the present senators would support me, that they are m any way inferior or constitute in total an inferior Senate than those senators who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> at single Senate elections in 1964, 1967 and 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity of saying what a high regard I have for the wise and learned ruling that was given in this House yesterday by the  Speaker  in which he confirmed the status of myself and other <span class="highlight">elected</span> Territorial representatives in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I must commend the  Speaker  on the very wise ruling he made yesterday and express our appreciation for it, even though we have been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by people and we represent people who are regarded by the High Court as something less than Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to refer to particular senators, but under the proposal if the seat of an independent candidate <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people is subsequently vacated, the Government or Parliament of the State he represented is responsible for filling his vacancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not many years after I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber in 1 960 there was a debate on a Bill which first dealt with restrictive trade practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that the State will be regarded as one division and the members, to the number as determined, will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> for that one division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason they do not worry about the people outside the metropolitan areas is that so many of their members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> in the metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> outside such areas do not have an opportunity to influence decisions to the extent that I feel they probably would influence them if they had the numbers to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, in the ordinary life of a Parliament there has to be a distribution of a State where the Constitution shows that that State is entitled to more or fewer divisions than it had at the time that Parliament was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope there could be no situation in which such an election could take place because, no matter how it was conducted, it would be a distortion of the process by which this House is normally <span class="highlight">elected</span> or expected to be <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst one can understand that people will support a welfare program, I assure him that one of the reasons that his Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1972 was that it had been out of office for 23 years and the Australian people had forgotten what it would mean to have a profligate socialist government on the treasury benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So they were lacking in foresight if they ever thought that people <span class="highlight">elected</span> from the Territories would always be pro-Labor, or what we might describe as being anti the LiberalNational Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would mean that <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives would probably not have a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the only real power that the people of the Australian Capital Territory have is through their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard people say that we are over-represented because we have 2 members of the House of Representatives, 2 senators and 18 <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The smallest degree of representation is to be found in New South Wales which has one <span class="highlight">elected</span> person for every 1182 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, the position here is that we have one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative for every 6000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet this man from Western Australia wants to deprive us even of that amount of representation, when in his State there is one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative for every 387 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that we have one <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative for almost every 6000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-He would be <span class="highlight">elected</span>, but his professional skills might not be as obvious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the honourable gentleman seen a report that a law lecturer in Western Australia is of the opinion that the complement of the New South Wales and South Australian members to this House was unconstitutionally <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the general election and that he is proposing to ask the High Court to declare those members’ election void and to order new elections in those States in elections to be held at large? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was a member of the Opposition, the hearings had to take place immediately but since this Government has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> it has taken 16 months to refer the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government on a lot of specious promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, it probably made good political sense for the Liberal and Country Parties, which had then not been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government, to support a much greater measure of assistance by way of overseas aid to the developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we are here and that is why the Australian people <span class="highlight">elected</span> us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course he eventually got <span class="highlight">elected</span> to leadership, perhaps on that issue more than any other, only to do another somersault as we witness in this latest announcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people and they disagree with the actions which are being taken by this Government in destroying the independent Bureau of Roads by failing to define its structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The councillors are democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> and they are saying to the Government: ‘What you are doing is atrocious’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the opinion of those democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> conservative councillors in my area where, fortunately, the people have the good sense to return Australian Labor Party members in both the State and Federal Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we have come a long way between 1 965, when the first Labor Government for 33 years was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and today when we would hope the final attempt by those who want to continue with the old, unjust laws has come to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that all the people in South Australia will now accept that it is right to have one vote one value in the House of Assembly and that it is right and correct in a bicameral system that the Legislative Council itself be <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the most just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the protection of the government <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of Australia is something about which this Parliament has a right to know and in which it has a right to be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One thing that is important to understand is this: Section 44 of the Constitution, in dealing with people who shall be incapable of being chosen- that is chosen or <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Houserefers in the relevant part to a person who is an undischarged bankrupt or who is insolvent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important first of all to note that if a person had taken the benefit prior to his becoming a member- that is to say, at a time prior to his electionthe fact that he had entered into a deed of arrangement in the strict sense to which I will refer subsequently, would not preclude him from being <span class="highlight">elected</span> because section 44 (iii) refers to an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is becoming a vital issue because no matter which party is in power, no matter which group has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> via the political process, there are some groups in our society holding key positions who are determined to make political decisions on behalf of the whole community without reference to and often in defiance of the parliamentary process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an opportunity for him and the fellow union bashers who sit with him to stand up and use the old, tired, worn-out phrases about political strikes, militant unions and communist union secretaries and to ignore all the time the fact that union leaders are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by union members and, I might add, are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to act in the best interests of those members, and without exception that is the case in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, part of the trouble is that our delegation at the United Nations seems to be too much concerned with getting on to committees and being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to various positions of importance at the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is asked to give an opinion on whether there is some national advantage in attaching ourselves to a grouping that is more in keeping with our geographical position than WEOG, the delegation immediately colours its advice to us by considering how the new grouping will affect its chances of being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to some committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having <span class="highlight">elected</span> to go that route, I think it is then a nonsense to reserve to the Minister the capacity to overturn individual decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he dared to arrange for the General Secretary and President of the AWU to be opposed I told him that he would never get to the finishing post because his opponents would find some way of expelling him and his mate so that the General Secretary and President could be re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> unopposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All such a study would do would be to reveal, in very stark measure indeed, the simple fact- a fact unknown to the honourable gentleman-that this Government’s economic policies are working well and are a consequence of our adherence to a consistent economic program since we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office in late 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result of the Prime Minister’s rush to judgment before next year’s jobs crisis and economic decline is that the incoming government will, for the first seven months of its term, face a Senate <span class="highlight">elected</span> two years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If these proposed arrangements turn out not to be satisfactory, a future Labor government, such as the one which will be <span class="highlight">elected</span> in six weeks time, will be free to contemplate such alternative procedures and will adopt them if it believes that they will offer a better modus operandi than that being introduced at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect is to enhance these provisions in respect of certain late entrant officers who <span class="highlight">elected</span> to limit their contributions to the old DFRB scheme, with a consequential reduction in benefit expectation, but who, because of the conversion arrangements from the old to the new scheme, were placed in a disproportionately worse position visavis others transferred to the new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems perfectly logical to me that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government should determine the nature of our systems and, having done that, to hand over to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal the power to apply the statutes- not to usurp from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives the responsibility for determining the nature of the system but to apply the criteria determined by this Government as to the system we should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been one of my great sorrows that the right honourable gentle.man who was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament at the same time as myself and who made his maiden speech on the same night as I did, has refused to benefit from the continual advice I have given him about bis political views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> we had a Whip who, when the bells rang, would go out into the lobby on the Government side- we were the Government at that time- and in a stentorian voice roar down the passage: ‘Factory whistle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because people are <span class="highlight">elected</span> here to speak fearlessly, without nope of favour, without threat, we must expect the Parliament to be what it is- a live organism, an institution of which we can be proud, but which nevertheless needs some institutional reform, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to the Government that it has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to lead and if it wants to go ahead, do it, but it should show the House and the people of Australia that it understands economically what is happening around us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this period of government will be very challenging not only for this Government and the people who were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament but also for all Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament must move out into the community and make themselves available to it both individually and collectively so that it can obtain information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this connection I was amazed that  Sir John  Pagan had once again been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Board of the New South Wales Permanent Building Society Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, may I, through you, offer to  Mr Speaker  my congratulations on being <span class="highlight">elected</span> to that very important position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, had an Australian Labor Party government been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office those industries could have said goodbye to their futures and those many, many thousands of employees who have been actively involved in the manufacturing industry with their employers for a number of years would no longer be employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the sad situation is that just as there was under the Labor Government there is under this Government a section within the Department of Foreign Affairs which has had an enormous influence on foreign policy in connection with the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, and it is about time <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments started to run their foreign policy instead of allowing the bureaucrats to have so much influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament I sat on the other side of the chamber behind a Prime Minister and a Ministry which had a passionate commitment to solving many of the problems which faced and I regret to say still face this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975 after forcing an election with tactics which destroyed effectively, perhaps for all time, the convention that a government that continues to have a majority in the lower House has a right to expect to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To the people of Franklin who worked so tirelessly to have me re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> I extend my thanks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say to the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> members that I have certainly received plenty of advice; some I have heeded and some I have not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that with drive and enthusiasm from all the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> politicians in this House and from some of the older politicians who perhaps have lost a little of their drive and enthusiasm we can start to work together again to overcome these massive problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I generally believe that if a government is <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Lots of things were State responsibilities before the Whitlam Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, but between 1972 and 1975 and afterwards it clearly emerged that a lot of things that we believed were the problems of the States were areas in which the Commonwealth became involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament is a weak and weakening institution; that the Executive Government is the principal beneficiary of the Parliament’s decline; and that the Judiciary is tending to compete with the Executive Government in exploiting the Parliament’s weakness but it is having its own independence undermined through the initiatives of the Executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the State from which I come- I think my colleagues will back me up- there is a feeling that honourable members who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Federal Parliament are perhaps being demoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has given me much pleasure to know that the Government, which gave this firm undertaking before it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with such a huge majority, will now carry out its promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They regarded it as quite improper that the lawfully <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the country, which is situated in this House and not in the Senate, was being thwarted in its legitimate expectations of passing the Budget, of obtaining further Supply, to administer the affairs of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We mean the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government having the final say as to what the targets should be, fully aware that unless there has been some consensus, say through an economic advisory council, in the advice given to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, the Federal Government would have little likelihood of achieving those targets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insufficient guidelines have been set down by the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government for that institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has not been the fault of the IAC or the old Tariff Board; it has been the fault of <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments not grasping nettles such as the one I indicated earlier and not indicating the answers to the hard questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I still believe that it should be the government of the day which sets the overall guidelines; that it should be the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government establishing what is the medium and long term economic strategy within which the IAC should work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall stating in this Parliament time and again, including when I was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> as the honourable member for Mitchell in 1961, that the day of reckoning had to come and that we could not continue, by directive from the Treasury to the Reserve Bank, to encourage the importation of capital as eventually it would mean that we would have two basic problems: Firstly the impact upon our reserves of the withdrawal of capital; and, secondly, the big increase in invisibles caused by the repatriation of profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we need to do is to have a look at the history of the Government’s economic policy and particularly its ad hockery since it was first <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With all the wisdom which flowed to you from the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> you to the office- these decisions now rest with you- the question I put to you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  is this: Can you tell me what is wrong with the people of Bendigo that they send him here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As members of this Thirty-first Parliament we in this chamber- on both sides of the Houseand our colleagues in another place, have a great responsibility to those who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> us to office to justify their confidence in us, to convince them that we as parliamentarians are conscious of their needs and are earnest in our desires to meet those needs within the framework of the overall resources of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am responsible to the government, with certain qualifications, but I am not subordinate to a politically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has reflected an approach to the use of taxpayers money which has been lacking in the recent past to a very notable extent, but which has been restored since that occasion in December 1975 when the Fraser Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with an overwhelming majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was <span class="highlight">elected</span> with that majority for many reasons, not the least of which was the fact that the people of Australia called for a whole new approach to the administration not only of government in general but also of the use of public funds in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that because the honourable member for Lyne had displayed a degree of impartiality during the previous Parliament, the Leader of the House, the honourable member for New England,  Mr Sinclair,  by the use of other members of that Party, saw that  Mr Lucock  was not re-<span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, in accepting these recommendations, if indeed it does, will in fact be seeking to deny both the people and their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in Parliament control over the activities of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To take a more recent example, there can be little doubt that successive Ulster Unionist governments in Northern Ireland <span class="highlight">elected</span> to the Stormont Parliament were <span class="highlight">elected</span> according to democratic forms and that they represented the fears, prejudices and hatreds of a majority of the Ulster Protestants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Business people who have <span class="highlight">elected</span> to move out of the metropolitan areas and to set up factories in the country have found to their annoyance and alarm when they go into the cost of running a business, as any competent firm would do, that whilst their transport costs may be less, and usually subsidised by the State government, telephone charges increase astronomically, in many cases to thousands of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party will not like my doing this, but I take it back to a document which was prepared and circulated throughout Australia in September 1975 and which had a very distinct effect on the vote in the States of Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland because it said in clear and unequivocal terms what we believed about federalism and what we would do if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the most vigorous of the States-righters, far from having an electorate of their own which is distinct from the electorate which elects honourable members to this House, are in fact <span class="highlight">elected</span> by exactly the same people, but under a much less democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe equally that if the Governor-General intends to override a law of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory he should have to get the concurrence of this Parliament or at least have his decision laid before the Parliament so that there is another opportunity for the Legislative Assembly to have its law approved through debate in the Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this is probably a wise decision in the short term, but certainly in the long term I would like to see both health and education made responsible to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives know the needs and aspirations of the people, in terms of health services and education, and they are in a better position to respond to the needs of the people rather than to have those decisions made by people in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would make quite clear to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and the people of the Northern Territory the area of reserve powers of the Commonwealth, rather than confront them with a difficult constitutional situation where in respect of every piece of legislation they have to ask whether the conferral of executive authority is wide enough to enable the Assembly to execute the legislation which it has passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia was not invited to participate in the peace discussions even though we had committed our troops to fight in Vietnam, but I would have thought that at that stage any Australian, irrespective of his political persuasions, would have said that ‘full, free and democratic elections’ meant that everybody over a certain age had the right to vote; that they would have some identity with the geographic area in which they lived; that the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives would meet in an assembly; that a constitution would be drawn up providing for elections on a set basis; and that the representatives would select the leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The strategy that guides it is the one which this Government has consistently pursued since being <span class="highlight">elected</span>: A strategy to revive the private sector and to put Australia firmly on the path to long-lasting and real growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister believes the core of his Government’s policy regarding Aboriginal advancement is summed up in the term ‘self-management’ then let him tell that to the Aborigines of Woorabinda who ask for Federal Government takeover when delegates go to Aboriginal conferences and other organisations but are too frightened even to allow their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative, a Labor senator, to go there in fear of political repercussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that it would be proper at this stage of my remarks to refer to the failure of the Minister for Primary Industry to implement his mid- 1977 promise to set up an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producers consultative group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us compare the situation when the Australian Labor Party came into office in 1972 with the situation faced in 1975 and early 1976 by the Fraser coalition Government when it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who has any doubts about the fact that we are political- and we are not apologising for thatmight care to go through  Hansard  from 1973 to 1975 and read the speeches made two or three weeks after we were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has to be recognised that the first time a real and tangible effort was made by an Australian government to achieve peace in Vietnam was after the Australian Labor Party was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the situation is no longer an internal one when members of parliament become involved in activities which fly in the face of the stated Labor Party policy on which they were <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the people of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us see what the present Government has done in regard to those three things since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not go behind the backs of <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives, particularly at sensitive times in the development of communities in the South Pacific as they move towards independence, and listen to those who, firstly, would seek to divide the nation and secondly, are clearly operating against the express wishes of the Government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet there are grass roots movements in communist countries- in Eastern Europe- in the West and in the Third World which say that this is what ought to happen, that there ought to be an <span class="highlight">elected</span> world legislature with the power to pass laws on matters in dispute between nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not trust an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government to be impartial- we do not trust our governments now to be impartial- on sensitive matters there could be a requirement for a two-thirds majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of this planet place such a high value on peace that in most cases a three-quarters majority would be obtained if the <span class="highlight">elected</span> people accurately represented the people of the planet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, if the Labor Party were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office it would have a capital gains tax but it would not tax gains from capital assets when those gains were below $200,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That policy will lead to industrial chaos in that State if Labor were to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> and it would lead to an enormous cost to the taxpayer by way of increased taxes, because the Australian Labor Party in Victoria wishes to abolish the Office of Industrial Relations Coordination (Public Employing Authorities). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard it as an undemocratic procedure that this House of Parliament, with not one woman member, with no mandate, and with no direct power in relation to abortions, should be asked to subvert the rightful duties of State governments <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the majority of voters in those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with this philosophy the proposed amendment provides for a greater control over machinery matters of government for the proposed Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly; control over a much wider number of matters of government; a reduction in the Australian Government’s powers in the Bill; the provision of social security and an industrial court for Norfolk Island; the extension of Australian taxation legislation to Norfolk Island; a Bill of Rights to be included in the Bill; and the proposed Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the fairest method to all concerned, in this instance proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chair <span class="highlight">elected</span> to give considerable indulgence to the honourable member for Adelaide who, by considerable cunning- in its proper connotation- was able throughout his speech to maintain relevance to the Bills before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should note that the two speakers from the Opposition in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand, are responsible for the economic statements of a party which still believes that one of the first obligations of a re-<span class="highlight">elected</span> Labor government will be to go about persuading the Australian people that they ought to be prepared to pay much higher taxation in order to rebuild the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that on the quite realistic assumption that the Labor Party would not be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to government at the very earliest before 1983, one of its first jobs would be to go about persuading the Australian people that much higher taxation was needed in order to pay for an expanded public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made inquiries tonight and asked what he did before he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the honourable member for Adelaide demonstrates a total misunderstanding of the situation and the interests of the people of South Australia whom he is <span class="highlight">elected</span> here to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen Press reports to the effect that the Commonwealth Committee on Southern Africa which met in London on 1 8 May will organise a delegation to put to the British Government the Committee’s view that it should not recognise the Muzorewa Government which was recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> by 64 per cent of all Rhodesians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this one proviso: I cannot accept any view from the Public Service unions which might enshrine permanent heads or First Division public servants as being above or superior to <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">elected</span> government is entitled to expect that its top public servants will cooperate in implementing policies to which it is committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no argument about the obvious right of an <span class="highlight">elected</span> government to permanent heads who will administer and not sabotage government aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 24 years or so since I was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament, it has almost always happened that nobody has been able to predict the end of the session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is important for the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives not only on the Government side but also on the Opposition side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that my constituents would expect their <span class="highlight">elected</span> representative to make some input to Budget considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, that is an unhealthy situation, particularly where the input is from the public servants and the bureaucracy and not from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second way in which one can look at a Budget is that any government move with respect to funding relates to whether the government is keeping its political promises to the people- how it is performing in terms of what it went to the people with before it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office and how it is meeting those responsibilities and promises, and the expectations of the people who <span class="highlight">elected</span> it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have here an article written by  Dr Richard  Taylor in January 1979 headed ‘Labor Health Policy: ‘How Can Labor Reform the Health Care System when <span class="highlight">Elected</span> in the 1980s?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member sitting opposite has a tremendous responsibility not only to his Party but also to the Australian people to let us know just what Australian Labor Party policy is and just what the Labor Party would do in regard to bulk billing if it were <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is that this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office on the basis that it would reduce taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable members to remember when the Labor Party was struggling to implement its program, which in 1972- it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why I was <span class="highlight">elected</span>, and it is one of the objectives I had when I was <span class="highlight">elected</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He can nod his head, he can weave and twist, but the fact is that he was <span class="highlight">elected</span> and became part of a government on the pledge of his leader and on the pledge of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  to maintain Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this House denounces and condemns the Leader of the Opposition for his gross deception and fraudulence in endeavouring to pass himself off as a supporter of lower taxation, notwithstanding his atrocious record as Treasurer and his recent public threats exposed at the National Press Club on15 March this year that if <span class="highlight">elected</span> to power, he would impose additional and iniquitous taxes on the people of Australia, including, a capital gains tax, resource rental tax, and a restructuring of personal income tax involving marginal rates, conservatively assessed as being as high as eighty cents in the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on the promise that it would be able to deal with the unions in a proper way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> on that basis in December 1975 but in the following January it went into the Arbitration Commission and opposed indexation, and it has opposed it ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making my contribution to this debate, let me say at the outset that this Government was <span class="highlight">elected</span> at the end of 1975 on the promise of bringing back responsibility to economic management, of bringing a sick Australia tired of Labor excesses back to economic sanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They spoke in a thundering voice to say that they did not want a locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> legislative body to order the affairs of the national capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said they wanted to continue to be administered by the bureaucracy through the national Parliament and the Executive arm of the national Parliament with advice from a locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> advisory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives and advisory body are to assist the Minister for the Capital Territory to administer this city of some 220,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is proper at this stage of my remarks to refer to the failure of the Minister to implement the promise he made in 1977 to set up an <span class="highlight">elected</span> producers consultative group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people were nominated by various producer groups and a firm commitment was given at that time for an <span class="highlight">elected</span> body to be introduced at the earliest possible time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Capital Territory Poker Machine Control (Amendment) Ordinance 1979 has the effect of removing control over the expenditure of domestic Australian Capital Territory revenues from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of Canberra to the Minister for the Capital Territory by specific Australian Capital Territory taxes on the people and incorporated bodies of the territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Territory’s Legislative Assembly, composed of 1 8 <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives from the two Federal electorates, decided which community organisations and which projects were to receive the revenue derived from the operations of poker machines, and honourable members ought to think about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eighteen <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives from the local community deliberated upon and decided how the $lm per annum generated by the use of poker machines in the clubs would be expended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the people of the Territory told the Minister that in their opinion the present arrangements for the distribution of poker machine revenue ought to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was arrogant because the Minister did not attempt to enter into any meaningful discussion with the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should answer the questions that have been raised and tell the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives in the Assembly why he disregarded their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Association is particularly concerned that the effect of the Amendment to the Ordinance would be to remove from the ACT <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives the prerogative for the disbursement of poker machine revenue derived solely from within the ACT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very patronisingly he asks the opinion of the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives of the Australian Capital Territory at Assembly level and then immediately makes up his own mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far is I am concerned it is obligatory upon him to take into account the express views of those <span class="highlight">elected</span> to give a voice to the people of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has a responsibility to the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important issue here is this: Do we have any confidence in the representative system of government or do we have confidence only in the representative system of government when the members are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are exchanging the advice of the members of his Department- people of great competence who sometimes needed correcting during their role of advisers to a previous Minister- for the views of the locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister has chosen to disregard completely in this instance the advice of the locally <span class="highlight">elected</span> people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The funds are generated locally and people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> locally ought to be charged with the responsibility for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the last four years or so we have had a Legislative Assembly composed of 18 <span class="highlight">elected</span> people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view the election should have taken place three years after the representatives were first <span class="highlight">elected</span> as was originally conceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the very heart of the nation, in the place from which many of the decisions of government flow, we do not entrust the <span class="highlight">elected</span> representatives with this task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems almost indecent at this stage of the debate to remind the House that every Government member was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in 1975 on a promise made on their behalf by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to ‘maintain and improve Medibank ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What he is saying is that he completely disregards an undertaking which a nationally <span class="highlight">elected</span> government has entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- I am very pleased to announce that the newly <span class="highlight">elected</span> Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher, M.P., has accepted an invitation to visit Australia and will be here on 30 June and 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1977-78 exchange losses on loans were $15,831,000, and that was the reason why TAA <span class="highlight">elected</span> to use its own reserves to purchase its 727-200 series aircraft late last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Act now requires one member of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority to be a member of the Legislative Assembly who has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> by the Legislative Assembly as its representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this is not to be attained at the cost of removing the principle of accountability to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Salisbury  took the view that he was not responsible to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Government but to a vague notion, as I have indicated before, which he called the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What appears to be the traditional British view on the relationship between Government and the police, of total independence from the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government, is rejected in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather to reinforce the view that the police are accountable to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day, and not to some vague notion, as I have indicated before, of a higher authority called the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I am concerned that we should ensure that there are adequate safeguards, guidelines, parameters within which that force can operate- parameters that are not to limit it in the discharge of its duties, but parameters that are to limit its capacity, the capacity of any individual member of the force, the capacity of its Commissioner, the capacity of its ministerial head, to abuse the powers in a way which could erode the authority of a democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament and destroy the possibility of that Parliament being democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> again in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To determine whether early retirement affects longevity it would be necessary to compare survival from say age 60 in a group who continued to work after that age with survival from age 60 in a group of similar health at that age and who <span class="highlight">elected</span> to retire then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-117-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my view that if someone has been <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent the people of the community it is not appropriate for anybody to apply any restrictions to his capacity to carry out his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point to the Parliament that in the present situation of representative government I do not think that it is appropriate for there to be any restrictions upon the age or anything else of people who are <span class="highlight">elected</span> as representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One way of course is to retain the idea that members of the House of Assembly should represent the communitybecause they are <span class="highlight">elected</span> by popular vote- on various organisations, committees and statutory bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this for two, as I understand it, powerful reasons, firstly because the terms of settlement it envisages are essentially right in themselves in that they are based on the principles that the people of Zimbabwe- all the people- have the right to choose who shall govern them, and that the government so <span class="highlight">elected</span> should have real control over the affairs of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though one might see some half truth in that, the implications for the political system under which we are <span class="highlight">elected</span> to represent the people- that is to say, the democratic system- are very alarming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the position of families is concerned, this Government has a record since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> in December 1975, through its Budgets and its other economic decisions, of giving support to the family which is the envy of other political parties in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is exemplified by the Weimar phenomenon, or, in South Australia, the Salisbury phenomenon where the secret service believes it has a loyalty to some higher concept- to the state, to the Crown, or in the case of ASIO, to the Central Intelligence Agency; it has some loyalty over and above, higher and more important than its loyalty or responsibility to the <span class="highlight">elected</span> executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of these situations which I have just mentioned- the Weimar, Salisbury and the ASIO responsibility to the CIA- deny the responsibility of the intelligence agency to the democratically <span class="highlight">elected</span> government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of ASIO is that it has a special God-given, rather than statute-given, right which places it above public scrutiny, able to act on its own conception of public duty, secure in its secrecy and able to do things that are denied the <span class="highlight">elected</span> Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just in case the Opposition should think that the Government is using a heavy hand in bringing about this limitation of debate on these Bills, let me just compare the experience of the Parliament under the present Government since it was <span class="highlight">elected</span> to office late in 1975 and the experience when  Mr Fred  Daly was Leader of the House between autumn of 1973 and the Budget of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was on 22 November 1958 that we were first <span class="highlight">elected</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (3) No recent representations have been made or discussions held on the terms of development of the Aurukun bauxite deposit However, on IS November 1979 I met briefly with the Project Officer of Aurukun Associates who outlined his organisation ‘s discussions with the Aurukun Aboriginal community and the more recently <span class="highlight">elected</span> Aurukun Shire Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-140">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Has any approach been made to the Attorney-General to grant a waiver of parliamentary privilege to allow the  Deputy  Prime Minister to give evidence to the investigation proceeding in Tasmania, alleging conspiracy to bring down a lawfully <span class="highlight">elected</span> State Government by the offering of bribes - alleged to have come from major gambling interests - to the then  Deputy  Premier,  Mr Lyons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are members to be <span class="highlight">elected</span> to this chamber on the basis of the wide open spaces or the grains of sand in their electorates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What they were doing was usurping the authority of <span class="highlight">elected</span> governments in deciding policy issues which really bore no relevance to their own industrial affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill allows former members of the New South Wales teaching service who were teaching in Australian Capital Territory technical institutions in 1976 and who <span class="highlight">elected</span> to join the Commonwealth Teaching Service after 3 1 December 1976 and before 1 April 1977 to preserve their long service leave conditions that applied under State legislation in force immediately prior to their joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service and to treat future teaching service as if it were State service for the purposes of that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>The 12 witless men now seem to be replaced by the blustering bravado of the 17 members of the ACTU executive who apparently will lead the ALP into any future political posture they may wish to take with respect to uranium without the <span class="highlight">elected</span> members of the Parliamentary Labor Party having much say or opportunity to condone it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></li>
