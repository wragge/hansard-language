<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I object to the doctrine that law and order must be obeyed according to the book and according to the letter, and that this is the only test of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, because all too often it is the very means by which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is destroyed and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is prevented from emerging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole history of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is one of disobedience to law - of disobedience to unjust law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make the point that to be an effective <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to have reasonable people in Parliament, to have an informed public knowing what it is voting for, is partly connected with the Parliamentary Allowances Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phrases such as ‘participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ are being used in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the time allotted for the debate has almost expired I do not have much of a chance to enter into the discussion except to say that I am totally opposed to this Bill because it destroys all principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not my idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and decency there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them are obviously closely associated with public disorder and are publicly associated with deriding this Parliament and, therefore, deriding the very instrument by which the policies of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are carried into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then formed a very real impression of the commitment he has to Parliament as an institution serving the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and I look forward to the continuance in his position as  Chairman  of Committees of the same instinct he showed on the Standing Orders Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a Party is a few numbers short, what can it do with an arrogant, overbearing Government which is perpetuating at this moment what we might term the rape of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> has been raped in this Parliament today by the honourable gentleman and those who sit behind him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said about the cost of elections and it is significant that the cost of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> cannot be estimated in terms of dollars and cents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to perfect <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but the point is that fairness does not exist in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I do not want to take up too much time of the House by referring to procedures in the House but I think that the protection of the rights of private members is fundamental to the operation of this House and therefore fundamental to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The right honourable member is obviously referring to a speech entitled’Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Democratic’ delivered by the present Minister for Labor and Immigration on 1 7 September 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, we are witnessing the demise of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he implied that I was embarrassed because the Opposition speakers exposed the conduct of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  I was grossly misrepresented, but if he meant that I was embarrassed at the depths to which parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> descended in this House last Thursday at the hands of the Prime Minister he was correct, and I was not misrepresented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Would it not help the position in East Timor and alleviate the fears of Indonesia if Portugal itself became a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made to the question of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being determined outside the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot sit here in isolation and consider that whatever they determine may be the interpretation given by the population to the term ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to talk about the way this Government has brutalised the great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of this chamber - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to work with the people to create an Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> here is dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was their cry, as though the fact that the people of Australia gave the Australian Labor Party a vote of less than 50 per cent represents a defeat of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin by saying that the Australian Labor Party’s platform provides for participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in union affairs and provides that no financial union member shall be deprived of the right to vote in the election of union committees exercising any powers of management and that no committee man shall be permitted to occupy a full time office unless he is elected by a direct secret vote of the rank and file of his union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear and dangerous threat to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, law and order posed by public statements inciting mass action outside the parliamentary process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has come out to say to them that no longer must their perversion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, their corruption of youth - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would do better to heed the words of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean),  a man who knows something about the workings of this Parliament and a man who has some regard for its traditions and for the traditions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They all stood for the suppression of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and they will stand forever condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the present Prime Minister cannot recognise that something very squalid has taken place- if he remains impervious to the decencies and niceties of constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> then we are in for a very rough time indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not appreciate a speech made in this House, which stands for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, one that obviously has been prepared in the office of an embassy in Canberra, by a foreign power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will we learn that it serves our interests better to promote the development of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the ultimate of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, much as I would like to tell you about the discriminating electors of Denison or to speak of matters attracting wide consensus such as parliamentary salaries, I intend rather to consider a subject without which the Governor-General’s Speech would have had very little meaning -<span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likely,  Sir, that  never before has <span class="highlight">democracy</span> been subjected to such widespread criticism as has been the case since the end of World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, by its very freedom, contains the potential for its own subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great weaknesses of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country has been the absence of consistent constructive criticism from within the political arena but outside the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what, you may ask,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  has this to do with <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> can flourish only in an atmosphere of trust, out of an inclination to recognise the truth, and with an intent to protect those who expose the truth however hard the establishments and the vested interests are knocked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Herein lies another major problem of latter day <span class="highlight">democracy</span>: How, with universal franchise, to disseminate information at adequate levels of detail? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may put the point more succinctly, whether or not politics is the science of exigencies or the art of the possible, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is surely the art of compromise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do mean is that, in the main, they should stop complaining and start participating, for, as I see it, participation is the keystone of a healthy <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reasons are numerous: deference, embarrassment, apathy among our more passive citizens; among the would be activists impatience couples with adherence to the principle of least effort in finding that the machinery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> grinds slowly to produce a coarser flour than suits the purist’s palate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, they need not be exposed, but merely to think they are, to constitute a significant imperfection in the fabric of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the many definitions and interpretations of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I find its qualities best expressed in the phrase ‘equality of opportunity’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we reach a stage where that proportion of the population which is capable of developing trained and critical minds should subordinate the sharpening of its intellectual skills to the doctrine of togetherness, then I concur with Professor Monro that it becomes ‘at least arguable that de Tocqueville was right, and that we are paying a very heavy price indeed for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  the will to develop all the innate skills of our people is the hallmark of a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that, despite its imperfections, this <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is sufficiently liberal for him to move from that position if he has the innate capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must guard the self respect of its citizens and ensure that no one worth his salt goes to the wall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more mundane requirement of effective <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than allegiance to principle or to party is, 1 believe, the need for accuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> can be defined as something unobtainable without Hare-Clark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a crisis today in industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it stems, as  Sir Isaiah  Berlin suggested in a rare interview, from:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it should be a matter of saying: ‘What can I do and how can I help’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen some great, honest and courageous men in this place, but I feel that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will work and continue only as long as there are people who are prepared to query occasionally a decision of the Executive and stand up in this House and say: ‘I represent the people, not just a party or a power combine.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that 1 listened with interest to the honourable member for Denison  (Dr Solomon)  in his analysis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the need for participation and training in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what way do we educate the young for participation in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labour Party was founded by men who strove for the wider horizons of education, the principle of loyalty to their fellow workers and their community, the need for associations to achieve these purposes and concepts of justice and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for every individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the story there runs the foresight of some, the conservatism of others, the attitudes of the capitalists of the day who had reached the height of their power and the slow gropings of the developing Labor movement which was then achieving the militancy and unity it needed for nationalism and its concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States constitution was forged on the anvil of a war of independence and it was hammered into shape by new concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their Constitution was framed at a time when they were fighting a war of independence; framed at a time when they were beginning a new concept in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time I would certainly argue that the dissenting young are necessary to any healthy <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and they perform a service to society by pointing out evil and injustice without necessarily offering alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aura of silence that permeates this institution, the evasive statements made to the House by Ministers and the talk-a-lot say-nothing answers given to questions are not conducive to public participation in the fundamental of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and that is informed public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague from Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  for instance, has often been noted and quoted as having a very high regard for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, for the rights of private members and for the necessity for us to remove from the Executive some of its transcendental authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under its baleful influence, the conflict in Vietnam escalated into the longest and third largest war this century; it has been at the root of the massive blunders and massive bloodshed of this conflict; it has built up a tawdry totalitarian regime, running a fifthrate power, as the arbiter of Indo-China, while a hardly less totalitarian regime drags in its wake the prestige of the mightiest <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the world has known or will ever know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the bottom of the alienation of so many and so much representing the best in our communities is the failure to answer this crucial question of our time: Why is our cause, the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - embracing mankind’s hope for decency and dignity, backed as it is by unparalleled power - so vulnerable, and in this region so apparently impotent, in the face of the challenge of so obsolete, crude and brutal a creed as Communism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not a role which this or any other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should set for itself - or believe itself capable of achieving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more important than this is the action which was taken by the Opposition last night, because I think that action strikes at the very roots of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and such action has never been seen in this Parliament before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not in the nature of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we all like the laws that exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we respect the laws and that we follow nothing but constitutional procedures in our attempts to alter our laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and that is the policy of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the man who has just spoken wants in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This motion has been moved against the Leader of the Labor Party in an endeavour to distract public attention from the people who are struggling along in Government and completely betraying all the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 say as a fact that this Party here and in another place will fight tooth and nail for the restoration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But above all else in this Parliament we will fight for a restoration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> against the type of leadership that the Leader of the House gives to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Irrespective of what the Press might say, what the Country Party might say and what members on the other side of the House might say, we will restore <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns me more than anything else is that if what went on last night, which the Leader of the Opposition claims to have organised, is to be the standard in the Parliament in future this Parliament and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not saying <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is perfect in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is slow; it is cumbersome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As one of those members who stood in his place here this morning in protest against the actions that were taking place here - actions by  Mr Speaker  and by the Government - I say that I would do it again with other honourable members on this side because we are determined that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be returned to this place so that honourable members will have the opportunity to bring business before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regret that we had to take the action which was taken, but we had to bring to the attention not only of the Government but also of the people of the country the way in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being suppressed in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, any attempt to change the law should be made within the framework of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet in all these years of America’s agony at home and abroad, despite the near disruption of her society, despite demonstrations by the scores, despite the demoralisation of the world’s oldest and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’s largest organised political party, the Democratic Party of the United States, no responsible leader or organ has ever effectively charged that Communists were behind the dissenters or even significantly among them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thing which distinguishes the Gorton Government from all others, the thing which distinguishes the Australian Liberal Party from every significant party in every other significant <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world, is mis: This Liberal Party alone has tried consciously, consistently, as an act of deliberate policy, to indict half the nation for treason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has never been true for any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this that is the real threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and our system in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The answer to this question requires an understanding of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people seem to think that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is just Parliament alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the manifestations of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and it can become a most important manifestation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if people are prepared to come out of their apathy and do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is government by the people, and government by the people demands action by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communists can be a threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but threats to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia come from a different direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> begins on the farms, in the factories and in the streets, and if people will not, often at risk to themselves, stand up for their rights in those places there will be no <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, unless there is a change there will be difficulties in the future in the development and extension of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, because <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is government by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the most savage challenge which faces <span class="highlight">democracy</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is Australia an electoral <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, because in the late hours of a night not so very long ago we passed through this Parliament amendments to the Electoral Act to ensure that the seat of Malley should have 45.000 voters and the seat of Wills should have 58,000 and also that around Australia there would be some people whose vote would count for 4 and others for 3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have negated <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the way <span class="highlight">democracy</span> works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue becomes one that is intensely a matter of our own personal beliefs in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seeks, moreover, to foster a healthy property-owning <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of sturdy independent individuals and regards home ownership as a basic ingredient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very long tradition of support, extending back in our own British history for nearly 1,000 years, for the belief that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is what happens in Parliament and also what happens outside Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> depends upon the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this shows a lack of respect for the people in the action of forming a will without which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> cannot work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this man talks about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, what does he mean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me and, I think, to the majority of people, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> means that when a fair and just election has been held - in which the people have been able to vote freely - and the result has been obtained, the Government is allowed to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Communists believe they should get into a country and use all the freedoms of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - free speech, free gathering, free association and no censorship - to obtain their ends until the country is brought to its knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they did that, I would be more impressed than I am by their ravings and by their moralising which, to me, will not bring about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as I understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I look at this Parliament and I too, as well as the honourable member for Lalor, wonder how long <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will last in this country and in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall a speech made by Lord Morrison, a distinguished former Minister of the British Labour Party, who said that if the Labour Party allowed the Communists to join its ranks, did not oppose them and instead collaborated with them and if members of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom were associated with and supported the Communist Party that would be the day when <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would finish because from there on there would be a forum in Parliament for the views of those who wished to end the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Lalor suggested that this was an example of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 hope that as a result of his having moved this amendment the Australian electorate will appreciate that the alternative government has altered its very nature - its approach to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Acts brought down by successive South African governments - Acts that were introduced under the cloak of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - are such that they violate almost every single article of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have made a mockery of the word <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ for they have created a society where 3 million white people have unprecedented power over the rights and freedom of 16 million black and coloured people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bantustan system of internal selfgovernment for Africans makes a mockery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and is a distortion of history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All elements of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> have ben abandoned and all liberal theories and principles - as, for example, the liberal reforms that were attempted in Czechoslovakia - have been abandoned and there is a rigid repression of any kind of liberal thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no longer possible to depict or defend this war in terms of the freedom of the Vietnamese people or the people of Indo-China, a war for freedom or for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, a war against China or a war to maintain the American alliance, or any of the other definitions which have been used to extenuate and extend our commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think I should read parts of it to the House to show what type of honourable member it is who has just attacked members of the Labor Party, people who fight for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, prominent church men, editors of Catholic newspapers and others as being Communists and supporters of a fifth column in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge him to stand in this Parliament, introduce that legislation and show whether he believes in what he said and whether he is a full supporter of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or a straight out supporter of Fascist causes and all they stand for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the kind of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which this Government and the American Government are supporting in their genocidal activities in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attitude makes <span class="highlight">democracy</span> sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unhappily, today, in the Australian Labor Party, there are increasing signs of the fundamental Marx-Leninist objective; the destruction of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but I must close by stating that I believe the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign is an imported tactic designed to violate the processes of Parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by the use of sectional pressures of disruption and threats of force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect he is saying that Australia has been so remiss and ineffectual in fulfilling its clear obligations to prepare and educate the people of New Guinea for political independence that even the basic concept of Government and Opposition in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not understood there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The compilation, the structure, the building up of this Bill represent one of the greatest expositions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have witnessed for many a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely contradictory to the whole tradition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the law making procedure upon which the democratic process is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the instigation of this Government, we have gone 7,000 miles across the sea, far beyond our bona fine interests, not to uphold the flame of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but the extinguish it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that we are there to promote <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but apparently we are willing to get out and leave the country in a undemocratic state in terms of the Government’s attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely this is essential in any state even approaching <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I do believe that, either because of the existence of large pressure groups or possibly of a public relations exercise insisted on by the United States of America, there do exist some symptoms, some signs of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> in Australia was in danger because a few thousand people were going to march the following day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the Government supporters had to wear badges depicting Australian flags to show that they were patriots ready to defend <span class="highlight">democracy</span> against this imminent threat of Red invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> everywhere is a fairly fragile institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extraordinarily aggressive nature of man ensures that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is  a  somewhat fragile affair, even if it does not appear fragile to us living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by appealing to those Government supporters who value <span class="highlight">democracy</span> not to be trapped again into exhibitions of mass hysteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the powers of a Prime Minister of this nation, the person who holds that position has never possessed the right, nor will he ever possess the right in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as ours, to break and dishonour undertakings given or made for him or for his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At no stage did I ever see him give any impression that he was concerned in any way with what I would call the real values of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or with anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that those honourable members opposite who wish this House to continue as a House of Parliament operating in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a democratic way should take note of what is contained in the first portions of the 2 amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not reverse your ruling and if the House does not carry the dissent motion, I can only suggest that politics have overridden <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lies in lifting the veil of secrecy surrounding the workings of government, and it lies in community participation in decision making - what we call participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the basic rights in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the people’s right to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that for the sake of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is urgent that what one might call the contradiction between the 2 sides of the Press - the freedom to print and the freedom of the individual - be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to neglect the huge number of members in the Parliament who are dependent entirely on their own resources to carry out their duties is not, I think, an example of doing the best for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said previously in this House, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a fairly fragile institution everywhere and generally its supporters should not attack it falsely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To some extent parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will depend on attracting reasonable and able people with at least some sense of public service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that we are not a true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> unless all political parties can get their view to the market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> as well as the Parliament and the people are not well served if the member of Parliament feels that his sole responsibility is h s electorate; if he feels that he has no responsibility for what is happening in the rest of Australia; or if he feels that all he need do is attend charity bazaars and naturalisation ceremonies and kiss a baby or two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no future for a non-party system in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and it would be a vast mistake if we thought that introducing a committee type of arrangement could do away with the confrontation of political parties with different philosophies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate my condemnation of and utter disgust for the action of those people who so frequently pretend that they are the protectors of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when in fact they do not even know the meaning of the word, let alone know what principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should be  applied in a place like this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic philosophical issue for our democratic society is that there are rights for minorities, lt Ls no: a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that is run by a majority which believes that a decision made by the majority must at all times bc upheld, even whore it arises as a result of moral standards which become somewhat osified in a conservative environment because they have not been subjected to critical scrutiny as frequently and as intensively as should be desirable in a liberal society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If he does deny that - and it is the basic assumption of his Press statement - then honourable members will clearly see the degree to which the continuing story of Commonwealth-State conflict under 7 Liberal  Treasurers over the last 2 years has damaged the basis of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a wealth of things to discuss in the field of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - new concepts in race relations, Commonwealth and world security and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could have been told that he has several more honourable members - and notably new members - on h!s side of the House who have been independently involved in trying to evolve a system such as this which will increase the efficiency of the operation of this place and thereby, some of us think, the workings of the Parliament and perhaps even the furthering of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in at least one of its manifestations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have we solicitude for honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for the Northern Territory, but we would like to see <span class="highlight">democracy</span> maintained and a vote taken on this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential, in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and upholding the role of this House, that the motion moved by the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  be supported by all honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact he has it in his heart to see that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope tonight that  Mr Medlyn,  although he is suffering greatly from his disabilities, at least takes some satisfaction from the fact that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has been served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why this is such a clear attempt to strike at the very basic roots of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> faces a very important challenge at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is necessary at this stage for a country such as Australia to establish standards for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which other people can admire and emulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area in which we live parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - indeed the whole idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - is under continual challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These days people talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but they implement it as little as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last world war in conditions which were never so difficult inside the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom decided that it was right to suspend a principal pillar of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; that because elections would be too divisive there would be no elections until the war was over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pillar of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was suspended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the free world demands that South Vietnam, without long experience of democratic government behind it as there was in the case of the United Kingdom, establish a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government and no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is perfect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly the policy of the Australian Labor Party today in respect of affairs at home to swing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> from accepting the rule of the people through elections and the rule of the Parliament through laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there are moves, desperate efforts, to embarrass the Government and to give effect to the urgent ambition of some who, for the passing advantage of destroying a Government and changing sides in this House, are willing to pay the price of sacrificing all respect for Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there is no place at all for political interference or for the establishment of guidelines either for television stations or for any other sector of the mass media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is never successful in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They demand the right to accept all the privileges and benefits of living in a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> without contributing anything at all to that freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: There is no room in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for political interference in any shape or form with the mass media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, while I share this want of confidence in the Opposition, I realise too that the trend is dangerous for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the rule of law in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever this is done certain people see a sinister motive and a disintegration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when all that is happening is the preservation of the age old right of peaceful assembly in the ancient tradition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very thankful for this, but <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should not hinge on an invitation by those who control our public media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere fact that we can lose <span class="highlight">democracy</span> not because we are standing for these things and being firm against those protecters but because we are allowing them to take control should be of concern to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The searchers for genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are sitting on the benches of this national Parliament and they do not stand alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wonder whether parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a myth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, thirdly, we have the attempt of the honourable member for Evans  (Dr Mackay)  at guided <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of that it resorts to these other things as an alternative government prepared to ignore centuries of tradition, to ignore the interests of the public servants whose duty it is to carry out the law, to frustrate them and to frustrate the processes of government, and then say that this is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we ought to defend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is entirely wrong that responsible, elected bodies charged with preserving <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should take steps which are designed clearly to intimidate and to prevent the expression of those rights within the community! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They owe no allegiance to capitalism, to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to Socialism or to Communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also means the preservation of the opportunity for the expression of ideas; it means the preservation of the opportunity to express dissent, and to express it in a peaceful way; it means something of the British traditions that we have inherited, such as the preservation of the rule of law and of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and not mobocracy; it means an appreciation that maturity in the individual means the recognition of the right of another to have and to express a point of view that is different from one’s own; and it means the preservation of the British parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked whether we wanted <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or mobocracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demonstration was a forceful reply to those MPs who described intending marchers as ‘bikies who are pack raping <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 120 or so governments in the world that have attempted parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> how many are still flourishing in full flight as parliamentary democracies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will be rejected and that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will reign once more, so that the Opposition can give full expression to the views of more than half the people and nol be curtailed by the guil’otine <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to draw attention to the fact that if we followed the example of the Labor Party there would be no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> here at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our form of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, with all its faults and with all the room there is for improvements, is the best system devised so far for ruling a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not allow one person who is here today and gone tomorrow - that applies to us all - to determine the site for what will be the most magnificent building in this city - the building, more than any other building, which will symbolise our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and our system of parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To serve one’s fellow countrymen in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should be the highest calling of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to operate the Parliament of the Commonwealth must consist of men from all walks of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We won <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by breaking laws, by demonstrating in the streets, by cutting off the heads of kings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that a good deal of what  Dr Cairns  is reported to have said was part of the campaign to achieve <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but we have achieved <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a real threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country in a continuation of this determined effort to inspire people to break the laws or to defy the laws and to terminate all respect for authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the alternative to a working <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot about hijacking recently and I say that this attempt to take the law of the land out of the hands of Parliament and into the hands of the mobs in the streets is the greatest hijacking of all; it is the hijacking of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After it that Government said: ‘<span class="highlight">Democracy</span> and democratic parliamentary government are now established in South Vietnam’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And long live <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as long as we can have this sort of dissent from the sort of thing that is going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole approach to this involvement has been a military one, an economic one - not one of defending <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or human principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was asking for evidence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not accept the word ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ at its face value just because some friendly government says it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because a government is against Communism does not mean that it knows what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are so interpreted in practice as to result in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in North Vietnam they are so interpreted as to result in the negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not discussing the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of a Communist Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refuses to listen to the criteria of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 149 and to my rational, sane request for a rational, sane description of how a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> works, how one asseses it and how one finds out whether it is more democratic or less democratic than a Communist regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we are fighting for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it not extraordinary that we hear so much about whether South Vietnam is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but nothing about whether North Vietnam is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extraordinary thing about the honourable member for Capricornia was that he said it is not our place to decide whether they have a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or a dictatorship there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in Vietnam for a very specific and clear purpose, and that is to give these people the right to determine their own future by democratic vote according to Asian ideas of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> really means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I think that that country is moving further along the road to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than it was 4 or 5 years ago, nobody can claim that it is the kind of government we would support totally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not there is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Vietnam - which the honourable member for Capricornia says he does not believe in anyway - is a matter of doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The magical thing, when one stops to consider the situation, is that a country at war can go so far along the path towards <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, lt is insufferable to hear the bookworm geniuses who from time to time stand up and criticise South Vietnam, a nation at war, a nation which is facing tremendous problems, over its progress towards <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot wish for much better from South Vietnam, a country in a state of war and tremendous troubles, than the great progress made towards <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in its society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other point that the honourable member for Angas brought up - and this is something that worries me very much - is that we can look at the system of elections in South Vietnam and say that this is genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course the honourable member for Angas let himself out very nicely by saying: ‘After all, South Vietnam is at war; you cannot expect a nation at war to have a real <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what do we mean by the term ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span> ‘? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Angas said that all that is necessary is to have 7 elections, that 90 per cent of the people will turn up and this means <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is a start on the road to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that almost all of these exercises in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Vietnam have been aimed specifically at one objective, and that is to legitimise the authority of those who have been in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideally in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> information concerning the activities of Government and policy decisions should be open to all so that the people can know the changing nature of their rights and privileges as decided by their elected representatives, so that an informed and adequate public debate can take place on policy issues and so that checks and balances are available on the activities of governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the great majority of cases, open and fair reporting leads to a more informed public opinion from which our representative democratic government system can function better, lt is an important element of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that a continuing striving for improvement in communication exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The abandonment, as indicated by the Minister, of the principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the individual is superior to the state and that the state is the servant of the individual is the precursor of totalitarianism, the master state, either Communist or Fascist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will dive into recess taking with it, it hopes, the report of the Australian National Line before we get a chance to discuss it properly and taking with it all the other things on the notice paper, and we, the representatives of the great <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, will slide into the limbo with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we pretend that we are educating people to live in that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but we use anything but democratic procedures in order to arrange or run our educational processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With members of the community holding such valid and diverse opinions it is obvious the Minister will never please everybody, and I suppose that is one of the things we must expect in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If 55 per cent of the people in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ask for something or suggest that a certain method should be used, that request or suggestion should be observed by the Government, even though the proportion expressing that view is smaller than had previously applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way in which we can ultimately guarantee that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will work is to have a sufficient number of people in this House who will give up their time to delve into these things and who will watch carefully what goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things most undermining faith in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country is the growing feeling that the electoral processes cannot change anything - that the people’s aspirations cannot be met by those processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be big enough in our government and mature enough in our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have reached the stage where, if it is not possible to afford expensive but needed services in the community without increasing taxes, we can confidently explain why it is necessary to raise taxes, why taxes or some other form of income raising will have to be accepted so that we can institute these services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, speaking in the Parliament on 20th April 1961 the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  said:   the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides the fabric of Australia’s <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing is more vital to the working of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than the mechanism by which the parliament is elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> demands that electorates should have as nearly as possible the same population and equality of voting power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had first past the post voting been in force in the Commonwealth sphere in  1961  <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would have been served by the election of a Labor government with a majority of  8  instead of a minority of one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No wonder the Country Party wants preferential voting, lt is the complete negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When talking of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is a fundamental concept that the basis of elections should be clear and fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought it was very appropriate that he closed with a quotation from Abraham Lincoln who is regarded as one of the principal exponents of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might refer to that,  Mr Speaker,  as Country Party <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this accords with the definition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> put forward by the Minister on behalf of his Government it is a little different from the kind of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> espoused by the honourable member for Grayndler when he was quoting the words of Abraham Lincoln. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of discussing the social welfare aims appropriate in an affluent <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and instead of discussing need, all of us too often have been content to deal in statistics, averages, percentages, tables, indices and summaries and having exhausted all these things, in reciprocal abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government then says that anything left after that, to a perhaps non-political person or a person who attaches little importance to these rights, is left over for the person who wants to persuade people that his point of view is right and who wants to exercise his full rights in a modern <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that honourable members will think as though they arc Australians - not Labor Party supporters, Liberal Party supporters or anything else - and remember that this is just one step closer to the demise of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Parliament in its foolishness decides to allow this man this further rope with which to hang <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia, I hope that as a last bastion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> you,  Mr Speaker,  the senior member and officer of the Parliament, will stand up and say, as your predecessor Archie Cameron stood up and said: ‘You will go no further in this matter.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be foolish to suggest that there is any other meaning in  Mr Polites’  remarks than that he, his Australian Council of Employer Federations and the people whom they represent, are in fact demanding of the Government that if any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists in this country it should be replaced by complete dictatorship, in the hands of the Liberal Party and the Australian Council of Employer Federations in order to halt the progress which unions are making in obtaining a fairer share of profits from increased production brought about by the efforts of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that freedom of the Press is a fundamental principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in addition, I know that journalists have to earn a living and that sometimes their reports are exaggerated or misleading in their endeavours to get a story across, but I believe that this House could never condone a deliberate untruth in a matter of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extremely important to remember that there are many people who are basically the most democratic people in our society, who are more concerned about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than almost anybody else, who do more for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to continue to exist in our society, but who are being turned off by our sort of society and by the actions of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>critically important to us and that if it wants <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to succeed here it should get rid of the incubus that surrounds it compelling it to vote according to a policy determined by the biennial conferences of the Australian Labor Party and by persuasion from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the more interesting debates which took place at The Hague - from my point of view anyhow - were on the various concepts of democratic government and parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> represented at that conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be of interest to honourable members to examine the different points of view which were expressed, especially those view* on the structures and operations of Parliament which were expressed by people from countries which practise forms of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> different from ours and which have different ideological understandings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a very great issue affecting the future of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia, and unless we are prepared to grapple with it, unless we are prepared to set up some form of committee of inquiry so that this matter can be researched fully and common sense decisions arrived at, it augers very badly indeed for the future of this Parliament and it augers very badly indeed for the respect that the public has for the forms, traditions, and activities of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of things I would like to see altered in the future in this House because I believe that in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is only right that when sensible amendments are moved in this House - whether they are accepted by the Government or not - they should be fully debated and if they are accepted after such debate we should ensure that the amendments are put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one attends a meeting such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Malaysia which I recently attended, and if one takes part in a debate for example on a topic such as government and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or democratic institutions, and listens to the views of people from Africa, Asia and elsewhere as well as of those from the long established democracies of the British Commonwealth, one will come to a viewpoint fairly readily that we have here, however imperfect, a form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which many people in the world would be exceedingly happy to emulate if in fact they could manage to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While not quite approaching the capacity for selfexamination and self-criticism of the American <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - which of course provides it with both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness in terms of day to day operation, the greatest strength being the long term likelihood of survival - our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is on the same staircase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition knows - he must know in his heart - as a distinguished lawyer that to make that sort of utterance is destructive of a very basic principle upon which our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends and, therefore, it is a matter for the public at large to judge whether this is not a matter that ought to be taken into account when a judgment is being made on the future government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hoped that, because at bottom every one of us who has the privilege of sitting in this House must have a concern for the parliamentary process that transcends the squabbles of party politics and if we have a concern for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for the preservation of the rule of law, no-one in this House, party political considerations altogether apart, would want to see the Leader of the Opposition or any significant member of this Parliament - indeed, any member of this Parliament, significant or otherwise - condoning an attitude towards a valid law of this Parliament that is inimical to the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Such a condonation and such an encouragement of disobedience - those 2 things are implicit in the words of the Leader of the Opposition - are calculated only to undermine our very basic values as supporters of a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It goes to the very fountainhead upon which parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> either nourishes or founders, because if a government seeks to legislate not in keeping with the views of the electorate the electors will impose their sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>South Vietnam has had a very difficult time in the last 13 or 14 years, but it is to its credit that it has been able to carry out elections for presidents and elections for its Assembly, elections of a kind which Britain, a stable and long-established <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, did not feel able to conduct during the 1940-45 War when Britain was under much less stress than Vietnam is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that, whatever one may think of the Government or the Opposition or of political parties, it is a sad and bad day for our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when the Parliament itself is being assailed by people because the Parliament has not performed in a manner in which the people expect it to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think when we are considering the various comments that have been made by members such as the flamboyant honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  - from the waving rice land of that area telling us partly the situation and speculating about all the rest - and the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Webb)  waving the banner of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this matter, we should just look at this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, it is lopsided <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at its very worst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that in all sincerity knowing full well the suffering that the Assistant Ministers would be personally caused if their seats were declared vacant but in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, let us be on sound constitutional grounds on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We shall soon have to stand before the people and show where we stand in the great struggle that is dividing the world between <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and international communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would truly be a representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No-one could convince me that that is truly representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the kind of leadership that comes from union rules that guarantee participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s blatant opposition to a reasonable wage increase, and the methods used to achieve its end, is a disgrace to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and is condemned by the Opposition as a blatant abuse of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the honourable member for Hindmarsh not believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I made my maiden speech on the working of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and I hope I have some appreciation of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that a youth of 18 is mature enough, courageous enough and old enough to be conscripted to fight for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This being the case, on what grounds could they be declared ineligible to have a voice in maintaining <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be divorced from these assumptions and based squarely on the right of citizens of this age to take their rightful place in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and exercise all their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that under the Liberal-Country Party Government it is not justice or <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that counts at this time but rather the fear of the effect of the vote of these young people on this worn out, tired and decadent tory administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, some of the notions in this Bill come into that category - for example, the concept of court controlled appeals and the concept of increasing industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one has to bear in mind when one looks at these slogans, these expressions introduced by this kind of government, such as ‘increased <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and ‘more freedom to appeal’, a very real social purpose is being chased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said, it is easy to talk about industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but every one of us, even honourable members on the other side, must accept that amalgamations are good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No system of industrial relations yet devised by man is perfect but ours might well be described in the words used by  Sir Winston  Churchill when he spoke about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and said that it was the worst system imaginable, except for all the alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anything can defeat the purposes and intentions of this legislation, whatever they might be, it will be these huge salary increases which have been backdated several months and the establishment Qf precedents which, in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, are dangerous in the extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It strikes me that the Government and everyone else is arguing, and we are supporting, that in arbitration and conciliation there should be as much <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as possible in relation to unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone who upholds our system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, under which the Parliament passes our laws and the police, under ministerial control, see that those laws are carried out, has a vested interest because of his own security and safety to see that every support is given to the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia is still relatively small enough to be a communicating <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the Government believes in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 2 great philosophies in the world today, and these are <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is our desire to follow the democratic way of life I believe it is essential that Western democracies be united, and I include in that category Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and those European and Asian countries which want <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe also that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> requires a strong South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to make up our minds about which philosophy we support - <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world’s largest <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is India and India’s relationship may as a minimum be described as an ‘entente cor.diale’ with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pakistan is neither a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> nor a communist power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have close relationships with Indonesia, which is neither a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> nor a communist power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also disappointed to hear the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  say that Indonesia was not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it all depends on the inter pretation or definition that one gives to the word ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we should not be doing in this national Parliament is pointing the finger at one of our Asian neighbours and saying: ‘You are not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You do not live up to the same high standards of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that prevail in this country.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time some radically new concepts were introduced into the field of tariff-making, for it is through this that Australian industry - and especially industrial relations and relations between government and industry and workers- can be advanced both in efficiency and in social <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless emphasis is laid on social <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, there can be little advance in efficiency or productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is most likely the most restrictive Parliament in any western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> so far as private members’ business is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is there to do an earnest job; it is not there just to toe the Fine and to show its preparedness to engage in a facade of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go along with the honourable gentleman when he suggests that not only should we be looking at the activities of the types of subversive organisations I have mentioned which engage in threats, intimidation and other kinds of atrocities but that also we should be interested in those which by force and by other forms of objectionable practice are determined to overthrow <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister who, as Leader of this Government has been outstanding in rising to protect the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of many other countries which Australia supports and who believes that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should be protected in other countries, especially in the area of South East Asia, to show some concern for the opinion that these people may have of something that is about to be inflicted upon people within our own nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I challenge him to show the type of leadership that Joh BjelkePetersen claims he does not have, to show it by calling upon the Queensland Premier and the  Deputy  Premier, either publicly if he has the courage or at least privately, to protect the rights of the people of Brisbane and to preserve the style of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which exists in the city of Brisbane for the citizens of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he consider that the widest possible exposure of policies and the fullest opportunity for electors to assess the personal presentation of their prospective representatives and Ministers is desirable in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which depends on a popular vote and freedom of the Press and other media? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision of the Labor Party’s Federal Conference was that we should alter the Act to provide for participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in union affairs, including a provision for the immunity of unions from actions for tort in respect of torts alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of a trade union in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do recognise world citizenship much more freely than does this Government which will not even put a resolution to the United Nations on reform of the United Nations Charter to achieve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at world level because it wants to cut <span class="highlight">democracy</span> off at the national level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Budget sheds a clear if indirect light on several fundamental flaws in the system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reappearance of the stop-go policies is harmful to orderly economic development, yet its causes lie at the very heart of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a disaster for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; it is also disastrously inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To give <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a chance, serious thought must be given to constitutional reform permitting governments to hold office for more than 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hasten to point out that lengthening the term of office is but one of a considerable number of measures needed to make <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My burden on that occasion was principally to examine the proposition that ‘our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not getting the most out of the skilled manpower that sits on the back benches of the 2 chambers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition readily succumbs to majority decisions in the party room and practises true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 main bulwarks of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the freedom of the people to express themselves and to conduct themselves within the framework of the law are Parliament and the law courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an old saying that the wheels of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> grind very slowly, but I hope that from time to time this matter will continue to be raised and that the Government will give serious consideration, when reviewing the estimates for the Parliament, to creating a ministry of sport which I believe will meet with the approval of every honest, decent, public spirited Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the interests of good government and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia the government of the day has to get away from this absurd obsession with secrecy and let the people of Australia know more about what is happening in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The maxim that ignorance of the law does not excuse any subject represents the working hypothesis on which the rule of law rests in British <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are living in what passes for a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> yet you behave like a bunch of ratbags who have not the slightest respect for law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no question of our destroying <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; it is a question of our ensuring that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> can function only through the preservation of the rules and laws that are enacted through a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that some of the Government supporters who believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, who say things about this place which would indicate that they have some appreciation for it, would be ready to object to this kind of procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view is that then we will start to get real <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were experts and academic witnesses and it is healthy, I think for a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have such a controversy among people so qualified to express their opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst I respect the police force and the security service for what they are doing, let us safeguard our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and ensure that things which can destroy that state of affairs that the honourable member for Mcpherson mentioned, things which we all want to see safeguarded, do not creep in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is the very substance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have now found myself in the position to make a contribution to my electors in the Brisbane electorate of Griffith to the electors of Queensland, to the electors of Australia and to the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by directing the attention of the Committee to  a  situation which I believe needs a complete overhaul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are fortunate - despite those who would prefer the rule of the mob and the rule from the streets to prevail - tint we still live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which allows supporters of all sorts of organisations to express freely their points of view, even if the point of view in some cases is to overthrow that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and substitute some sort of totalitarian dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it should be disturbing to anyone who values the continuation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, who values the right of free expression, who values the standards and institutions built up over the years in our society, if it became apparent that these dissident groups were not in tact distinct organisations pursuing their own aims, but were rather operating largely in concert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the things that impresses one about a Committee such as the Public Accounts Committee is that one realises after one leaves this place, where we have our parries and our thrusts, which of course is quite right in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and where we put forward our different points of view, that irrespective of which Party we belong to we know we are all there to do a joh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is one of the great things about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and about our parliamentary system that this occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to join in the compliments that have been paid to them and the service they have given in the interests of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is the people who really govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the people have the right to go wrong - and that is a sobering thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying, as I join in thanking all officers of the House for helping to keep the Parliament going, that honourable members want to beware that we do not lose the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have in our Parliaments in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Press or other media or any person denigrates Parliament or when members of Parliament act with less dignity than they should act as members of Parliament something is taken away from that right which is ours in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to accept the rule of the people through Parliament and so give a fair, equitable and just decision of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My Government intends to place that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on a wider, fairer and firmer basis by granting the vote to men and women at 18 and by removing malapportionment of the electorates for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As those who have spoken have said, I believe that the Parliament must serve a function in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and unless the Parliament meets this requirement the democratic system will cease to operate effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sincerely look forward, and I am sure a great percentage of the Australian people do, to the introduction of a true sense of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into the voting procedures of this country so that we will accept the principle of ‘one vote one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They fully realise that they should accept the challenge that the Labor Party will extend to them to bring <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into the electoral procedures of this nation and accept the challenge of supporting a system of electoral reform that will give voters in the cities a vote of the same value as the vote of people who live in some other parts of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member said: ‘One of the most unjust, pieces of legislation ever introduced in a .so-called <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we on this side of the House talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we mean the right of the Australian people to tell their elected representatives what they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister and the Government talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> they mean the right of the Federal Executive of the Labor Party to tell the Government what to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will not serve this Parliament or this <span class="highlight">democracy</span> well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the great defenders of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, who did not care when it was suggested that 1 minute should be taken away from the Australian Labor Party, find the situation somewhat different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was lovely to see them standing as one in this place, fighting for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and justice and to save one minute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason that they oppose the motion is to try to persuade people outside that they are the defenders of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, free speech and expression in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the House to support the motion and give away one minute in the interests of restoring <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the Parliament and  maintaining the rights of members to vote here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst thousands of young Australians were fighting and dying in South Vietnam to save that country for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> our former Prime Minister was trying desperately to maintain relations with countries which select their sporting teams on the colour of a man’s skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our electoral system should be designed accordingly to ensure that the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we acclaim so loudly is a reality as well as a theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest honour which can come to anyone in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to act as a representative of his or her fellow citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Parliament is to be the nerve centre of the political system it must honour that phrase which is the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - ‘government of the people, by the people, for the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people are to determine their own destinies, which is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about, then democratic practice must coincide with economic reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia, power and wealth are vested in property other than that used for consumption and unless this is shared more equitably, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and this ambituous program will never become a reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party promised greater participation in decision taking - more <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Federal Parliament has within its power the ability to see that we do not have to face another major adversity to make us realise that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, freedom and the Australian way of life we enjoy are not inevitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am heartened by the provisions mentioned in the Governor-General’s Speech, the recognition by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and this Government of the importance of local government in our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ideas are as archaic as they are irrelevant in a modern parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that  His Excellency,  the Governor-General, was reminding the Parliament that if we claim we are a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we must have the characteristics of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and act as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first characteristic of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the government is controlled by the greater number of people represented in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> they have a right to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot deny that if <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to work it is proper that there should be a change of government from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reaction to this realisation has been a surge of pride and nationalism and a revitalisation of people’s belief in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, Parliament and politics as means by which reforms can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have government of the whole people by a section of the people for that section of the people, and that is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basis of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that there is concern for the interests of all the people, that minorities really matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We welcome these Bills not only as Labor’s acknowledgment of what former governments have achieved for the young people of Australia but also because they increase and develop the degree of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country and provide the ordinary Australian greater freedom of choice and more control over his own destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span>, as it has been known in Australia and in other countries with similar systems of government, can work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have said, in effect, that if <span class="highlight">democracy</span> does not work - which really means, does not work in their favour - it is acceptable for people to occupy the streets, to protest through sit-ins, to encroach on government and university property and to commit various other unlawful acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority - if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or parties - it would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amendments provide an opportunity for this Parliament to assert the principle of equality in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - to say whether people in the city are just as equal as the people in the country - not more, not less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn to Queensland, this bastion of selected <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where the Country Party reigns; where redistribution of boundaries has been the scorn of the Party since 1958; where it is possible for the Labor Party to gain 46.75 per cent of the votes, more than the combined votes of the Liberal and Country parties (42.23 per cent) and to win only 33 seats as against 47 for the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One could chide the previous government, but I suppose that there is scarcely an example anywhere of a western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that has been very successful in holding the line as far as prices are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is understandable that some Yugoslav migrants of Croatian origin should continue to hope for the establishment of an independent Croatia and within a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> like Australia they have a right to advocate their views so long as they do so by legitimate means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot of people are talking very good sense about participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe and this Government believes that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> wage control is neither desirable nor practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right to equal representation in this national Parliament of people living in country areas is essential for the maintenance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the prime consideration of whether Parliamentary proceedings should be televised is whether or not parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be strengthened as a result of our allowing the proceedings of this Parliament to go on television to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be strengthened and advanced by televising proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is best served by a maximum participation by the general public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The expression to which I refer is ‘those fundamental principles of human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, can it really be argued that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be subverted because we are unwilling to have the electorate of Kalgoorlie, already occupying most of the State of Western Australia, occupy even more of the State or that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is subverted because the electorate of Kennedy or of Darling is to occupy an even greater part of their States rather than be left as they are? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must be preserved and be seen to be preserved; secondly, electorates should as near as practicable, be equal in numbers through the expected lifetime of the distribution; thirdly, to prevent excessive sectional representation in the Parliament and, fourthly, to prevent the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is untrue and it will not weaken our resolve to protect the parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of Australia as we see it and we are committed to keep it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral processes are manipulated to serve the political interests of persons or parties it would be a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can we regard Labor as being transported bv objectivity and altruism in the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But are we to believe from the Australian Labor Party’s insinuations that in Britain, where constituencies vary from between 40,000 to 80,000 electors, there is an insidious, nasty gerrymander that is destroying the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had great difficulty in getting elementary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measure before the Parliament concerns <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case some of the honourable members who are at present in this place and some of those who have taken part in this debate have forgotten I remind them that there is a very good definition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which I should revive for the occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a definition by Abraham Lincoln, not unknown in our country and in our history, who defined <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as ‘government of the people by the people and for the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listening to the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony),  who spoke just before the sitting was suspended for dinner, we could be forgiven for thinking that he was talking about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in terms of government of the majority by the minority because that seemed to be the summation of what he was saying; but then again he seemed to have a remorse of conscience once or twice during the course of his remarks and he said: Unbalanced representation is not good for the nation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this is a very good and new definition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is indeed a new definition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was very interested to hear his references to Tasmania and his concern that there has not been full <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about the city; we are talking about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> in Australia in 1973! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a spectacle for Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are tonight in the national Parliament talking about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we have somebody who wishes to enshrine privilege, not to spread <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the boundaries of an electorate are artificially drawn and it is held through this artificial system or carries with it an artificial privilege this is a negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a further debate at some future time on the philosophy of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in relation to representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister talked about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and all sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us put ourselves in the position of living in an electorate adjoining thai of Hindmarsh, held by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  that zealot for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To remove from consideration such factors as area, remoteness and sparsity of population is flying in the fact of commonsense and, to use the Minister’s own words is making a mockery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must be preserved and be seen to be preserved; secondly, electorates should as near as practicable, be equal in numbers through the expected lifetime of the distribution; thirdly, to prevent excessive sectional representation in the Parliament; and, fourthly, to prevent the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has made speeches in which he has strongly supported the present system of election to this House and the present form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which exists in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority - if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or parties - it would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France is another example where the fight for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst our own situation has been to a certain extent free from the violence of many other countries in their aspirations to seek fair and democratic representation for their people, our own past shows that the political struggles to establish our own form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> have been a continuing political confrontation with the Establishment and the forces of privilege, and unfortunately this political fight for fair and democratic representation has not been finally won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Efforts to give this upper House some semblance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the past have always been rebuffed by the use of the undemocratic power that it has consistently used against the political interests of the people of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every other State upper House we find conditions that have some parallel with the South Australian Legislative Council situation, and until these Houses are reformed to reflect the political wishes of the majority of the people we cannot say that we are a true <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  wanting an FBItype political police force for himself, and now tonight we have the last straw from the last bastion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that I thought we had in this place, the Minister for Services and Property, who when on this side of the House used to make great speeches about the rights of individual members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall the great speeches he has made in the past in support of the Parliament and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but here tonight he is wanting to gag the people’s representatives in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the last straw - the Minister for Services and Property wants to gag <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and gag the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the information available to us it appears that the Government intends to gag 17 members on this side of the House who wish to speak on a matter of quite fundamental importance to the future of this Parliament and representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Prime Minister it is open season on all whether they have the right to reply or not, and for members of this Parliament it is the gag denying them the right to speak on matters which are of fundamental importance to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the great defenders of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> opposite demanding that Standing Orders be suspended to enable them to debate this great issue that is before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all I want to do is to throw back to the Minister the very words he used in the debate on the second reading: ‘What a mockery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; what a gerrymander’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision will not establish <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; it is a denial of the rights of electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arguments for unequal electorates and special weighting of country areas came strangely from a party that has always placed great emphasis on the equalitarian aspects of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one disagrees with the slogan of one man one vote, but what this really means is that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the government should be won by the party which obtains a majority of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The minority party in Queensland - the Country Party, which supplies the Premier - with the lowest percentage of votes exercises supreme control in that bastion of Country Party <span class="highlight">democracy</span> with the help of the greatest gerrymander in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who tend towards <span class="highlight">democracy</span> agree that this is something that should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man is one of the people who tell you that they believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no cause in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to pervert the course of justice because a government does not give members adequate facilities to represent the people by whom they are sent to this Parliament to state a case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is regarded here as revolutionary when we change a few things to bring more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things want to be carefully pondered ere honourable members opposite rush wildly into rejecting this legislation, which is vital in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be sustained in a political <span class="highlight">democracy</span> only as long as there is a voice to represent country people and as long as this voice has some numbers behind it to render it effectual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any dramatic alteration of our electoral laws, as proposed here, will not alter the vital composition of this place as regards ideology or philosophy, but <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be threatened in that it will make for the tyranny of a 2-party system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments made to the Electoral Act in 1965 showed that the Country Party was prepared to ride rough shod over <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to ensure its political survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The loading of 20 per cent was the price at which its coalition partners, the Liberal Party, valued <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in bowing to this demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  would rather cloud the issue and allow one electorate to be twice as large as another than speak in defence of the principle of one vote one value, the most basic principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am rather amazed at the attitude of the Liberal Party which for so long has said that it believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and used other words which tend to mean the same thing, f am amazed that it has not seized the opportunity presented by the introduction of this Bill to put a few teeth into its sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes people frustrated with the system which we call <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and which most of us in this place - I hope, all of us - uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask this House to agree to this clause and to carry the Bill because I believe that the measure will be to the ultimate advantage of the Australian people and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is on trial tonight is the basic concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not the basis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, interference in matters such as this normally might be unwise but I submit that in this matter we should consider the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Vietnam, a cause for which over 450 young Australians sacrificed their lives and on which the Australian Government expended countless millions of dollars of this country’s money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of the preservation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, if it exists in that country today, and more so in the cause of humanity, I urge the Prime Minister and this Government clearly to express their grave concern for the outrageous injustices suffered by these 5 young people and to initiate every possible action to arrange with the South Vietnamese Government for the release of these young prisoners of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure you,  Mr Speaker,  that the Opposition recognises in this move the whole future of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is contemptuous of any concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has such a service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought I would put the record straight and bring honourable members up to date and just warn them in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country not to waste the time of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shows a true spirit of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and it is in keeping with the highest traditions of this Parliament and the great men who have occupied your position before you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the debate in this House we heard expressions like ‘gerrymander’, ‘end of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ and similar nonsense, yet similar action is being taken much more frequently than is contemplated here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, we insist on <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the government of these larger groupings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be an essential ingredient for the proper functioning of the amalgamated unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is anybody in this House who is not a parliamentarian he will vote against the suspension of Standing Orders, but anybody in this House who is committed to the parliamentary system, and to the sense of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the way it has been built up by people over the centuries will vote for the suspension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a very sorry episode in the history of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately the process of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was put into being and, of course, the matter was taken to the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has not given any reason for introducing this provision except in the euphemistic name of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we are to preserve our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we should have such a system - by which men in high positions of trust, even the judiciary and other men in high, influential legal positions, should have to declare their assets when they accept a responsible position and every 3 years thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no knowledge of any deviation from what I would regard as a basic principle in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member interjected, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is under attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar voted for the motion which sets out the allotment of time in connection with those Bills, as also did the honourable member for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon)  and all the saviours of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> who sit opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what was done by the previous Government, supporters of which now talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  mention, firstly, the need in a representative parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of this character, which this Parliament represents in Australia, to keep it the major forum for political debate and discussion in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, this Parliament, with all its imperfections, is the major expression of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it would be a difficult amendment to carry … Be that as it may, the situation is that as long as this is a bicameral legislature, in the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and decency people throughout the nation should have a vote for both chambers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restoration of Parliament as the principal organ of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and social and economic change, the maintenance of effective Parliamentary supervision over the administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal is spoken about the relationship between <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This might be called the responsive aspect of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might well ask the question: What sort of responsive <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists when the authority is paralysed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest very seriously to members of this House, including the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, that it is important when distributing powers in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have checks and balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should people who live in Canberra, many of whom after all have come from electorates that honourable members in this place represent, suddenly, upon coming to the ACT, cease to have the privileges that other Australians enjoy, the privileges of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and representation which we all so correctly support for the people in other areas of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can anybody argue against the fundamental <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of giving people proper representation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say to him: Do not give us lectures in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the honourable member for Wentworth can give us lectures in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when it comes to discussing the conferring of voting rights on members of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also place on record my commendation, after a long period in Parliament, of their impartiality, integrity and the contribution that they make to the workings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister commenced in office by setting the most dangerous precedent to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have ever seen in this country - a government of 2 men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not seeing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work as it should work, yet the Prime Minister had the audacity to enter this House and preen himself about the number of Bills that had gone through this House during this session of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a beacon-light of idealism for all who believe that any system of society which is not founded on political <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, social <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and economic <span class="highlight">democracy</span>-any system which is not characterised in all its aspects by equalityis a bad one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must also say that he was a great inspiration to me personally as the epitome of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and an egalitarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  retained his seat with an increased majority, and to the greater glory of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the former member for Bendigo lost his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that is being said here in a simple way - the gallery has perceived the significance of the point - is that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as it relates to the functioning of the House is not being well served because, contrary to what the Government has put forward in relation to its concept of open government, it has denied that concept in question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government by the people, the rule of law and the equality of all citizens before the law are basic points and the very foundation on which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Leader of the Country Party that nothing is surer than when a vote is taken in this Parliament tonight a majority of members will stand on the side of true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - will stand for equality of rights for all Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the greatest dangers facing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country is a centralised and monopolistic education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article concludes by saying: ‘<span class="highlight">Democracy</span> died last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without communication <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in its fullest sense is an idle dream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also hold the view that private individuals in our free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should at all times express their opinions on the route that a road should take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the long term every Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will have to have a prices and incomes policy because neither the existing mechanisms for market forces for adjudicating prices nor the existing mechanisms for determining wages are just or adequate in the technological age in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  you are a man of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and will understand why I am personally upset that the Minister who has had many occasions to confirm or deny these allegations has seen fit once again to run from the concern which I express on behalf of 50,000 Brisbane citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that every member of this House who professes to defend the cause of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of cabinet government will wholeheartedly support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to you that the interests of this Parliament, the interests of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the interests of sticking to the rules of the House require you to say today to the honourable member for Sturt: ‘You are correct’, and then to say to the Minister for Defence: ‘You shall table today the whole of the document, and not that selected part which you have torn off from the document’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the Minister’s object, this Bill does not achieve it because some of his proposals concerning union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would seriously weaken the negotiating power of such officials in industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would be aware that there was a classic case at the Ford factory of union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being debased and dishonoured by union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, as honourable members know, this practice demonstrates a real approach to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they will do that again and whether that acrobatic stunt will prevent <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being given to these Territories, I am not in a position to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is - at least so I thought until a few moments ago - still a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but the way in which the Government is handling this Bill shows that it has no commitment to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything that goes out from this Parliament to the last days of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will have the usual old heading concerning the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the greatest features of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that I know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have not seen in New Zealand a situation in which it could be said that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has been damaged in any way and I think the New Zealand people would object very greatly to such a suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, would anybody in this Parliament claim that the United Kingdom is not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Wide Bay has said, the United Kingdom has been a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> since they got rid of the rotten boroughs - in other words, the gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the facts are that this Parliament has far less power than the parliament of practically any other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You have continued to rape <span class="highlight">democracy</span> without shame for 8 long months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This tiger wants to lead us along the garden path and have us believe that really all he wants to do is to provide for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as ours, if there is a conflict between a duly elected Minister and his departmental head it should not be the Minister who is replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are certain basic rules of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom which state that there should be equality under the law but it is often overlooked that to obtain equality under the law we also need equality of access to h law if we are to protect those freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plain fact is that this Government apparently is intent on interring <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this House; the Government apparently will not learn the lesson of the Parramatta byelection and the Greensborough and Murray by-elections in the State of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You know,  Mr Speaker,  in another great English speaking <span class="highlight">democracy</span> recently there were people who were protesting that they would brazen it out; the dirty tricks could not come home to them; they would survive; they would go to the parliament; they would go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view a mockery will be made of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia if it is not acknowledged that the place in which governments are made and unmade is the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the proposals from the Minister for Labour which will be found to be unworkable and which will not assist the cause of industrial peace is his proposal for industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having said so much, I place on record without any apology the attitude of this Government towards parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the efforts we have made to ensure that the people opposite get the right to speak, as they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is of particular importance because this country does not have a long history of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is as concerned about the manner in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> works as he appears to be in his utterances in this Parliament, I believe that his approach to the matter I now raise will be the test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Bowman cared to go through the Hansard reports since just after I arrived here in 1966 he would find repeated pleas from myself to the Government of the day to alter the postal voting system in the name of fairness and in the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Senate has been designed not to be a replica or a rubber stamp of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government sees the Senate as a frustration, as an annoyance or as an inconvenience, this is part of the price we pay for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, if the referendum were passed, it would be imposing on this Parliament and upon the State Parliaments conditions which would not contribute to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but would make <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in certain areas unworkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a basic, fundamental principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that all people must be regarded as equal and must be treated as equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But attempts to frustrate the effective implementation of this widely accepted basis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> continue to this day led by every member of the Australian Country Party and their lap dogs along at their heels, the members of the Liberal Party supporting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  the Parliament today has sunk to a level the like of which no other Parliament in the world which treasures <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely no person who believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Parliament the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rests on the Government and the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that many of the commissions which have been implemented prior to this one have not included such a broadly based involvement of community groups, but that is no reason why we should not, if you like, learn from the mistakes of the past or try it a new way when the cry is for increased community participation and a sense of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seemed to cherish the rather naive idea that if they wanted to prevent something, all they had to do was to pass a law prohibiting it; they did not understand, as students of jurisprudence do, that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, except in grave emergency, laws which restrict the citizen too much and which are confusing and appear to be unfair, simply will not be obeyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I repeat here what I have said in this House on several occasions: I believe that every western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will in the next few years have to evolve something that is described as a prices and incomes policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the day comes that this Parliament is prepared to set up an outside body and tell that outside body: ‘You can do what you like and we are bound to follow it’, we are abandoning parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us here- members, public servants and the Press - combine to make the institution of parliamentary government a living’ vital thing, an experience in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which has matchless qualities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this represents <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I fail to understand the meaning of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not doing this from any intuition that it is serving <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; the Government is doing this because it believes that such a policy will favour the Australian Labor Party in votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>

    <p>It is quite understandable that the vested interests represented by the members opposite should do their utmost to block the strengthening of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposes the permanent protection of these rights by an amendment of the Constitution so that they may never foe taken away by the enemies of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These measures will place democratic institutions in Australia on a firmer foundation and will forestall the possibility of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being usurped by totalitarian parties of the right or the left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the will of the people must prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing more nor less than the maintenance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country is behind the ideas which brought forward this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is a word that should have some difficulty in tumbling from the honourable gentleman’s lips. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is not something that people should incline themselves to when the occasion demands, and neither is it something to be treated as a toy of those who command power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few minutes ago the Leader of the House spoke about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and masqueraded as the great father of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would best be served by allowing the elected representatives of the people in this House to discuss measures which ultimately will be put to them for decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Mackellar said, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is kept alive in Australia under this Government by the activities of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this House is to be reduced to a rubber stamp at the whim of the Government by its taking action without any arrangement as to time, that is the end of the real principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have got through more Bills and we have sat longer hours, and all these protectors of liberty and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> now say that we are doing the wrong thing by Australia and by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is simple <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that they should have a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House parades as a paragon of virtue and the upholder of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but as has been said before and will be said again, during his time as Leader of this House <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is continually raped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate him and other members of the Opposition in improving their approach to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> since they have spent 6 months in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is true <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and that does not apply on the other side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that our primary responsibility is to ensure that this Parliament remains the home of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that it does not vacate its power or authority to an unrepresentative, unanswerable and increasingly influential pressure group, whether it be European or of some other nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this House this afternoon Government speakers proudly announced: ‘Oh, we are a great <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussion on ‘Parliamentary Government’ generally showed that within the Commonwealth there were several divergent views, and underlined the fact that the Westminster model of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is no longer a common characteristic of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate, however, was conducted with tolerant understanding by the several proponents of differing forms of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, each recognising that the form taken in the separate countries of the Commonwealth must depend to a great degree on national life in these countries and the stan dard of education and culture and on their state of economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are members of this House who will recall that Winston Churchill told the House of Commons in 1947 that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the worst form of government except all the other forms that have been tried from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members who attach an equal or greater value to the institution of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must view with alarm the loss of confidence in those institutions which is being revealed at successive elections around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians have not as yet lost all faith in their Parliament, but cynical displays of shadow-boxing such as those to which the House was subjected this afternoon by honourable members opposite will ultimately make the nation turn away from <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in despair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He talks of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever there was a mockery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have seen it in Queensland and that is why the Labor Party is rejected in Queensland and why the people of Queensland will throw out this referendum proposal without a second thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland knows the sincerity of the Labor Party that now goes to it saying: *We will give you <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to talk on many other matters, but I do want to say that the people of Queensland are sick and tired of a government which is trying to take away their rights and which loses no opportunity to denigrate their Premier and their Government and to impose a system that is not democratic but is the very antithesis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have had to wait for the Labor Party to come to office before these proposals could be put to the people in an attempt to gain some measure of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of justice for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the Cocos Islands, as the honourable gentleman knows, are very far from a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens when a government attempts to govern without restraint and when a Prime Minister in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> acts as a dictator in a 2-man dictatorship is that the Prime Minister builds expectations - great expectations - which he cannot subsequently live up to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talks about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being trodden on by jackboots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not hear any more talk about jackboots treading on <span class="highlight">democracy</span> until we get anything remotely near the previous Government’s appalling performance of passing 17 Bills in one night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless statements are made in the House where members can hear them, where what is said is recorded, and where one can hold Ministers to statements which they make in the House and sheet responsibility home to them, then parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country has arrived at a very sorry note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is there to do an earnest job; lt is not there just to toe the line and to show its preparedness to engage in a facade of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to bring home to you is that if you do not permit me to continue you are not only sitting me down and silencing me but you are depriving all the people of Australia of the right of true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where the Opposition can state a point of view in this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to work, and if there is to be free expression by the people in this Parliament, we have a right to a certain amount of the debating time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we make a plea on behalf of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the proper working of this House that this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders be carried to allow proper debate on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, that is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable member that this is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and he is not the only member of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Parliament gets to the stage where the  Speaker  can determine what interjections go into the Hansard report and what do not, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will have come to a very sad state and the rules of this Parliament will have been changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently if we were to restrict aid to countries that conformed to our concept of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we would not be giving much assistance at all so I think that any consideration requires a large degree of tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is political only in the sense that the people belonging to it are committed to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and opposed to any decline in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> wherever it may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">democracy</span> requires civil and political rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quite depressing to me when I was attending the United Nations to find that so many of the resolutions coming forward criticising other countries for an alleged lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of political freedoms were often sponsored by countries which almost never exceeded the six or seven ranking, which represents the bottom of the possibilities for both political and civil rights, and that countries where the people obviously have no political or civil rights were continuously ranting about alleged interference with freedom in other countries that admittedly also had relatively poor rankings but which certainly were no worse off than the people who were criticising them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as the Westminster style of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may not always be the most immediately suitable for all countries, so perhaps the Australian style of drafting may not always be the most suitable system of law in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further than that, President Pompidou was the leader of a country which is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and which is a traditional and close friend of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, it is my opinion that the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  again demonstrated an attitude which is too frequently being expressed by Labor Government supporters, namely, that there is no role within the function of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for people to oppose a point of view expressed by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>The policy that this Government pursues of a circumscribed debate in this House is as ludicrous as some of the other statements by the Leader of the House as to the way in which justice and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are served here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the tragedies of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> throughout the world is that it is harder and harder for parliaments, as institutions, to make governments look down the barrel of the gun when circumstances demand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If somebody cares to divide $2, 300m by 15 he will get an idea of what sort of a spendthrift government this is, and he will get an idea of what sort of a government this is which treats parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If ever a situation has demonstrated that this Government has no concept of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> from start to finish, it is this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Behind the question is the arrogant assumption that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the preserve of the Westminister system and a lack of appreciation for the sophisticated party and parliamentary system which Tanzania has evolved to meet the particular needs of its people and to achieve in the words of President Nyerere “development on the basis of human equality and human dignity”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House is the place where the people’s voice is to be heard; it is the cornerstone of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>totally unacceptable to the normal practice of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He recognised that the Senate could only damage itself by such falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made a calm, brilliant, rational and extremely well argued speech in which he showed that anybody believing in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> had to oppose that referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way I believe that the rights and privileges of the private member can best be protected and the prospects for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this chamber enhanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear that it is determined to stifle debate and to push through legislation without any regard for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority - if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or parties - it would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is fundamental to the concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at its worst when such an important Bill with such wide ramifications and to which the attention of the whole nation will be directed is treated in such a shabby manner by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Britain is the home of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and it recognises that for some of the outlying electorates in the north of Scotland there needs to be consideration for the difficulties of a member getting around and for constitutents being able to see their member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in the best interests of the workings of this Parliament, of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one does not stand for equality of electorates one does not stand for anything in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is essential for the continuation and respect of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the electorates in this Parliament be as close to equal in terms of electors as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that it was something that was against <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for flooding the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the whole of the precept of the Labor Party in this legislation before us tonight is designed not to enhance <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not to add to the political voice, but rather to add to the power of the Labor Party, to give it a chance of having a majority in the Senate and to give it the opportunity to manipulate the power base by changing the electoral laws to ensure it perpetuity of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they feel that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is suffering, may I respectfully suggest that they put this question on the agenda for their next Party meeting so that  Mr Daly  as Leader of the House will be aware that Government supporters have in recent months been complaining about the situation which presently exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask you,  Mr Speaker:  In the interests of restoring at least some suggestion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this House - taking into account the fact that you have stated often that you cannot dictate to a Minister how he answers a question - would you dictate to Ministers that they should answer the questions and give the information requested? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By every standard of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Labor Government received a renewal of its mandate, a new endorsement of its policies, from the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The form our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will take is barely visible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task we face in this Parliament, if we are really concerned to build a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, is to find and tread that delicate line which will achieve complete social justice for all while affording the greatest individual freedom in personal, social and economic affairs consistent with a basic concern for others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Government-  upon which both successful parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and good government depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the sovereign State of Queensland, that great believer in equality and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, considered the tour of such national importance that he declared a state of emergency for the duration of the tour in his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government stands condemned for the 4 reasons that are outlined in the motion now before the House; the Government stands condemned because it has failed to uphold the principles by which parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should work; and the Government stands condemned because henceforth any fall in the Australian wool market will be not the fault of the Australian Wool Corporation and not the fault of the market forces that previous spokesmen have tended to support but the fault of Labor machination in order to assert and abuse the power which, fortunately, will not be Labor’s for long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not unitary rule by Whitlam but divided power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is divided power - divided between the chambers, divided between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> no government is above its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party perverted <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by endeavouring to pull a swifty with the appointment of  Senator Gair  to Ireland, the Minister for Services and Property personally directed that the senator’s large suite of offices reserved for a party leader be locked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lengths to which the present Government will prostitute itself and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in order to preserve what it considers its future are unbelievable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>When the Minister for Services and Property has responsibility for such matters as redistribution under the electoral Acts, the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the freedom of this nation are at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Downing says that if inflation persists at the rate that exists today, the very <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have in this country will be in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, I believe quite strongly that if a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to function properly and successfully it is vitally essential to have a free Press with the unfettered right to express a viewpoint without being inhibited in any shape or form, provided the opinion expressed in an editorial is presented in an acceptable form, whether it be constructive or destructive criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The package of measures agreed to last night, if they pass the Caucus and the Senate, is the most calculatedly deflationary ever undertaken by an Australian government, or indeed any western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> plagued by the same problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, how valid is the claim to industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite come into this place after such a great display of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by their Party and start talking to us about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  treated us to a great dissertation on the thing that he holds dearest to his heart, that is, <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  I know, is concerned about union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does believe in union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the greatest respect, if the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment - if he is prepared to let the ballot provisions go on as they do in that particular union - we know that we need not believe anything he says about rank and file control or union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ever again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Government is looking at this Bill as an example of what has been called participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which it seeks to have introduced into the Australian union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the name of participatory’ <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Government speaks of involving the rank and file in agreements which are made in order to settle industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the idea of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> I suggest that it distorts the very basis of union organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that the Opposition does not want to see any alteration to the legislation which allows unions to by-pass or to subvert the arbitration system which has been established in Australia in the name of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to give to rank and file members the opportunity to overturn decisions of committees of management in the way proposed and this is done in the name of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Labor Party says that the will of Caucus must prevail; there must be participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by all members of the Labor Party in the decisions made by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole process has become a distortion of the parliamentary process, a distortion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to use  Sir Robert  Menzies’ phrase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These Opposition senators led from behind by the Leader of the Opposition denying all the things which he advocated in government are the white ants of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Uncontrolled inflation is the enemy of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but more democracies have been destroyed by the irresponsibility of parliaments than have ever been destroyed by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is everywhere under challenge - in North America, western Europe, Japan - I call upon the Australian Opposition to realise at last the recklessness and irresponsibility of the role it has chosen for itself as a government in exile in the Senate for the past 18 months, a role re soundingly rejected by the Australian people a mere 10 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few days ago Professor Downing, the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and a very eminent economist, warned of the possibility of a collapse of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if inflation continued unchecked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had the extraordinary spectacle of the Prime Minister saying that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being white-anted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  can talk about white-anting <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but what are we here for? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that power is spread between Commonwealth Government, State governments, local government bodies and their respective employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been rightly described by  Sir Robert  Menzies as a falsification of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if on any matter of Government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fitting that the first Bill to come before this first Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament should be designed to strengthen the equality of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To resist that simple, clear and basic principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have had this long campaign of obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a possible disparity in the value of votes is inconsistent with the full realisation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For its content and its implications, for its real value and its symbolic importance, for its contribution to the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a world where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> seems daily more frail, I commend this Bill to honourable senators and members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are resolved not to let legislation go through the House of Representatives and the Senate which we believe is bad in principle and which would detract from the constitutional principles of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are looking for true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> why have we allowed this to happen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have a quick look at what happens in some of the other countries with no less an attachment to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and equality of representation than we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia did not give a mandate to this Government to change the whole nature of the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no other way to look at Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral processes are manipulated to serve the political interests of persons or parties it would be a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam gave us one of his lectures about how <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is so frail in Australia at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not hear him say anything about what Mr Mundey said yesterday when he was attacking <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does Mr Whitlam talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being frail in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is frail in Australia because one chamber of this Parliament is prepared to exercise its rights which it was guaranteed under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and his Party are the people who are putting <span class="highlight">democracy</span> under attack in this country, not the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stood here and lectured us about the frailty of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when he and his Party and his supporters outside are doing more to pull it down than anybody else in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister stood up here and lectured us, as he so often does, about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and about what that great Chief Justice Earl Warren said in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, he certainly did not advert to the Supreme Court case of February 1973 involving the State of Virginia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority- if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or partiesit would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only those who believe in a selective form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will oppose the principle of equality of voting and the elections of governments by the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Country Party depend on this form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for their survival, individually and as a Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last vestige of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has gone under the administration of the Country Party Government in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In defence of his Party’s vested interests in this Parliament and throughout the country he has deliberately sought to abandon a vital aspect of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> upheld by successive Labor Prime MinistersWatson, Fisher, Scullin, Curtin and Chifley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Prime Minister who is prepared to come into this chamber, on an occasion such as this, and, mouth the fundamentals of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but who clearly is unable to provide leadership for the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at the present time is not capable of maintaining the confidence of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is supposed to be <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great surprise to me that the Liberal Party which, at the turn of the electoral wheel, might one day-a long way off I feelbecome the government of this country in its own right, will never, as it sells out to the Country Party and allows that weighing of electorates, achieve what should be the objective in a 2-Party system which relies on traditional Westminster style <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of governing in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That every citizen should have an equal voice in the Parliament is the very basis and foundation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that situation does not endure <span class="highlight">democracy</span> does not endure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, at this Joint Sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, this historic occasion, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia is on trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let those who stand for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> speak today in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real problem of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country is the sham of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not do much good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have people sitting here for 20 years because they effectively and safely represent very small areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be much better from the point of view of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if seats were made more marginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the Senate white-anting <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but I simply remind him and others that the Senate has just been re-elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>.All this idea of a handful of men getting hold of the State machine, having the right to make the people do what suits their party and personal interests or doctrine is completely contrary to every conception of surviving western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From listening to the supporters of the present Government speaking on this Bill today one would gain the impression that they believe that they have a monopoly or concern for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure all honourable senators and members that this is not so, and that the LiberalCountry Party coalition Opposition feels just as strongly about what must be preserved in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as does any other member of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preservation of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is possibly the greatest responsibility which lies in the hands of the members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> will never be perfect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Chief Electoral Officer and the Electoral Officers in each State have shown, by the results in the past 2V4 decades, that they have been men who have taken notice of the need to preserve our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we send our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> down the drain we are losing everything in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, that preserves the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which allows the honourable member for Grayndler, with all his weaknesses, to come into this place and to promote and propose legislation which is to the detriment of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I sincerely hope that, when this legislation has passed this Parliament and finally goes to the Electoral Commissioners to be implemented in the redistribution of the electoral boundaries of this nation, they recognise the tremendous need to preserve the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we have followed for three-quarters of a century under both nonLabor and Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a minimum requirement of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that they should be so represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet you describe us and particularly my Senate colleagues as being the white anters of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, an expression used last week by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You claim to be the champions of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and yet in Government you have used the gag and the guillotine in that short period of time more frequently than any other party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To use your own terminology, you are not merely the white anters of the Parliament or of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, and in order that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may have a chance to survive in this country, I firmly believe in the abolition of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason has nothing to do with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or democratic principles, because if ever there was a bunch of politicians in this country lacking in principle it is those on the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or is it socialism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its actions strike at the fundamental concepts of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measure of the government in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> surely must be its capacity and performance in preventing exploitation, whether it be exploitation of individuals, groups of individuals, of resources or indeed of freedom itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 6 Bills found their way to this Joint Sitting and they are opposed even in this last hour by the Liberal and Country Parties, not out of wanton obstructionism but because this side of the chamber, representative of opinion held over a wide spectrum of the Australian people, believes that they are bad in principle and are likely to detract from the effectiveness of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another place that obstructionist Opposition which has thrown overboard every semblance of decency and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is forcing the Australian people to suffer unless we put this legislation through today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another place it is comprised of a lot of doddering old supporters who are holding up <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason we are back here today is that the so-called obstructionist Senate, about which the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  was so pleased to talk earlier, has done its job by <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the nation, the State governments and local government bodies throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude on the point that the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is divided power and the essence of parliamentary proceedings in this House is fairness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> includes the opportunity for minorities to have their voices heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I venture to say that not one comparable <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has to deal with the obstruction, the pettiness, the unpredictability, the time-wasting energyconsuming nonsense which this Government has suffered at the hands of the Leader of the Opposition’s nominal followers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of Parliament should make every reasonable effort to avoid even the appearance of those conflicts of interest that are not inherent in a representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a process that would help <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it think that that would serve the path of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> properly for the future of this nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the emotional and meaningless headlines we see in the newspapers from time to time about the Caucus rebuffing the Ministry, we will continue to practice participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and those who are the Ministers Will expect us to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because the Australian Labor Party, through its activities and through its efforts to stifle freedom of speech and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, is setting out to reduce to nothing more than a farce and a laugh the talk back programs in which people ring radio stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only fair in the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that a system be devised to ensure that all get a fair crack of the whip and the arrangement is not exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some responsible commentators have warned the citizens of democratic countries that raging rates of inflation such as we are experiencing now may ultimately threaten our system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in a modern <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the control of inflation is more than merely the duty of the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regretted that this has the effect of silencing <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite want <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to function in this Parliament and they want the opportunity to ask more questions, thus enabling them to put their points of view through questions, it is about time that they told the Leader of the Opposition that he should cease asking his dreary, dull questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property, with his usual indulgence and sense of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and open government might tell me whether he is prepared to have the minutes of this meeting incorporated in the Hansard record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not a Budget because it does not meet the fundamental requirements of any Budget in an English speaking community which believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the Cabinet system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Premier of New South Wales, the Honourable J. T. Lang, who is now one of the patriarchs of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and who is in his nineties, wrote a very interesting article in which he compared 1930 with 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor member chose to speak about social consciousness, social issues and the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that exists fundamentally in the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> may well have its problems but let no one make any mistake about where the Labor Party stands on its structural make-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> does pose problems but the fundamental point to make at this stage is not whether <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is good or bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time of inflation and of economic downturns in the community and of significant unrest in the community, it is up to those of us in this House who should surely be supporting parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to make it quite clear that we dissociate ourselves from those sorts of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In so many ways- and this comes up every time we debate the estimates in this Parliament- we seek to get <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the cheap, and if we seek to get <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the cheap we will get cheap <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an individual I am not worried by the amount of work which comes in because if I cannot answer a letter today, tomorrow or next week, it has to wait, but the regrettable fact is that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia is slowly grinding to a halt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes those curious forms of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span> known as ‘talk-backs’ seem to suggest that they are the only ones who ever consider this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Lilley wants to help the Government cure the problem we are now discussing, why does he not get the Opposition senators by the scruff of the neck and tell them to remember that they are Australians living in a country that is supposed to be a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> governed by a Parliament, and that the government chosen by the people to govern has a right to govern? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that those champions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> up there in the Press gallery, who ridiculed us for years any time we gagged a motion, might for once look at this example of jackboot <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, if one could call it that, and blow up for the public to contemplate the actions of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These days we talk increasingly of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that only has meaning if people in communities are allowed to govern themselves and to influence the quality of their lives and the quality of the life we live in Tasmania is presumably related to the sort of judgments we make about compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to the honourable member for Port Adelaide let me say that it is true that the Queensland Premier survives on 19 per cent of the votes of the guided <span class="highlight">democracy</span> known as Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure them that under the democratic proposals of the present Whitlam Government such a state of affairs will never happen in the Federal arena where people will have to get the majority of the votes to get the results that are necessary in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and that is democratic majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party talks about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but its words are very empty when I can cite here in this chamber an example such as that I spoke of a moment ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and if this Parliament is to be active as it is supposed to be in the interests of the Australian people we need to discuss these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to do so in the interests of Australia, in the interests of true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in the interests of the people because that is what is important in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Parliament cannot rely on the veracity and credibility of information which it seeks from the Government and which the Government gives, the whole fabric of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of responsible government is destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Queensland has been dead since the Liberal Party threw away the opportunity of a reasonable redistribution of electoral boundaries on the last occasion that Jackboots Joh, the Premier, stood over its members and forced through the Parliament a redistribution that guaranteed the preservation of his Party- the Country Party as it then was- as the leading Party in the coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  has made clear, the Senate once again has shown that, far from being obstructive of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, it is safeguarding <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country by holding up hasty legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that those who have an interest in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> stop knocking the Senate in this most desirable aspect of its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From where do you get your principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to speak as a nation and speak up for the children ofthe future on the basis that this is a great country with a good <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we know how to manage our own affairs and our own resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of legislation is common to any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and I believe it should be retained so that the town planning program can be developed by the elected representatives of the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is paramount in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deny <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to deny the spirit of which I earlier spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-During the past week this House, this Parliament and this nation, have witnessed the beginning of the end of the institution of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Westminster system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends on 2 things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that it will be very much to the discredit of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country if this convention is not followed in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not just a matter of having the numbers in the Senate because if convention is going to be altered in this way and we can get into a situation where people are appointed at the whim of various State Premiers or State Cabinets, where the political circumstances of the day decide how appointments are to be made and in what numbers, then the very fabric of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be in danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely they are the people more than anyone else who would want to preserve the custom and convention of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but no, in this case, as unfortunately in many other cases they have decided to disregard the convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the people of Australia realised that some of the people who sit opposite- not all of them- and some of the people who back them are not prepared to accept <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia as we have come to know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will go to any lengths to stop these things coming into operation so that the Opposition can keep the power which it desires, so that it can stop the reforms which the people of Australia want and so that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia can no longer be viable as we all hope it could be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether even at this late stage he will not make it clear to the Premier of New South Wales,  Mr Lewis,  not with the equivocation which he has so far shown on the great issue before us all at the present time, that if the Premier does not retreat from the stand that he has taken on the filling of the current Senate vacancy he, the Leader of the Opposition, the man bound to uphold the traditions of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, will not appear with  Mr Lewis  on the platform at the public meeting which is to be held at Randwick race course next Sunday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very seldom in the history of our country has parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> been tested or challenged as it is being tested and challenged at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is occurring at a time when <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is under siege around the globe and when the lights are going out one by one around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries in which a true parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can still be said to exist are few and far between. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this House would all agree that the maintenance of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends upon the willingness of the people to be governed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a serious point, I believe, as do my colleagues, that the parliamentary system, and possibly <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself, is in danger in many countries today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to this House that this proposition is designed to safeguard <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation will stifle <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aspect of the Bill strikes at the very heart of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was one of concern not only to any Australian who believed in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but also to the Liberal Party because National Party candidates were contesting Liberal Party seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that in that secret way the whole of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being upset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remember him making in a rather amateurish and offensive way on free time on national television on Sunday night last an appeal to allow <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and fair play it is to be hoped that the Premier of New South Wales is given the opportunity to disseminate the truth and negate the spurious arguments of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, should not be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Violence is being done to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the Premiers of those free States are the last line of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its moves in endeavouring to control the activities of the Senate are a sacrilege, a contempt of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and indicative of its thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the very basis on which our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to that ‘Address to the Nation’ particularly because the Prime Minister called in aid his concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and his concept of what the Constitution of Australia required in the filling of this casual vacancy created by the elevation of  Mr Justice  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is so very easy for a person to use fancy words and to call in aid <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to justify whatever he does or whatever attitude he takes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is at work as fully and amply as one could expect under the Constitution of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it goes without saying that elections, in our concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, are the way in which people express their opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, by virtue of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia works in 2 ways in this process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot think of any better way in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country can work than by processes which are written expressly into the Constitution of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an empty accusation for the Prime Minister to say that what is proposed to be done by the Government of New South Wales does violence to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister were really concerned with industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, with rank and file control over trade union affairs, he could do nothing other than support these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is there in that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am as keen to see them having an expression of opinion as I am to see <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being promoted in any other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is an organisation of that kind, then one would think that the simple rules of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ought to prevail before those members can be amalgamated with another organisation into a new union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have yet to understand, let alone hear from the Minister, any good reason why the ordinary rules of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should not prevail in this situation, more particularly because so often we hear, and properly so, within the trade union movement in Australia the assertion that unionism is one of the most democratic organisations within Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really, as I have said, a denial of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the whole membership of the union concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him not speak in terms of violence to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when he does not present in proper context his own arguments in justification of his own action because, as I have said, in appointing the then  Senator Murphy  to the High Court the Prime Minister undoubtedly took every political advantage at his command, acting as he did with strict constitutional propriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that we believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, we believe in freedom of speech and we believe in the democratic institution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a good country and this is a good <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intercede very briefly to say first of all that this particular clause, in respect of which we have just had advocacy from that great champion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, is the one that gives complete autocratic authority to a man who is elected by the Parliament of the Commonwealth- not by the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like every other  speaker  on this side of the House whom I have heard, I believe that the criticisms made here are so damning, as are some of the comments made by members of the Government, that the proper course of action is to withdraw this Bill, have another go, then let us on this side of the House examine the proposals and let <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or do we believe in an agency of government being able to run riot, to disturb the economy and to disturb the free workings of a market economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my way of thinking that is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative of leaving the position as it is- is certainly a negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It clearly shows how the Government is prepared to hang on to office at any cost- even to the extent of raping <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On this most extraordinary of parliamentary occasions we are deliberating tonight in circumstances which every one of the members on this side of the House feels need to be sheeted home in terms of the manner of the public political execution which was perpetrated by the man who is Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in order not to enhance the status of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, certainly not to improve the quality or the standing of this House, nor the members of it; rather to destroy a man who has been his parliamentary colleague, a man of whom the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  said, as recorded in Hansard on 9 July 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy that the men who are presently in Government are neither prepared to maintain the conventions nor to uphold <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is none other than the Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony),  the principal saboteur of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia, a man who will go to any lengths to prevent us from having decent parliamentary elections where all people’s votes count equally and a man who at every question time in this House will use his capacity and his special position to break up question time so that no longer can there continue one of the important traditions of this Parliament, namely, that Ministers stand here and answer in the public place and be heard publicly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not hold it against him that he is one of the old boys of that redoubtable institution, the home of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and keen, rabid and radical spirits, the South Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When violence is done to an important convention , a well established custom, then violence is done to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is a lot more to it than that because the whole principle of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has been placed at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is vital that we should have a diversity of sources of information and opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is vital that the media should not be in the hands of a small number of rich and powerful men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do we need to act in terms of the beliefs and prejudices of the community from which we come but also we have to uphold the values of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to hold the state in check. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout those centuries, it is perfectly obvious, the whole practice, the standing orders of the Parliament, have been built upon the right of the public of Australia or any other country that has the Westminster system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to hear not only from the Government but also from the Opposition, for the Parliament is quite separate from the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will fight it and we will win because the parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of Australia is so well entrenched that we will and must win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament has before it a great challenge, and that challenge is to maintain the parliamentary system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for Australia or just to lie down and be raped like the spineless members of the Labor Party are prepared to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Parliament will become again what it ought to be, that is, the focal point of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Few men have done so much violence to the important conventions, to the well-established customs and hence to the <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as has this Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is fond of telling us that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> here, and the most dangerous parliamentary predator, has been shown to be the Prime Minister himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be supreme if it is to survive as the paramount manifestation of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and if our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself is to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as the Prime Minister keeps telling us, that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the democratic institutions are under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were the actions of a man who, I believe, has no respect for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and without regard for the conventions of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When violence is done to an important convention, a well established custom, then violence is done to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The violence  Mr Whitlam  thus did to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was the ultimate sin of this tragic morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uproar and incidents that provoked  Mr Cope  to announce his resignation from the Chair will be remembered as a shameful blot on the record of the Whitlam Government and on the reputation of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Aus.tralia …  Mr Whitlam  has engineered a frightening breach ofthe rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that honourable members have seen enough erosion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this Parliament caused by the actions of the Senate and that they do not wish to see any further denigration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every Australian knows that the blame for the deplorable deterioration of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that occurred here last Thursday rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister and those members of the Labor Party who accepted his ruthless dictation without question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, the last fortnight has been the most deplorable in the history of the Australian parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, if not in the history of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of Westminster system countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know what dictatorship is, but let me remind the House that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is balanced and shared power and opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This apparently is a reference to a speech entitled Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Democratic’ delivered by the present Minister for Labor and Immigration on 1 7 September 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-49-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia have been fortunate enough to be born in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been fortunate enough to be able to stand in this Parliament and argue matters of state because this is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a waste of time to talk <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when the people have never heard of it or, at least, they have never had a chance to practise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great tragedy for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that often governments act contrary to the opinion of the people they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every person in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should have his belief considered with respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do think that it is proper that in the debate on the motion for the third reading of the Bill I should, in a very generalised way, express my displeasure with this Bill and my view that anyone who believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ought to be ashamed of introducing this Bill in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They all want to talk about this splendid effort of the Australians who were so anxious to preserve freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and who were successful in that sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic objection to the principle embodied in this clause is that under our parliamentary systemnot necessarily those of the countries referred to by the Prime Minister, many of which have very different systems- which is the result of evolution and of hundreds of years of development of a representative system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Britain, members of Parliament remain individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very important thing to the people of this country and to the operation of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see that the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is served in any way by taking away from political parties the responsibility of getting their supporters out to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the essence of any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the capacity of a group of people with ideas and objectives to come together, without having to go through any kind of legal procedure, and to put forward ideas, to sponsor candidates for parliamentary elections and to get people to support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do this I do not think we will be serving the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; I think we will be hindering the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a person should not know who his candidate is and the party to which he belongs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the formalising of the existing party structure gives advantage to existing parties and makes it very difficult for new ones because it is completely against the representative parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that has been developed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we must do is encourage <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia and to encourage the development of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic point behind the argument I am putting is that it is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which is important in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind clause 21 seeks to tighten <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to restrict <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to develop a situation under the electoral laws of this country in which it will be more difficult for other than the established parties to contest electorates and it will be difficult to do anything to alter the political status quo in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Hume talks about the retention of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The retention of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in our community means that the most information that can possibly be conveyed to people on election day should be conveyed to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill- it will retain <span class="highlight">democracy</span> more than anything else- sets out to do just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an irresponsible candidate puts in his name flippantly or if some unscrupulous individual nominates candidates by the dozen, he can make <span class="highlight">democracy</span> impossible to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the overall picture, it does affect <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by the packing of ballot papers at a low cost, and in that way it defeats the real vote of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>On the surface the proposal to register parties might appear to have some attraction, but when it is subjected to a closer scrutiny extensive effects are revealed which impinge on elections in Australia for our representative parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor should provide the people with the same <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as it requires in its internal affairs- there should not be’ one law for the present Labor Government, which we might call the PLG, and another-for the people- but instead it is trying to entrench itself in government, on the pretext of making things simpler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If members of the Liberal Party, particularly those from the State of Victoria, have been reading the editorials that have been appearing in the newspapers over the past few weeks they would have seen that people who do not agree with the Australian Labor Party on many other issues believe that the virtues of the principle of one vote one value are still important in the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out so aptly by the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard),  the whole substance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is based upon the premise that if the people wish it they may change a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is divided power- a division of power around the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing no government or minister to have full and unfettered power is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, as I know and as every other honourable member knows, that we profess to live in a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential constituents, ingredients and characteristics of a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are certainty, continuity, a sense of responsibility not in the singular interests of a political party, not in the interests of the Parliament itself, but in the long term national interests of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its place he wants a trend more and more towards centralisation, more and more towards an autocratic system of government, and more and more towards the destruction of a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which is the very heart and soul of the Australian political system today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister also wishes to turn away from what I regard as two of the essential features of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such matters as the Racial Discrimination Bill, the attempts to gerrymander the electorate in order to sustain an authoritarian system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; and various Constitution Bills that were knocked back by the Senate and the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable members who are trying to interject obviously do not believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that the people in the electorate who cast any sort of a vote count for much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always preach true <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but seize power as fast and ruthlessly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I stand here as one who believes in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, who wants it to be successful, who wants this country to be effectively governed no matter who may be in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does mean that the proceedings of this House have been less demeaning to the reputation of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people appointed to it must be prepared to work hard and long to ensure that the impetus gained in establishing the site for the new house is not lost, and that the Australian nation can look forward to a building which reflects its national pride and the paramount importance we attach to the role and traditions of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a government led by a Prime Minister without respect for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or the conventions of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-129-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great virtues of a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the Press has the right to try to obtain information and to print that information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results of the elections, particularly for the Upper House, indicated that optional preferential voting is a very effective method of giving <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a real way to all people in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to the optional preferential system real <span class="highlight">democracy</span> prevails in South Australia as far as the election of members to the Upper House is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a goal for which we all are striving- a permanent Parliament House to serve parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To add more fuel to the fire the Sydney  Daily Telegraph,  that great old organ of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, has published a similar article. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a very important principle in our parliamentary representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that individuals have the right to stand and have the chance of being elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen too often in the past that where Parliament has lost control of its armed forces the capacity of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to survive has been questioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a most important part of our parliamentary representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time that the Government went back to a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and allowed proper consideration of these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like our system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and federalism, our economic system has imperfections but it is still the system we will have until a better system evolves or otherwise commends itself to the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Today is 27 August 1975, the day that honourable members in this House and elsewhere and the people of Australia- in particular the people of Queensland- could well take note of because today <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was pack raped in the Queensland Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow me to take honourable members some time back into the past to indicate the way in which, as I have said, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has been pack raped today in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that all honourable members take note of this serious situation, because it is true to say that today in Queensland <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was pack raped and the people of Queensland, in fact the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any system in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will fail if you set out to undermine it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all remember seeing the Prime Minister one night on television declaiming with all the artificial statesmanship he could command that when violence is done to an important convention, a well established custom, then violence is done to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia  (Mr Anthony)  has moved an amendment to paragraph (3) because this paragraph in its present form is mischievous and is designed not to have a debate on <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but to have a debate on party politics in the hope that the Labor Government can pick up a little ground in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Courier-Mail,  that well known organ of support of the misguided <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Queensland, had this to say today: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of those members who came here in the group elected to the House of Representatives in 1974, it seems appropriate to look at some of the responsibilities that we have if we believe in upholding the role of Parliament and if we believe in selling ourselves and selling our system continuously to the community as being the best system that yet has been devised as a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, observing the ways in which we are carrying out those duties, whether we are doing those duties successfully and whether the criticisms of parliaments and the inadequacies of our parliaments are the legitimate aim of people outside the Parliament who criticise the actions that we take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He failed to do the one thing really within his power- a simple statement that the basic principle he has again and again acknowledged shall apply, a simple statement that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will not again be falsified as was attempted in 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to these political difficulties, unprecedented in Australia, unparalleled in any comparable <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I retreat in no degree from our full responsibilities as the elected, the re-elected Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle is that in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the elected representatives of the people govern the country and when they refuse to do so they lose their right to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are seriously to place parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the hands of elected members of Parliament we should certainly give them better accommodation, not sharing rooms two and three to a room, interrupting each other by way of telephone calls, interviews and other things, with inefficient systems of work and a lack of staff support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that I wish to make is that if they continue to pursue that course, their action will endanger very greatly the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia as we know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said at that time, and I repeat it, that the Governor-General should have dismissed both the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the then Attorney-General, former  Senator Murphy,  from their positions because they had so contravened the Constitution that their actions set at nought the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> about which in this debate Government members have been speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That happening, brought on by the express will of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  was something that has created an irritant among people who have seen their fortress of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that it should pass the notice of honourable members that since the estimates for the Parliament were last debated in October of last year the largest functioning parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world has ceased to exist as a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that it ought to serve as a salutary lesson for all of us, irrespective of our partisan feelings, that the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> throughout the world is limited to a very few countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude my remarks by again saying that the institution of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> throughout the world is in a fairly fragile state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We cannot write rules that will preserve parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A couple of members from the Government side tonight spoke of the future of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>i think it was the member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  who said that we do not have <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He blames areas outside this place for the failure of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as we are concerned we look straight at this place in relation to the future of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Diamond Valley was also concerned about the future of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in my mind and it is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the people’s mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion was made that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was being thrown out the window as a result of certain decisions made in Queensland last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will conclude on this note: I think that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is founded upon the free availability of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the operations of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depended upon information being freely available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse the words spoken this morning by the Minister for the Media who said that the functioning of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depended on the free availability of information, and the functioning of this House depends upon members having proper information and access to the information that the Government has in its possession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition thereby is frustrating the proper processes of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, I am inclined to take the view that we have turned over to the Aboriginal people probably an excess degree of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in regard to housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to examine some of the actions of our present Government and to compare them with their basis of power and their role as fitting within the context of a constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that these are most serious circumstances for the operation of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the story when we look at a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite members of the Committee to turn to Jefferson or to any of the greats of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government is not a matter of decree; <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not a matter of decree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country that they should be given effect by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speech just given by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  purporting to advance the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ill relates to the substance of the matter for which he seeks to suspend Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To extend that and to say that it is a matter of advancing the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is even more nonsensical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are designed to weaken significantly the voice of country areas and to change significantly the balance of electoral boundaries within Australia, not to the advantage of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but to the advantage of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are not being introduced to advance the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, a redistribution is urgently required because of the demands of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have the typical demonstration, as we have had on other occasions and I suspect again today, by the Leader of the House of his own desire to introduce the legislation irrespective of attitudes or of quality of debate in this place it will demonstrate what little time the Government Party has for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, what little time it has for the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bills and now they get up and say parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who can say that there is any semblance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that kind of difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real meaning of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must surely be one vote one value, or one vote of one citizen equal to the value of the vote of another citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are proposals which the Minister for Services and Property brings into this House, with a mask of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to hide their real face- the face of injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is possible to get the sort of result which was achieved in 1974 in the Senate, which was in contradiction of the popular election of a Labor government in this Houseaggravated by the appointment of 2 independent people to the Senate in  Senator Bunton  and  Senator Field-  we are going to have to look outside the Parliament for someone to determine what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet Opposition members stand up on behalf of the coalition Opposition Parties and say what they would do to introduce and consolidate <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the National Country Party and the Liberal Party continue in their operations in regard to the Constitution and in their opposition to electoral reform and in the manner they have conducted themselves over the last year there is a fair chance that the processes of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia as we know them in this Parliament will not survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that intrigued me most about the speech of the honourable member for Port Adelaide- particularly in view of the eloquent tributes to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> paid by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)-  was his reference to the result of the last Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One look at the situation in Queensland, where the State Country Party leader whom I suppose we could call the bastion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rules with 20 per cent of the vote, shows what the Country Party philosophy really is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party believes in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> will be unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the representatives of the people have a voice in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that that is an absolute desecration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody who believes in substantial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> could ever argue otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He or she does not know where the responsibility lies, and this is bad for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think there is a very real threat to our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is under a threat, our way of life is under threat, if we consistently turn our backs on precedents, conventions and traditions that have served us well since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political instability that is being fostered in Australia by the actions of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-  the man who is afraid to face up to a debate in this place, the man who dodges our Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in this national forum, the man who expresses his views only through Press handouts and not here in the national Parliament- is a tragedy for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an essential ingredient of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, particularly a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which has become a multi-racial society, that migrant groups should not only be able to communicate among themselves but have the means to tell us of their, problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think the House ought to remember that the legal profession does have experience in the provision of legal aid services and must play a very substantial role in any system devised for the provision of legal aid, because however much people may take sideswipes at the legal profession the fact is that an independent legal profession is an important safeguard of individual rights in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a basic element in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it suits honourable members opposite they are the people who claim to be the espousers of sound constitutional principle and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That bastion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the Legislative Council in South Australia, which introduced for the first time at the last State elections a decent system of voting, has now adopted optional preferential voting by which one can vote for one’s own team and can then vote for all the other teams in order of preference, if one wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is it worth considering in terms of the national effort and the system that we have set up in order to try to create the fairest possible parliamentary representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why Australia has probably the most outmoded and most complicated electoral laws of any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is really saying this: ‘We are all in favour of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as long as we can control it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is supposed to be guided <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been the situation not only in every English speaking <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but also in every other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would permit a situation where an upper House could reject a Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In no other parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has the elected government been subject to the artificial pressures and intolerable stress to which this Government has been subject by the unconstitutional threat of an election every 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite can argue about the merits of taxation and whether company tax should be 216 per cent higher or lower but that is somewhat irrelevant to the basic issue of whether we have continuity of government and continuity of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is one thing that is fundamental in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in our system of British justice, in our understanding of the common law rights of the citizen, it is that each citizen not only should have the opportunity to receive the services of the law but also should have the right to obtain the services of the lawyer of his choice, who is independent of everyone- government and individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each and every one of us must remember that the most vital and important functions that we have to fulfil in this place are our responsibility to the electorate, to the people who are our masters- that was said in the  recent election- to the government of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to make sure that we do nothing to lower the standards of this House, the responsibility of this House and the progress of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is trying to overturn the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because he wants to be a kind of glorified  president. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important things about the Parliament and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that there should be a strong and effective Opposition but if there is one thing we will not have in this Parliament it is a strong and effective Opposition whilst Opposition members pursue the line they have taken today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Graft in politics will bring down people’s <span class="highlight">democracy</span> more rapidly than anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something happened in Australia recently that strikes at the very roots of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The swinging seats are the cradle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> without which there can be no change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A lot has been said over the months about the events prior to and on 1 1 November during a period when fundamental constitutional conventions which form the very framework of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> were broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will tell him that the issues are far greater than he imagines and that I still believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be brought back to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am overjoyed to see in the Governor-General’s Speech that measures are being taken to restore <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All the talk in the world about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will not make the Parliament or the country democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You participated in a conspiracy against our system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You represent, at the Opening of Parliament, an interpretation of the Constitution which threatens Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Her  Majesty has seen fit to say in her letter to  Mr Speaker  Scholes, that she has no responsibility for your actions, and as you have asserted your power to remove and appoint Ministers at will, there has been created in Australia a position where an appointed person governs, answerable to no-one, not to the Ministers whom he appoints and removes at will, not to the Parliament which he dissolves at will, nor to the Queen who asserts ‘that it would not be proper for her to intervene ‘, to comply with your summons to attend in the Senate on Tuesday, ratifies your actions and places Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in further peril by inviting future incumbents of your Office to invoke the precedent you have established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the centralised policies, so called, of the Labor Government were as dangerous to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the system as is said by honourable members opposite will be debated at great length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who can blame the people of Batman for believing that the present Liberal-Country Party Government provides a huge threat to them in particular and to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in general? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its purpose is to work for the people to create an Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government owes its existence to the most sustained and savage attack on established principles of Australian parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ever perpetuated in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manner in which the dissolution of the last Parliament was brought about, the promises and policies put to the people, and the subsequent evidence of the true nature of this Government are all related issues, all linked, all part of the one great issue- the quality of our political life, the future strength and survival of our political institutions, the nature of our Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world could a  president  or a head of state dismiss an elected government with half of its term to serve, a Prime Minister and a Government with a secure majority in the People’s House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that central fact is grasped, until we bend our minds and wills to righting that wrong, we will remain, whatever our prosperity or progress, a second-rate <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am honestly and firmly of the opinion that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia suffered a great blow with the events of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, after all, is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when people are prevented from voting that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a move- using the word ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ in its broadest sense- amongst any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for people no matter where they be situated, to feel that they have the power to enter into the decision making process of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The forces of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> dictate, I think historically at this point, that the people wish and require to become part of the decision making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thought that is ingrained in the GovernorGeneral ‘s Speech is the preservation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir John  Kerr will be remembered long after the ghosts of the Labor Party because he was a lover of freedom, a defender and upholder of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, a man who not only believed in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but who knew that once you limit it you virtually lose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That demonstrates complete disregard for the conventions of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that the former Minister was party not only to a breach of the Constitution but also to a breach in our electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our unqualified policy to restore government in Australia to a role consistent with freedom, with true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and as one which values each person in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They continue to expand their views on <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether they would like Australia to have the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which operates in Iraq. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> took a step backwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From now on political scientists and keen students of political history will confer two meanings on Remembrance Day, Firstly, it will be the day when the fallen of two world wars will be remembered; secondly, it will be remembered as the day when part of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people who try to portray themselves as the great respecters of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and democratic institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, sooner or later, electoral reform must be passed to ensure that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> does reign in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there is no other alternative than to ask that the United States Congress itself investigate the activities of the CIA in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said by many that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia was born in the 1850s at the Eureka Stockade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The events of the last 4 months have done violence to every concept of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every constitutional convention by which parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can function has been broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Governor-General did on Remembrance Day will go down in history as one of the greatest travesties on political law, on <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, that has ever been witnessed in this country, because if the Governor-General of this country is to be given the right, under the powers of the royal prerogative, to sack any government that he chooses, as he did on this occasion, no government could survive in a time of economic crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do say that the continuance of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it now, as we have known it for a number of years and as people in Britain have known it for many years, depends on what the average person believes the position to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not time in the few minutes at my disposal to expand on all his powers but I believe that they are a threat to Australian parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would that behaviour be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> could the first law officer authorise such activities and deny the Parliament any convincing explanation for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than 300 people were detained following middle of the night raids in Gestapo style, and this occurred under the leadership of that great advocate of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> who has just been before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot uphold <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country if you want to dictate to the police what they should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also raises the question of the rights of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to prevail without the intrusion by individuals who are not elected by the people of this country and to protect the rights of parliamentarians to carry out their obligations to the people who elect them without interference from the Commonwealth police or any other organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would hardly be impressed by the recent exhibition of this jackboot <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the implication and the interpretation, and if we are not able then to take issue with the AttorneyGeneral, I believe that, because of the manner in which people expect the Attorney-General to act, parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservative coalition in the Senate frustrated these attempts to bolster the basis of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I could not altogether agree with him when he said that  Mr Daly  was deliberately endeavouring to ensure that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was working to the full, that every man and woman was entitled to a vote, and all these sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed this legacy of bitterness, which is the price of the coalition victory, has disturbing implications for the future of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is more than likely to be the type of society we are headed for unless the coalition parties show to the people that they really do believe in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and are prepared to conduct themselves in a fair and principled fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to them that if they wish to have a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country then the means of achieving power is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they play a ruthless game of achieving and keeping power at any price, there is no doubt that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will not survive in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such action is itself a repudiation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government’s answer to that is not concession but more repression, then the vicious circle of repression, reaction and further repression will quickly demolish any semblance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they really want to preserve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> then they may well have to revise their ideas of acceptable political behaviour in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the alternative is likely to be the eventual destruction of any semblance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to risk losing in one severe and sudden transfer of power everything that they tried so desperately to retain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major concerns of this Government is to enhance the quality of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is essentially a process for taking decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a modern representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is a process that demands popular control over the people’s representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a third area in which the quality of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> needs strengthening- the functioning of this Parliament itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Committees is dealing with important matters which affect the fundamental working of this institution of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to add,  Mr Speaker,  that I believe that if this report is as good as I would hope, as good as this Parliament has a right to expect, it will initiate, or enable to be initiated, some fundamental changes in the workings of this Parliament which will be of lasting and permanent value to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and make this institution function much better over the next 76 years than it has over the last 76 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about things like liberty, justice, <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, equality of opportunity and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General, in his Speech, placed great emphasis on the needs of the individual and the importance of the individual in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important lesson is that democratically elected governments are the servants of the people and that the  individual is the most important element in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its purpose is to work with the people to create an Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is stupid for anyone to talk about political <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this place, particularly someone who adopts the point of view of ex-trade union secretaries from States like mine, and the honourable member for Port Adelaide should damned well recognise the fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is part of the countervailing system in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that Ministers who are arms of the Parliament have adequate resources at their disposal for influence, for study and all the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We accept that performance sometimes falls  short  of the aim, but believe the existence of a healthy and independent ABC is of central importance to maintaining and building an Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament becomes unworkable by destruction of convention, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself becomes unworkable because <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rests much more on adherence to convention than to the rigid application of rules and laws . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself- the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the rights and privileges of minorities- Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the same way as this Government has passed over any formal indication of concern for the dismantling of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> over which it presided last year, it is now overlooking and disregarding issues which my colleagues and I have raised as democrats and as people very concerned about proper representation in this House and responsiveness to this representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A lot of people have lost confidence in the people’s <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country following the events of late last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are urging that there be an amendment of the Constitution to give support to what was obviously intended in section 53, that unless this is the House of pre-eminence, the House of the people, the House where taxes are raised, we will not have <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to return to a position consistent with that described by Professor Sawer, a position which promised and conferred certainty and stability on the workings of the Parliament, vigorous remedial action is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a perversion of the very nature of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the elected representatives of the people can be hamstrung in their task of government by just those men that the people have rejected as potential administrators of the nation ‘s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the task of erasing this black mark of shame against Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> falls to other quarters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party and the Labor movement together will do their part to make the Australian people truly aware of how the calculated actions of the conservative parties last November have seriously endangered the effective operation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Party members of Parliament and our supporters must keep hammering the fact that when a Labor Government or most Labor men use the words ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ and ‘peace’ they have an entirely different meaning from the meaning which the vast majority of Australians believe them to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The word ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ to Labor has a similar meaning to that given it by the communists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor’s definition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a situation in which if anyone disagrees with it they will be dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Journalists say that they support freedoms, but the sincerity of their statements must be questioned because of the obvious sympathy of many of them with communist regimes around the world, regimes which practise all the complete antitheses of democracymurder, deceit and class hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose what really irritates me most- I guess we on the Government side are becoming slightly sick of it- is the Opposition’s constant talk about representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being killed and its constant denigration of the Governor-. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The stark fact is that a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> anywhere is a system which requires tolerance on the part of those operating it if it is to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing that the Government says again at an election will ever be believed by those people who on this occasion were silly enough to believe that when the Government said it believed in democratic control of trade unions it did believe in it, because the reintroduction of the collegiate system proves beyond all doubt that it does not believe in union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that the history of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> over the last five or six hundred years in the countries that speak the English language or the French language has proved that that statement historically is utterly wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has survived in circumstances of conflict, where in the United Kingdom a king had his head chopped off and in the United States of America, as it became on the North American continent, colonists were prepared to rise in rebellion and establish themselves as people prepared to operate the parliamentary system as they saw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is important in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but it is not necessarily absolute because deficit financing will obviously also be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not accept that an arrangement born in deceit, an arrangement which broke every tradition, every convention, every rule of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- an arrangement which may well have damaged our institutions and weakened our social fabric for generations to come- can be described as a gentlemen’s agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The clear and dangerous threat to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, law and order posed by public statements inciting mass action outside the parliamentary process is a matter which we as patriotic Australians would ignore only at our national peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House then will draw the conclusion I urge upon it, that is, that the making of statements along the lines of those reported and attributed to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition are matters which no Parliament could ever ignore if it believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not matter whether there is a Liberal government or a Labor government in office, if any group in the community is going to challenge the authority of the Parliament <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is on the way out and totalitarian dictatorship is on the way in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forces outside Parliament had to be active if <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that Parliament was a very important section of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but if we are to make <span class="highlight">democracy</span> function we have to be alert at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is also under threat in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that in totalitarian countries the restraints upon the use of military power by the leaders of those countries are far less than they are in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because those leaders are not subject to the constraints of public opinion or to having someone come down the road, knock on the door and say to their local member: ‘We do not like what you are doing about sending our kids to Vietnam’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Parliament is the subject and the servant of the people, and until the Labor Party tries to make the system work more efficiently, until all groups in this community co-operate and realise the need to support the Parliament, we will get far less support in this country for real <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I am not so sure that the Labor Party is even concerned with proper <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Essentially this debate represents an alternative view of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> really is and I think that alternative view is a very important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is participation by the people in whatever they can in the government of themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is not simply dropping a ballot paper into the box once every 3 years and doing nothing but listening to radio, watching television and reading newspapers until the next time you vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that a definition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is not passive consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is active participation in every conceivable way that a person can and there is little enough that a person can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is doing whatever you can when you can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is writing letters to the newspapers, attending meetings, going to demonstrations, taking part in marches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course these things are <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and unless you people opposite realise the significance of participation you miss the meaning of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> completely and constantly you miss the meaning of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> except for your own kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House know far more about what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is and we know far more the harm that violence does- the violence that the people opposite have stood for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst other things, it will not only take decision-making power closer to the people, but more importantly it will entrench guarantees that protect the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the right of the Australian citizen to have a say in the way in which his country is governed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to continue and a federal system is to last it is very important that each sovereign level of government have the capacity to raise through its own efforts a large proportion of the revenue required to fund its expenditure obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Perth  (Mr McLean)  on his support for Polish <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and Polish independence just as enthusiastically as I condemn the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  for quoting last evening an editorial written by Father Wilkinson, the editor of the Adelaide  Southern Cross. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survival of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends on an urgent reaffirmation of the great conventions which provided the framework of constitutional government in this country, conventions struck down by the conservative forces in their pursuit of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia is not to become a second rate <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, these conventions must be reaffirmed and given constitutional protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through these programs and our regionalism concept we, in office, were developing participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country- not centralism in Canberra or the State capitals, which in fact has been so much the case for so long, but government by the people and for the people at the local government and grass roots levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will give you participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very first speeches that we heard in the Parliament about the question of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> within the trade union movement from the Government were a condemnation of the Australian Labor Party’s federal policy of ‘participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s platform goes on to outlaw the collegiate system on the basis that it conflicts with and violates the principle of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very hard to reconcile the conflicting views of anybody who is elected to Parliament, as honourable members opposite have been elected, on the promise of introducing or strengthening the principle of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to give the rank and file the right to control their own union officials, and who then defends the collegiate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very nice to talk about the rank and file, grass roots <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and things like that but we have the same kind of situation as we have in the election of the Senate, something which my honourable friends on the other side are so keen on condemning as not really being the House of the people at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is calling grass roots <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is really a kind of phony, mass hysteria or mass organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, the collegiate system of voting is not negatory of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will also seek to further our own deeply held values of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, freedom and respect for the individual at every opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe in participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade union affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is more, I was successful in piloting through the House of Representatives Bills which gave legislative force to all these basic principles of union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the issue of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- of our whole way of life as we have evolved it over generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said earlier that political strikes not only usurp the rights and responsibilities of individual trade union members, they also put <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Don Dunstan and Neville Wran proved that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> works better by consensus than by one-man dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the real hope of this Parliament, this Government and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as a whole lies in the decentralisation of power and in getting power back to the grass roots level of the people who have a real understanding of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, none of what was said then has come true, and I think the Australian people now realise that rape of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which took place last November in the name of economic sanity was a furphy and that all they are getting out of it is growing unemployment and a level of inflation which is higher than they could have expected under a Labor administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget shows the total corruption and the absolute lack of initiative or leadership in the people who perverted Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cop this one- Jack Mundey, the communist, the one who is the friend of the Australian people, the one who stands for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This group is so concerned about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that it has sought to call a public meeting to quell the flames of 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is certainly rotten inasmuch as it would seek to give support to rabble rousers and to those who would like to see <span class="highlight">democracy</span> destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has come for the Australian people to make a stand on behalf of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to tell the rabble rousers on the Opposition benches that they do not want any more of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is time that the Australian people spoke up and said: ‘We do believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Included in the Maude report was a conclusion that:  if as a nation we want Local <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the National Government must give Local Authorities a larger measure of home rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other philosophical comment I make is against the background that honourable members on the other side of the House claim that they know what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many Australians are unaware of the reasons that led the Chilean people- a people who throughout the years have become an example of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and stability in South America- to finally rid themselves of a Marxist regime that had brought this once happy country to the brink of total disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that the Labor Party supports such a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where the individual has no right to choose for himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the basis of representation in the party which is here is an excrescence in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in terms of numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition has moved an amendment which seeks a reduction in the appropriation for the Senate because the Opposition believes that what happened, particularly from the presentation of the Budget in 1975 until 1 1 November 1975, almost spelt the death knell of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is whittled away the door will be open for the manipulation of criminal proceedings by the bureaucracy whose regard for the rights of the individual and the rule of law may, by the mere development of that bureaucratic system, end up being less than that which we have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I appeal to all the goodwill of the people of Australia, to our historical past and to people in this House- I know there are many who believe that what I am saying here this morning is correct- to stop appeasing dictators and oppressors and try to demand that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  stand up and speak up for what all Australians believe in: Liberty, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and free expression of free peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been mentioned, he had a very deep commitment to the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and individual freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet one must recognise, if we want to maintain the liberal type of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which most of us have experienced and enjoyed, that there must be an allowance, a tolerance, for the dissemination of views to which one takes exception … <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was made clear by President Thieu that he did not agree with the concept and it was uncertain whether there was to be a presidential election or a provincial election, and the basic details as to what sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was to be established were never discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to anybody who seeks to justify in 1976 the argument that a Governor-General in Australia can exercise powers which the Queen in the United Kingdom cannot that his synthetic sympathy about what is happening in Hungary or anywhere else in the world is very misplaced when he is taking part in the death of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He spoke about the occasion of 11 November as a day of infamy- the death of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- going back to colonial days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This indicates that he does not know what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in 20 years’ time can remember the events of 1 1 November and say that that was the day that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> died in Australia, he really does not know history and for once has has actually given away completely recognition of the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To give you some examples of how this National Civic Council-dominated college denigrates <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I would set out the following facts: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been revealed as being much more concerned about protecting ultra right wing groups in key unions and saving employer organisations the embarrassment of direct voting for their officials than it has been about ensuring that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> prevails in the election of officers of organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They need to be able to do this in a structure of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> without fear of intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the proposals that the Minister has encompassed in it will play a great part in restoring <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the trade union movement of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a good choice and it shows how <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can work and produce excellent results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that that is not the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which should be introduced into trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The so-called secret ballot amendments passed by this Parliament were not intended by the Government benches actually to provide union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only aspect of union elections that it has affected is that of direct <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a system of direct <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the various groups within the union will usually have more representation amongst the office bearers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope we never get to the stage that instead of saying that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia is as dead as a dodo we say that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia is as dead as a dingo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obiously it would mean that if that action was to be continued we could not look forward to a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 11 November 1975, the Governor-General of this country carried out such a breach of constitutional propriety, supported by the people who are now on the other side of this House and in particular by those who were sworn in as Ministers, that their actions offer a threat to the continuance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These facets of our political life are offensive to everything for which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The oddest situation has been created in which what was called by Lord Bryson in 1911 ‘the most advanced <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ has become a potential for one man dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second approach is to review the events of that day in the light of their constitutional significance, to consider their implications for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for the future stability of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a parody of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to assert that a govenment must be responsible to a chamber elected on a grossly unequal system of representation; a chamber whose numbers can be varied, and have indeed been varied, by State Premiers without regard to the electors’ will; whose members at some times have been chosen 3 years or 6 years before the members of this House, and who can bring about an election for the House of Representatives without having to face an election themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So on this Remembrance Day we lament 2 things: The damage to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> caused by the Liberals in opposition, and the damage to our nation caused by the Liberals in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me make it very clear that from the point of view of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Whitlam Government was denied its democratic right to remain in office for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Sydney this afternoon they will be discussing what happened on 1 1 November last and how is it that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a government could be so denied the opportunity to govern by one man? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can <span class="highlight">democracy</span> survive in this country if we have a Senate so devoid of an appreciation of its responsibilities and so subservient to party rule and party discipline that the decisions of Government senators were made not in the Senate but in their party room? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This brings the monarchy into disrepute and affects the whole concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> meant that the House of the people could rule and govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s prerogative powers, powers which are essential to the preservation of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, are the safety valve that ensures that in times of crisis it is the people exercising the ultimate right in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> who have a say in determining the future of their government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the pretext on which the rules and traditions of centuries of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> were overturned in November last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in the face of that situation and considering that the business of the Parliament is being run as it has been done since the Parliament commenced in 1901 without any significant changes, we will run out of the capacity to provide for effective parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> this means that when the Parliament appropriates monies, in this case many millions of dollars, there should be no doubt as to what it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Constitution of this country, like the practice and customs of every other parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world, treats the Parliament as absolutely supreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to applaud the actions of the Citizens for <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> in urging that meetings be held throughout Australia with a view to having a new constitution- a constitution approved by the people in the first instance and submitted to this Parliament just for mere technical legal ratification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, I believe that the referendum proposals will at long last bring <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into constitutional reform by giving the right to vote to over 300 000 Australians who happen to live in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think most fairminded and decent people believed that the action taken was a prostitution of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I agree with some of the comments in the newspapers and the media that there is a certain hypocrisy and cynicism in the Government’s actions now, at least the Government has seen the light The Constitutional Convention saw the light and the Liberal and National Country Parties now agree that in the long-term interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the nation the change is admirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this measure was debated in the Senate last night one of the more fearlessly honest members of the conservative parties,  Senator Wood,  said that he did not believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, he believed that we ought to have tribunes who stand up in the Parliament and represent industries or production figures or something like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet Opposition supporters have the audacity to stand up here this afternoon and this evening, and in the Senate yesterday afternoon and yesterday evening, and put forward token opposition by saying that this 7 year clause is precluding the workings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was his idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That shows that in the Liberal and National Country parties <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has a very good chance of working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is the form of government in which the free are rulers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is the healthful life-blood which circulates through the veins and arteries, which supports the system, but which ought never to appear externally, and as the mere blood itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to put on record the situation which applies in relation to quotas so that people who may not know the situation as it applies to Tasmania will not run away with the idea that we are one section of Australia which is receiving special favoured treatment which makes a mockery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every instance in which we have attempted to bring more complete <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to this Parliament and to the parliaments of Australia, we have been faced with the hot tempered opposition of honourable members on the other side of the House, particularly members of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we come to the question of electoral boundaries, I believe that a proper <span class="highlight">democracy</span> means that the electorates must be as equal as possible in voting strength and there is no practical difficulty whatsoever in doing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously it is unthinkable that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we should not put into our legislation the basic steps by which the democratic process will come into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because we have an appointed official who answers to no one and may do what he will with this Parliament, as he did the other week when he prorogued it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I never cease to wonder,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  at the irony of the situation in which the ragged and mouldy remnants of this Party childishly and gibberishly cried ‘havoc’, ‘get rid of Kerr’, ‘Kerr has destroyed <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all this is true then hundreds of thousands of workers and others who could not get to the ballot box quick enough to flush out these people who had riddled our great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must have been involved in that conspiracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have nowadays is the political and economic expression of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> with everyone having a say, which is good; everyone having restrictions removed, which is good; everyone being able to promote his own interests, which is good until those interests clash as greatly as they have in past times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot say that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the same in all of those countries which profess to be democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> varies from country to country and that the people in those countries have their own interpretations of how they want it applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before anybody jumps in and asks what Australians were doing becoming involved in the internal affairs of another country, let me say that I as an Australian, see nothing wrong in playing a pan, even if it is a small part, in one of the great exercises of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world- namely, the United States presidential election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other events have made it plain that the Labor Party’s proposal was merely the window dressing of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We cannot talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country unless we give some consideration to what representation means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If notice is not taken of the disadvantages suffered by country people in regard to access to their members of Parliament and if notice is not taken of the way in which members of Parliament have to go around to represent them, there is no justice, and justice and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> cannot be brought into this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have modelled ours upon is one of a mixture derived from fierce and bloody struggle, peaceful development, and evolution over several centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a truism mouthed by honourable members opposite that a monopoly of oil, in terms of distribution and marketing, in the hands of such cartels does not square at all with the principles of so-called competitive free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is little evidence that the size of families can readily be manipulated by the Government of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to achieve specific population goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these are laudable objectives in a contemporary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but I doubt whether this Government understands the terms it uses in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Her  quiet dignity and charm as the upholder of tradition and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> surely must have left a lasting impression on the majority of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This process must be based on participative industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the acknowledgment of the current and developing comparative advantages of Australia against its international competitors- in potential scales of production, the selective application of limited research facilities to the greatest effect, the natural endowments of physical resources and the educational level and social structure of our work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the basic rights and freedoms of the individual citizens in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure we realised just how proud we were to be part of this Parliament and part of a nation that can live and work in the freedom that is this <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It raises this serious question of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia: Does the Chief Justice really think now that he will be able to get a majority of the High Court to overturn the relatively recent earlier decision in the case of The State of Western Australia v.

  <li>
    <p>You will not get anything that has any value for this country, that will in any way contribute to the strength of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia, that will in any way contribute to the progress and development of this country or that we, who serve in this place-here I give credit to the Opposition as well- want to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore (and as we live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and because doubtless you would agree that taxpayers deserve to know who votes for what) we propose to print in our journal soon the names and the electorates of those who do not rigorously oppose this unfair retrospectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we do not allow the matter to go to the court, there will always be the stigma that the Parliament was used to protect a member of the Government, and that is not in the interests of good <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or good government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anyone can think that socialism is anything but a controlled economy of the kind which the honourable member and his friend the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G.

    <p>In the latter year it did what to my mind was the graveyard of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that a place other than this gained ascendency in regard to where the financial decisions of his nation are made, and the Government betrayed any respect that it may now claim for trying to defend things in terms of decent constitutional usage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as ours- this is often overlooked- having a large and viable Reserve Force working in cooperation with the Regular Forces establishes an essential link, which is important in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, between the Regular Forces and the Reserve Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, from the point of view of the principles of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about, we are faced with the position that if we were to oppose it to the extent of defeating it we could not possibly give anybody a vote on a division basis within a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister communicated with the South Australian Premier in such a way as would justify the Premier claiming in the South Australian Parliament yesterday that the Federal Minister for Productivity is so favourably impressed with the industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> policy of the South Australian Government that the Premier had had a request from the Federal Minister that the Federal Minister should address a world conference on industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being organised by the South Australian government to be held in that State at the end of May? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the South Australian Minister has said, there is a strong common element between the policies of the two major parties in respect of so-called industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, employee participation and so forth and in practice the South Australian Branch of the Department of Productivity and the South Australian Department of Labour and Industry have worked together very closely in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Minister who wants to get on under this socalled parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has to be a cringing, crawling cur to the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a parody of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we, the members of the Parliament itself, allow somebody outside the Parliament to fix our Speaker’s salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has put words into the mouth of the Governor-General which tend to convey the impression that the Government wants <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But that is one of the great problems of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Opposition tries to turn <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on its head and say how undemocratic it is to give the people of Australia a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is an attack on <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is the first time that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has ever been threatened by giving the people the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to deal with this concept of worker participation, or industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as it is sometimes called, and point out some of the fallacies, the traps and the advantages of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it is often a misunderstood concept, because when people think of phrases such as ‘worker participation’ or ‘industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ they often have different things in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that in many people’s minds this is the thing that really comes to the forefront when the term ‘worker participation’ or ‘industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ is used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are really talking about when we talk of worker participation and industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the third stream of thought that I want to raise, and that is the real involvement in the organisation of work and the decision making by employees throughout the whole structure of industry and commerce starting from the factory floor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed if I might say, without being impertinent, having been in the House for only four days but having studied its proceedings for a lifetime, it seems only too apparent to me that the traditions and customs of this House require a drastic overhaul if we are to serve the nation that we represent and the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we profess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nineteenth century philosophers feared that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would bring with it the politics of greed, that is, the buying of votes by the crudest and most vulgar promises of individual material reward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that this momentum will be kept up so that this Parliament, and in particular this chamber, can become once again a properly functioning chamber, so that we can have independence and so that we can have the strength that is meant to be ours in the parliamentary system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had he not acted as he did, had he not prevented the unconstitutional designs of the last Government being consummated, the shape of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would have been twisted and distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It said that not only is it proper that there should be State aid for political parties, but that the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we know is very much dependent on the role of political parties and that if the role of political parties and those people in them can be enhanced by State aid to political parties, such action is of benefit to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 The Committee was set up by the Government in May 1975, with the following terms of reference: ‘To consider whether, in the interests of Parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, provision should be made from public funds to assist political parties in carrying out their functions outside Parliament; to examine the practice of other Parliamentary democracies in this field, and to make recommendations as to the scope of political activities to which any such provision should relate and the method of its allocation. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is one of the elements of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that that is one of the risks we have to take when we stand for public office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the argument that  Mr Fairbairn  puts is very important because it gives the reaction to terrorism in democracies by people who believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and democracies should behave in a certain way when they are dealing with terrorism or attempted terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The saying of our time- ‘one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter’- is altogether pernicious so far as a constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that is not necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who engage in politically motivated violence in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are criminals and they should be regarded as such- and therefore the Army should never, never, never be brought out to deal with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, it is absolutely necessary to realise what the terrorist (a criminal in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I must repeat) is really after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The terrorists can never win in a constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, provided that the leaders of democracies stick to their lastthat is, behave according to the democratic mode of behaviour Never break its unspoken rules themselves and treat terrorists as criminals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is up to us to emphasise that we are living in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, that we are living in a constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that people who take violent means to try to change the <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- and we have no evidence that in fact that was the purpose of the bombing outside the Hilton, but let us assume it was- should be dealt with as common criminals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As various speakers from this side of the House have said in the course of this debate, there are many ways in which the Government has debauched the parliamentary process and the processes of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these factors amount to immense debauchery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say to members of the Liberal and National Country Parties that if they wish to continue in this sort of fashion they will be causing immense damage to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot defend <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by debauching it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those sorts of factors are tremendously important in assessing whether there were any reprehensible circumstances which would justify the kinds of debaucheries of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> undertaken by the Liberal and National Country Parties over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this country can no longer be regarded truly as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we claim to be a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I believe that they must be given an opportunity to state freely their views and wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the present Prime Minister cannot recognise that something very squalid has taken place- if he remains impervious to the decencies and niceties of the constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- then we are in for a very rough time indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rules of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country do not allow for one-man rule, they do not allow for one-man patronage and they do not allow for one-man circumvention of Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place I regard my duty to the parliamentary system and to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country very highly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also conscious that within the parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is fundamental that people who are elected to come here and serve and those people who serve the members and senators must have security or they will not be able to fulfil the functions for which they were elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two: The effective working of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends on the availability of adequate information and the capacity for its independent evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadcasting is, of course, crucial to the importance of mass communication in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It puts up with a thing that calls itself the National Country Party and another that calls itself the Democratic Party which perhaps has no relationship with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a government led by a Prime Minister without respect for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or the conventions of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me illustrate this by drawing the attention of the House to the State Labor Government’s promotion of so-called industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there is no more important issue than the operation of the franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The franchise is after all simply a means of allowing the people of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to express their options or preferences on any question which is before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it ought to involve the widest eligibility of the people in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This judicial arm is a very essential arm of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and we should be able to say that citizens could go off to a court as they could under the umbrella of an old, outmoded concept such as the one in clause 1 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government has no greater role than has any other citizen when it comes to judicial interpretation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a man who has to be admired for his liberal principles and his liberal attitude to life and his wish to ensure that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> survives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that I stand, and I believe that the Government has abused those principles- not only the common law but the platform and policies of my own Party, principles that I believe are essential if <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to survive in the way in which we people in the Liberal Party and National Country Parties desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we want confidence, if we want predictability in business, if we want to sustain <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, if we want to ensure that those methods which protect the family interest are upheld, we must not introduce retrospectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we not getting to the situation posed by Lord Hailsham, in his book,  The Dilemma of <span class="highlight">Democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The moment <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ceases to pay attention to the limitations and restraints which all governments must observe, it ceases to be a form of free government and becomes an organ of tyranny . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not only breaching two fundamental principles, one of law which will therefore weaken the rule of law in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and one of our party platform, but also giving on a silver platter to a socialist government a precedent upon which it can wreck this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these matters it is no good talking about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, justice and law if in the past a person’s own record is suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Terrorists are nothing more than common criminals and that the first thing that the citizens of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must do is to deny to terrorists any other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> all we can really do is appeal to the universities and the persons concerned for responsible and sensible behaviour, to pull back from the brink, to be reasonable and for the young student to think about the issues of the day more deeply and not to be led astray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Italy has been deprived of one of its greatest political leaders, one who in recent times sought through the democratic processes to build a consensus which is fundamental to the maintenance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is perhaps the most serious of the attacks on the very foundation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have yet experienced by terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of such a tragic and barbaric incident we can all resolve again that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be protected and will finally prevail only by a firm defence against terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House believe that a centralised government with all legislative power based in the hands of that one government centred here in Canberra is dangerous for Australia, dangerous for its people, dangerous to their freedom and dangerous for their <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Opposition has chosen to criticise the legislation on the basis that it rejects the new federalism policy is clear proof that it still adheres to its centralist aspirations of bringing all legislative power to Canberra and putting at risk the freedoms of the Australian people and the very <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which provides us with those freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the factors of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that we feel that even those who are on the side of politics different from our own, even those who in the political sense we hold in great contempt or hatred, are part of our own lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fundamental principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that an assembly with the equivalent of a government which has a majority of support should not be dictated to by an appointee with the title of Administrator who wants to interfere and sack people who have the confidence of that assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hawke has to learn to appreciate the difference between his position as  President  of the ACTU and his involvement with ACTU Jetset Travel Service Pty Ltd.

    <p>In any reasonable assessment of what happened last Saturday, it was a blundering, unnecessary performance and a clear exercise of political discrimination by a Minister who pleads the rights of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but practices the principles of partiality in support of those he wishes to advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am more convinced than ever before, after observing the man at close quarters following two intensive meetings involving a deliberation in excess of six hours, that in that office he combines a judicial appreciation of the rule of law under a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, together with an understanding of the rights of the individual Australian and of the necessity to ensure the national security of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which recognises and preserves the rule of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is no excuse under the laws of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for failing to protect people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that they will be considered elementary and non-contentious from the point of view of fair <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that no progress will be made in achieving genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country unless we look at trying to protect the rights of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is not just the preserve of government; it is the right of the whole of the people to indicate to a government what they think of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us be very clear that in international forums Australia should be seen to be a genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a country that believes in the rights of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, at the very least, I think it is in Australia’s immediate interest to support <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and democracies wherever they exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and liberalism that governments create a climate in which individuals decide for themselves how they will live their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this tolerance is the basis not only of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but also the whole human creation, kindness, compassion and understanding of another’s views which must be exercised in the balance of one’s moral standpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say this because it bears on a point that needs to be recognised, namely, that viewed through Western eyes there is inevitably some scepticism, and indeed perhaps an air of unreality about an organisation of parliaments from such a range of countries as the present membership of the IPU, including as it does most countries of the Eastern Bloc as well as other states with a dubious claim to the practice of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Labor Party mouths platitudes about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions, it has denied an ALP government any way of putting it into practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What it wants to bring about in trade unions under the guise of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is of course anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We live on the rim of a region where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a new idea whose hour had not yet come, where at best it is one aspiration among a host of others no less urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is somewhat paradoxical that a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should require such protection against its own citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greater the power, the authority and the activity of secret intelligence agencies with respect to its own citizens, the weaker that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is almost certainly an inverse correlation between the strength of secret intelligence agencies and the strength of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one examines the betrayal of the Weimar <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, one of the agents of that betrayal was its own secret police which owed a higher allegiance, or at least another allegiance in that deteriorating situation in Weimar Germany in the late 1 920s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role of the American secret agencies in the Mccarthyite perversions of the 1950s was a threat to the very <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the secret agencies were designed to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I exclude the people associated with the Builders Labourers Federation and similar organisations that cannot be tolerated in any society which regards itself as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and which places power in the hands of the Government to take action against conduct contrary to the best interests of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ASIO Bill which is before this House represents one of the most dangerous attacks on <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we could ever see in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report entitled ‘The Crisis of <span class="highlight">Democracy</span>’ talks about the problem of the governability of democracies’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless we do that I believe our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be eroded even further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that is tragic if we are serious about maintaining <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not think that a strong <span class="highlight">democracy</span> needed a security organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor took a similar view in his understanding of what a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could not foresee situations in which even a strong <span class="highlight">democracy</span> could be undermined by a very small group of people who had no belief in the system we have and no commitment to maintaining it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democracy</span> services and preserves that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by providing security organisations such as the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States of America and other similar organisations in developed nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of my greatest worries that the sort of people who are put in charge of security intelligence organisations, or who gravitate into prominent positions within those organisations, have a very narrow view as to what kind of political actions ought to be allowed in a country and what kind of actions are well within the limits with which a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can easily deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we in this Parliament are serious about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What an extraordinary sense of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I basically believe that we in this country have a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which is robust enough to enable us to accept precision written into laws which concern security and intelligence and which protect the rights of every Australian person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the very nature of the subversive acts intended to be kept under surveillance it must be a matter of judgment, both by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as well as by society, because a mixture of social, political and constitutional elements of the framework of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When they marched, the Leader of the Liberal Party in this House accused them of being pack raping bikies, raping <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was there not going to be violence and were not the whole constitutional foundations of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> threatened? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That situation may be acceptable in totalitarian countries but it is certainly not acceptable in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That leads to a consideration of what is, or should be, the proper place of a domestic security service in a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span> like Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> have been, and still are in some countries, classified as being subversive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout history men of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, great writers and thinkers, men such as Cicero from ancient Rome, Jonathan Swift from England and Orwell of the twentieth century, all feared informers with the clearest of vision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This should be the richest country in the world, given our benefits of stable climate, resources and a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that has been stable since Federation, since the start of Australia, largely by the efforts of the working class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If these high standards were not upheld, people’s confidence in government, a confidence which is fundamental to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would be undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when a man’s future is involved, when possible criminal conduct is involved, then that is the moment for a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to understand a basic principle; that is, a fair trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the very antithesis of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically this is a society which is a pluralist <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which there is competition between groups in the society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is going to survive, it is essential in the security area that we have a bipartisan attitude and an understanding of what information is being obtained, against whom it is being obtained, and a guarantee that it will not be misused or abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It leads to all sorts of outrageous imputations being made against others and it really destroys the whole fabric of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill broadly legitimises the use of totalitarian techniques, even if it is done in the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and removes such use from scrutiny and accountability in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that those people have a need to know that if warrants are being issued that they are being issued on a proper basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it extremely demeaning and obnoxious in a supposedly free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that an appointed director-general has the final determination over which information on what person or organisation may be provided to an elected parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary that we ought to be debating a clause like this which is so fundamental to the whole legislation and which strikes at the basis of the question of authority and the system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as it operates in this country, where a DirectorGeneral of an organisation whose record is not, to say the least, particularly good in terms of safeguarding the rights of the individual is, in terms of this clause, able to deny to the Parliament, and to the Minister, information which has been collected by the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that as long as the Government is prepared to allow a clause like this to stand within legislation like this, we cannot really believe that the cant about individual liberties, the cant about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the rights of freedom of speech and the right to organise, is anything more than cant or anything more than hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is the case I suggest that our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is very much in trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implication that in order to preserve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country it is necessary to disregard democratic safeguards I find not only an odious argument but actually a stupid argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why it is so important if we are trying to preserve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to preserve institutions such as this, whatever is the government of the day, that it must involve the Opposition as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we not have any regard or love for the parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we are talking about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this happens in the great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of the United States we can bet our lives that it happens here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not think I would ever see a day when a so-called parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would allow a Bill such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill, which will introduce into this country a police state, to be pushed through the Parliament without proper debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that the Government would at least have gone through the pretence of making it appear that we are living in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know of any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world in which such a motion could be moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we expect to maintain <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country if these Rafferty rules apply to the consideration of this legislation which has been dragged into this Parliament as a stop-gap matter for debate over the past two months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can continue to sustain itself if that sort of infringement occurs and that sort of damage is done to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would be no prizes for guessing who is the odd one out in terms of Christian principles, Greek <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, Malcolm Fraser and Professor Henderson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the Australian Government’s attitude to this type of repressive action under the guise of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament is the institution of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in every sense of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we at least want an effective Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members must do everything possible to maintain and sustain this Parliament as the window of that for which we all stand, that is, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the progress of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless something is done about this aspect of the Estimates committee system before next time around Opposition members will be wasting their time coming to Parliament to contribute to the Budget debate as the Government will ride roughshod over the parliamentary system and impose its will without any parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did that on the premise that a strong <span class="highlight">democracy</span> needed a strong Opposition and the Opposition had to have resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not helping parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by tying the hands of our shadow Ministers behind their backs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a travesty of the whole principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that a public servant should get a lot more money than the Minister whom he is supposed to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter that has worried other parliaments and other people who are concerned for the process of government in countries where the system of government is democratic and, particularly, where the Westminster system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the roles of members of parliament in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to make continuous judgments about the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of sorts and it is up to honourable members to make sure that that system prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In mitigation of the Republic’s administration under the late  President  Park it is argued by some that a little bit of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is better than none. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Events in Korea would make it clear that many there believe, however, that a little <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not enough and that human aspirations and human dignity demand more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can get decentralisation and genuine participation in all those senses- with a sharing of the control of industry between not just the investors and the bureaucrats employed by their money, where the manipulators who sit on the company boards manipulate their bureaucrats in the private sector and manipulate the workers and the consumers through advertising and otherwise, as puppeteers might- and unless we get interest and concern from consumers and employees, then we do not have industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we are going to have all the evils of the centralisation of the private  sector  which has been stressed by the honourable member for Lilley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that members of this Parliament should take every opportunity, when cases such as this are brought to their notice, to present the facts to this House to preserve peoples ‘ <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important from the point of view of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, that we teach the lesson on aid, that we genuinely say: ‘We not only want to give you the aid but also want to guarantee that it goes to development programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hope that it never becomes so and that it moves towards greater <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that the formula now arrived at will be revised in the direction of greater inputs from the consumers of this country, the growers who produce this sugar and the small investors in the companies which are concerned with the processing, selling and distribution of sugar not only within our country but also overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: I cannot understand why any government does not recognise that the deliberations of the Tribunal are in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst people may be critical of that, I can think of no better value for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than to see members interested in their nation and applying themselves fully to what they are about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ministerial responsibility is fundamental to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the end of the colonial era there have been innumerable conflicts, perhaps inevitable in the circumstances of the development of new power elites, often in a situation where <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as we understand it, does not exist but where pressures between traditional tribal groups formed by lines drawn on the map during the scramble for Africa conducted by European powers in the late 1 9th century are still only too real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to make certain that the guiding principle in the life of a liberal groups in parliament- those who say that they believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- is to protect the individual against arbitrary abuse of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we recognise the question of privacy and whilst we recognise the significance of having information disclosed, it is important to look at the matter from the point of view of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being strengthened to ensure that people elected to public office or appointed to public office do not get any financial gain by holding that office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to give a strong <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a chance to survive we think it is essential that a register of pecuniary interests be made available to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be well paid and have adequate remuneration but we think that the suggestion that they should also have other sources of income, assets and other means whereby either they or members of their families will benefit through their office detracts from <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make relates to the problem we have in Australia in trying to get through the message of what a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, they understood that it would happen because there was no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What forms of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> have been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-55">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>Did he state in his Alfred Deakin memorial lecture at Melbourne University that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> people could not be forced to work and that in the period before the 1930 amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration An which prohibited strikes absolutely, there were more strikes than at almost any other period in Australia’s history; if so, does he still stand by this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></li>
