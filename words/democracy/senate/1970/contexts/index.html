<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In conjunction with other nations, notably the United States of America, we wish to ensure that the people of South Vietnam have the right to live under a system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, with free elections and all the freedoms that we in this country particularly enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister also investigate the Communist decisions made at the World Federation of Churches, again as alleged by this great peace loving champion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> from Boothby? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political issue in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a matter for the individual and when there is an attempt to confuse political issues with trade union activities tremendous damage is done to the causes of the ACTU and the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I wish to add by way of underlining the facts is that it is a very idle use of question time for the Opposition in the Senate to talk about the candidates for a Vietnam election when elections, as we know them, have no vestige of existence in the Communist parties which are opposing the establishment of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement on international affairs, the then Prime Minister stated:  1 make these remarks not because I desire even to appear to resist the development of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in other communities; on the contrary, it is one of the great hopes of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> at long last will have a free go in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  has conceded the wisdom of the measure in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and there is really nothing further to be said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all look forward to the restoration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to the concern in some Opposition quarters about trade union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confer with the appropriate State Ministers and his Federal colleagues, to inject <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into funds of this nature? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Leader, as a parliamentarian, not consider that such action for such a reason helps to destroy the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of the Senate as a very important arm of democratic government in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That support should be given to the growing world movement for the return of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> one of the purposes of debate is to enlighten the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those who believe that parliament is the focal point of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> believe that senators should have a reasonable opportunity to speak and to ask questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the undersigned men and women of Australia believe in a Christian way of life; and that no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can thrive unless its citizens are responsible and law abiding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will see that the powerful communicator, television, is used to build into the nation those qualities of character which make a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work- integrity, teamwork and a sense of purpose by serving, and that television be used to bring faith in God to the heart of the family and national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should the Court Government pass this Bill and at some future date invoke its fascist provisions could any action be taken by the Australian Government to protect the civil liberties of Western Australian citizens and the existence of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The annexation and incorporation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union has not been recognised by any Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that whilst we have people like  Senator Bishop  in the Ministry no fears need be held by anyone in regard to what we are trying to do in bringing a new charter of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The annexation and incorporation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union has not been recognized by any Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not important for the future of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country that a clear vote of the people should be secured to see - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic and fundamental issue which we in the Opposition are asserting and will continue to assert is whether the people of Australia, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, shall have the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that in a complete <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there should be this method of election carried through to the ultimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a very sad day for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia when we start to quibble over a few dollars in relation to whether or not the public at large ought to know the contents of a document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am asking again whether the Senate is going to tear up <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and deny me the right to have this table incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that they will be worried tonight because of the complete destruction of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have seen today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want merely to say on behalf of the Opposition that this is one of the darkest weeks of so-called parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have ever witnessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As professional librarians we are strongly committed to maintaining the free flow of information which is essential to any elightened <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> has just Mown out the window if the Minister got the call in order  10  move a gag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure is synonymous with British parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we have come to respect and cherish in a world in which many forms of government are practised, in many cases to the detriment of the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect that concerns me greatly is the growing trend in this country - a trend that 1 feel is a danger to the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom that we have won over the years, and a trend that is condoned by many - to buck authority, the laws of the land and our law making institutions under the guise of freedom of speech, the rights of the individual and the rights of minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under British <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it the elected representatives of the people have the final say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were never afraid in the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to express their views, but the Liberal Partyapparatus is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Leader of  the Government in the Senate state what action the Government has taken about the member of the Liberal Party who has made public statements, which have not been retracted, that he supports trampling upon the human rights of the people of Rhodesia and that he supports legislation which is anathema to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom loving people all over the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I say that in the United Nations at the present time we need a spokesman for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - a man who will defend the small nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to show the Communist world that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has more to offer than Communism has, let us take a country that is desperately in need, build it up and show that something can be done there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way we can win the Asian people to the side of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge America and Britain to take up this challenge now and to make India a worthwhile country and one to which everyone can look and say: “This is a country in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has shown exactly what it can do”.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that one man expressed the opinion that, because of those factors, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that country had defeated itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether we should read George Orwell’s book on the Spanish Revolution or whether we should read other books to the left or to the right of the views in that book, but we should have a 1 970 concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and those who support it have been challenged constantly by members of the Opposition because, as they say, we have not had the courage to justify and support the Government’s attitude in maintaining that the security of South Vietnam is an appropriate cause for people who desire liberty and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> throughout the world to espouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we should believe that this sort of information should not be confined to a few people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that they cease reflecting upon their own meetings and turn their attention to the overall administration of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which exists in Australia and is administered in the Territory through the present Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government pays lip service to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to getting the royal assent to Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to debate this issue because I believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in government by the elected representatives of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never let it be forgotten that the Weimar Republic was a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was destroyed by mob rule on the streets by competing factions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>i  object to the doctrine that law and order must be obeyed according to the book and according to the letter, and that this is the only test of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, because all too often it is the very means by which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is destroyed and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have consistently said that the National Service Act is a bad law and that all of the restrictions on civil liberties that exist in this country are bad laws because if one has not the sense of freedom and the sense of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at heart, if one is not prepared to speak up for one’s fellow men, then all <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an opportunity now for any Government supporters who have any semblance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in their hearts to come out and lead the Moratorium Campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rose to speak on this matter primarily because I want to say something about what I believe is a debasement of any real <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country by the smearers and character assassins who attack this movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  ask the Leader ofthe Government in the Senate: In view of statements of Government supporters who say they believe in the people’s right to dissent and protest in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but who claim to he very concerned at the possibility of violence on the day of the forthcoming Vietnam Moratorium pro- test, will the Leader of the Government in the Senate request State governments to close off for 30 minutes traffic from certain streets in capital cities where these protests are to he held, as is frequently done for marches and like events, and thereby show that the Government is sincere in its endeavour to see peaceful protest demonstrations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If by that he meant that government by the people is government by the mass of the people, then I would give him credence but government by the mass of the people means adopting something like the Greek city-state idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Dr Cairns  is putting forward, what the Moratorium Campaign appears to be based on and what the members of the Labor Party are giving credence to is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and cannot be <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Government in Australia or in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, cannot take shipping companies or private enterprises by the scruff of the neck and say: “You establish here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we have known <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to date, it consists of an organised community under a constitution that has been accepted by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have spoken in this debate because there are principles in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that can be abused if they are misunderstood, and there is every possibility that by the mass movement involved in this Moratorium they will be abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is said that we who have a duty to civilisation, a duty to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a duty to the young men of Australia should keep out of this Campaign because there are some Communists in it or Communists may be in the leadership of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said before in this place and I have no hesitation in repeating that there is a right in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of orderly demonstration and orderly dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: I have no difficulty in saying that the right of dissent is recognised in the framework of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but that right of dissent does not mean that when you do not like a law you can break it by demonstrating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Leader of the Government in the Senate justify parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when he uses Dorothy Dix questions at question time as a means of attacking the Moratorium and peaceful students who want to demonstrate against the Vietnam war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, with a sense of responsibility, wishing to preserve what we have built up in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> throughout our history, is concerned about people doing these things, inciting others to break the law and inducing innocent people - starry-eyed people, if you like - to become associated with them without realising the type of association they are getting into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has always been a source of amazement to me that I never hear one good word from these apostles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> from the Opposition, for this country, South Vietnam, which is being racked by invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the handicaps which are being placed on the government of the country by, unfortunately, a fairly large number of the Government’s supporters and a small number of Ministers the people of Australia are not going to get the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will say this: In that event you would not have an insincere leader; you would have a person who really believed in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the loyalty of the people of this country, their belief in standing up for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for the freedom of individuals in this and other countries, if the Labor Party comes out with this sort of thing again it will be decimated again and the opportunity that it might have had will be gone to the moon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am convinced that the average Australian believes in his own mind that the greatest insurance policy which any Australian government can give this country is by cooperating and working with the United Slates in the fight for freedom and liberty not only in this country but in other countries which need our assistance, lt staggers me to hear honourable senators opposite who are failing in what their Party has stood for over the years - the love of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the belief that we should help the underdog and those people who need help - now talk as they have done tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I only hope that the leaders of this Government, instead of sitting back and taking a defensive attitude, will take more of the offensive in this political fight and show the Australian people that what is being done is the right thing for the preservation of liberty and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that their purpose in sending conscripts to be killed in Vietnam is to save <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but their <span class="highlight">democracy</span> consists of refusing to allow scholarly discussion, serious discussion relating to the Labor movement, to take place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what they understand by <span class="highlight">democracy</span>: That we should be a society in which a man who is able to travel freely in Europe, whose books are available throughout the world, should be denied the opportunity to enter this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: T wish that some of these people who protest could go and see the good’ - I emphasise the word ‘good’ - ‘that my comrades and others have done, not just for the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in keeping a foreign enemy out of this country but in helping the reconstruction and development and the opportunity for freedom and advancement for these people.1 Here is a young man who has been willing and prepared to sacrifice not only his career but, if necessary, his life and when he comes back he is prepared to stand up and say these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, what is this Moratorium doing in reality other than assisting the Communist cause of subverting the cause of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the development of self-government in South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Standing Orders and parliamentary practice have provided vehicles to enable senators and members of the parliaments of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to discuss matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said previously, and I still say now, it will be a sorry day for Australia if the tactics of the Moratorium - the espousal of a doctrine that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be in some way expressed by mob rule on the streets - ever wins any public acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When expressions like that are used in what is one of the freest, truest democracies in the world it is an indication that the whole sympathy of one Labor Party  Senator in  this place is with people who are completely opposed to the principles of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which are characteristic of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we associate this with the doctrine that citizens have a right to disobey any laws which they please and couple that with the view that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and decisions equal or greater in importance than decisions of the Parliament can be made in the streets, we have for the very first time in this country the emergence of a philosophy and a doctrine which can be used if people wish to do so for nothing less than revolutionary purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope we still have some <span class="highlight">democracy</span> left in Australia, although tonight’s proceedings would not resemble it too much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose again to complain about the way in which the Government has dragged <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into the dust tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is being aided and abetted in its attempt to stifle <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to tread the trade unions into the dust and to treat with contempt the laws of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> should reign supreme but the Government is treating it with contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 features which bring shame on the spirit and letter of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are the application of the gag and the Leader of the Government in the Senate breaking an arrangement he had with the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I appreciate that that happens, but there is less <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for the trade unions under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we were still sitting here at 5 o’clock tomorrow morning or 5 o’clock next week it would be well worth the task if it meant that another such shocking burden as this would not be imposed upon the working people of Australia as has been imposed by this Bill and imposed in a way so contemptuous of the Australian Parliament, Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that means travail, if that means in the words of other people a polarisation, a divisiveness in the community, and if the civilisation which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has created is worth while having, then its preservation should require the enforcement of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is its report of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we are preserving in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The small numbers who went out in protest showed clearly that people were not prepared to accept this blatant attempt by the leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to oppose parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and this was basically what  Mr Hawke  was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to survive as a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the strength and stability of the family unit is fundamental to our very survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is most important in maintaining permanence in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This we must guard against if we are to survive as a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the fundamental strength and security of the family unit is basic to our society in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the supporters of the Moratorium; the people who would bring mob action to Australia, mobs  in  the streets as a method of government; the people who clearly advocated, as  Dr Cairns  has done, that anarchy should, in effect, reign: the people like  Mr Gregory  who have advocated that anarchy should reign and that we should no longer have any regard for the parliamentary principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, that it is right and just for people to take over if they do not like what is being done by a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Commonwealth Minister and his Government, for example, rising in the Parliament to tell the world thai Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would be threatened by a short visit from one of America’s vocal, but non-violent, rebels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that those people would be the last to talk about a double standard, yet they are the ones who posture as the defenders of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and at the same time prevent the free transit of a person into this country without producing one shred or tittle of argument to show why he should be prevented from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days the old timers would look at me and say: ‘If you do away with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> you get a dictatorship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I would reply: ‘Surely we can improve on our parliamentary system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever happens it is a great tribute to the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of this place where  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson and myself- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> does not subsist only in speaking for a great time on a small number of subjects, but perhaps dealing with more subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strikes and contempt for the rule of law strike a body blow at these 2 vital institutions in our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is often said - I believe that it is said with great truth - that if one wants results in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the end one has to have a public opinion that impacts upon the legislators everywhere they are meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier means the Friendship Society - the Conference to End the Vietnam War (a front of another Communist body, the Peace Council), the Brisbane Committee for <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> in Greece and has actively assisted in the organisation of two Vietnam Moratorium Campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the House and the electorate at large an assurance here and now - these subversive elements will be closely watched by my Government in the future and their activities against decency and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also advocate the restoration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Greece and I attended conferences of the committee which seeks that objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one on either side of the chamber would deny the desirability of having <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Greece or in any other place, yet according to  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  this is an indication of subversiveness and disloyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not allowed to do these things this is no longer a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Labor Party, by identifying itself with the Moratorium campaign, has shown to the people of Australia not only that its own platform, policy and resolutions mean absolutely nothing at all but that it is prepared to align itself with Communists, it is prepared to align itself with those who want the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong to win and it is prepared to align itself with those who would cheerfully see the overthrow of Australian institutions and who would cheerfully overthrow <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the rule of law and the basis upon which everything that has made Australia what it is has been built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members opposite allow this kind of conduct to continue it will not only damage the Liberal and Country Parties, as it is damaging them, but, more importantly, it will damage <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These subversive elements will be closely watched by my Government in the future and their activities against decency and the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, as was put by way of question this morning, that the whole essence of our way of life and of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is for everyone to accept that we must follow the rule of law and not resort to anarchy to which some people would try to lead us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attack upon the fundamental basis of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for an honourable senator to be accused, under privilege in a State Parliament, of subversion and disloyalty for engaging in legitimate political activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the functions of the Postmaster-General’s Department as an agency of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in relation to expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with the large number of people on the roll in Britain, the Post Office there is able to give that free service to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is throttling <span class="highlight">democracy</span> completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tf we want <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to function, we must have the maximum number of these small papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It prostituted <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the basis of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the individual speaks about matters that are important to him and relevant to the things that have been put up to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Liberal Party does nol seem to command a great deal of support in the Australian Capital Territory, that I suppose is one of the anomalies of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because Canberra, as the city which it has become, has been developed under more than 20 years of successive Liberal-Country Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the intention was of course, for the Prime Minister, through the activities of the Government - the numbers racket of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - to pass the Bill before the deputation arrived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, thanks to the application of the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by Government senators and members of the Democratic Labor Party, the debate has been kept alive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much  Senator Young  likes those nice words ‘freedoms’ and ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>*, we will be moving amendments to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I often wonder how many sins are committed in this world in the name of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision may have been made in the cause of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but, I believe that in respect of prices it was one of the worst decisions that people of this country ever made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do honourable senators opposite  -  I say this without being offensive - mouth these shibboleths of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when they know it would be practically impossible for  Senator Young  or any other wool grower to establish any person in the wool industry today at the current price of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe thai it is vital to the maintenance of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the amendment which has been proposed by the Opposition be supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a service to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Administration has introduced and supported a law which makes a mockery of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; which is open to abuse; and has many of the aspects of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the way as far as <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believed that when 1 came into the Senate I would see some type of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight I have seen <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at work and it has been prostituted <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I believe we have seen <span class="highlight">democracy</span> denied tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in this country not in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as an end but as a means to a higher and more desirable objective and we are endeavouring to give, in a very short space of time, to the people in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea a recognition of the advantages of this democratic method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole point of what  Mr Whitlam  has been saying in the Territory is a negation of the developing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that country and for that reason, if not for many others, his remarks are to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is need for a clear recognition of the fact that Australia respects the developing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and will respect the wishes of the local people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Territory is a developing <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In showing that contempt he has exhibited an arrogance which amounts to a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we in this Senate owe it not only to the people of Australia but also to the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to affirm positively that we respect their developing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that we will not impose upon them self-government or independence contrary to their wishes, it is up to the Australian Labor Party to indicate clearly and emphatically whether it believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea or whether, contrary to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, it will impose the wishes of its own authoritarian party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One basis is the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> owed to the people of Papua and New Guinea and apparently the second is that the Australian Labor Party is not observing its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senator.applied their minds purely to policy they might say that it is a disgrace that, in the year that was set aside  to  consider the whole topic of human rights, Australia,  Which  once had a proud position in the advancement of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and its contributions to human rights, was not cosponsor to one motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will, be aoneparty state, as is the position in nearly every state in Africa, where the trappings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may be maintained but stark autarchy is the method by which the governments operate and the people cower under the heel of single party governments which arc reinforced by secret police and often a brutal military command. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By opposing this resolution tonight the Labor Party clearly states that it does not believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, does not believe in the freely expressed will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack pointed out, a Socialist does not believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move this motion on behalf of the Opposition because 1 believe it is time that the Senate asserted its rightful role in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite do not help us to carry this motion, then woe .betide them, because on any occasion on which they carry a motion the Executive will be able to ride over them in complete disregard of their wishes,  aDd  consequently <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be at the crossroads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any democrat were io allow such a challenge to succeed he would be helping to destroy the very basis of his <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By what warrant and with what justification in terms of law and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are  Mr Hawke,  the ACTU and the Australian Workers Union entitled to say whether 300 sheep should be exported? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister ‘ to do these things, because they are very important to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I believe the Senate has a very important responsibility to fulfil in order to preserve the parliamentary system of government and parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the proposal that has been put forward on the notice paper because I believe that, the Committee system is in the interests of the Parliament and the Australian people and that it should be encouraged to ensure the preservation of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This focuses attention on an extremely important principle of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of representative government, the genesis of which, so far as this Parliament is concerned, occurred in the Senate last year during consideration of the Parliamentary Counsel Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not care what it is called but the Australian Government calls that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> every citizen should be free, within limits imposed by laws designed to strike a reasonable balance between conflicting interests, to give expression to his views or to his sentiments by the process of peaceful assembly, lt must be recognised that the right to dissent carries with it, as one of its aspects, a right to use that process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By not giving the Opposition this opportunity the Government is making a bit of a mockery of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>democratic government, some semblance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that people, especially the young, feel strongly enough about public issues to want to proclaim their opinions publicly in the streets is something which should be applauded by those who care for the health of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not whittled down further as is proposed by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as everybody has said tonight, every citizen should be free, but he should be free within limits imposed by laws that are designed to maintain a reasonable balance between conflicting interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cannot be denied that the freedom to express individual opinions and ideas and to join with others in such an expression is a basic right in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> must ensure that the right to change the law is maintained but the claim that freedom depends on breaking the law must be rejected completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was put before the people as a great principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that people should have this right and that the anti-litter law should not interfere with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What should come first in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the right of peaceful assembly, the right to dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want the true basis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, every person in this national Parliament must be able to express himself clearly, according to his conscience and in the spirit that what he is doing is in the best interests of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  quite rightly referred to this great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the Southern Hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We cannot blame people who visit us and say: ‘These people are not that enthusiastic about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because they have not built a permanent place to work in’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, we live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and even this Government may have some difficulty in surviving until August for all we know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The position which applies throughout the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that Ministers are chosen by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am seriously suggesting that if the Government continues with this attitude through this Budget session then it ought to call it off and have an election so that some form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be returned to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when the Government cuts across our Standing Orders and the principles that have been established and shortens the period allowed for question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the procedure which was adopted today will not be pursued in the future because there are many people in Australia who want <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to operate as it should operate and not as the Government believes is best for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the recent experiences of his predecessor in negotiations with the Hospital Contribution Fund of Australia and the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia on membership contribution rates and the subsequent comments by the New South Wales Minister for Health,  Mr Jago,  and myself that all funds should consult their members in such critical negotiations, will the Minister legislate for fund <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which, in the case of those 2 funds, is non-existent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator asks me to give a judgment on the very important issue of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that exists within the various funds, whether they be hospital contribution funds, medical benefits funds a Hibernian Society fund or any fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition is that there should be <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in some funds and not in other funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is government by the people, and government by the people demands action by the people, lt demands effective ways of showing what the interests and needs of the people really are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said other things too and those things were related to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being expressed in the factories, in the streets and in public places wherever people are to be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is that some unrepresentative bosses, representative of and responsible to nobody, should decide who ought to make these decisions and that, of course, is a negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Equally, the Opposition has this right in respect of its own affairs; it has responsibilities in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-128-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the happy day comes and there is an election, the people will reaffirm what they have reaffirmed every time since 1949, namely, that our way of government in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a better way than the system advocated by the Opposition, and it will give stability to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-128-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Government made any approach to the Siagon regime about this abysmal lack of democratic process following Australia’s contribution of 470 Australians dead and a great sum of money expended for the so called maintenance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is  Mr McLeay,  whose main contribution to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country has been to go to the African countries and say that Australia - particularly the churches - is riddled with Communists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe there cannot be genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as long as parliament and the public

    <p>Let me say that I am a believer in the democratic processes - action by the

  <li>
    <p>The awareness of these traditions and the long and illustrious line of people who have
            upheld them in the interests of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> makes me humble because I
            realise the privilege and the double responsibility which has been bestowed upon me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government received from champions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia any request to deny admittance to Soviet sporting or cultural’ bodies, such as the Russian ballet, until the Soviet Union changes such policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government’s bowing down to the demonstrators on this occasion mean that, in the event of demonstrators entering the chambers of this Parliament and shouting, tinging bells and blowing whistles, the parliamentary business will be closed down, which would be regarded as another success by the demonstrators but which would strike another blow against <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As hundreds of Australian conscripts have been killed in South Vietnam while allegedly fighting to preserve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and as Air Vice-Marshal Ky was until recently held in high regard by the Australian Government, why has this Government done nothing about his allegations of a lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the South Vietnam presidential election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we become so subdued that we cannot express a point of view - be it as a result of a decision of a caucus, a government leader or a Party leader - we reduce <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to a miserable farce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the freedom of that man to speak for 4 hours is very important within the portals of Parliament where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists, or is alleged to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any one of us could state a belief that a person has spoken for too long because we have not enjoyed or followed properly his speech, but his right to speak is paramount if we are to adhere to the system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a number of people feel that they want to have a say on some matter on which they feel strongly, I think <span class="highlight">democracy</span> demands that they be given sufficient time to debate the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A community which is in a free society, a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, running through the parliamentary system, has some very basic principles which it must follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an attitude which is completely subversive to every fundamental principle of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as well as being subversive to the security of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was talking about the 2 basic principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the first one which does not concern us at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time we were told that the whole future of this nation, the safety and security of Australians and the preservation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, Christianity and our Judeo-Hellenic heritage depended upon the dispatching of 20-year-old conscripts to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that opposed to these commissars was our great and powerful ally, the United States of America, steadfastly determined to oppose Communism and to support <span class="highlight">democracy</span> even if supporting <span class="highlight">democracy</span> meant sending troops into the Dominican Republic to depose  a  democratically elected president. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are not involved in this at all but you remember several years ago when the war in Vietnam was on, when we were saving the one candidate presidential <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of South Vietnam, that the Australians sent 8,000 conscripts up to South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Thailand has now followed Cambodia in the process of non-democratic government will the Australian Government, which has used men and money to support so-called <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Vietnam, make public its displeasure at the way in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being challenged by our former allies in Indo-China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of his most interesting speech, the Prime Minister dealt comprehensively with the parliamentary system of government in Malaysia and the Malaysian concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which had been evolved - not merely a formal matter, I may say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable senators to recognise that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a minority voice, as we hapen to be at this moment in the Senate, has placed upon it under the Senate committee system a much heavier burden than that which is imposed on the major parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another point that greatly disturbs me is that this Bill, which to my mind offends against all human rights and political <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, will receive passage through this chamber: but if this legislation were in the form of a regulation it would never be approved by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We talk about the development and potential of our great young country and yet if we subscribe to the views of the Australian Labor Party on the subject of defence we indicate that all the things that have been achieved over the years matter very little to us and that we are content, prepared and willing to hand them all over to anyone who is prepared to challenge the continuation of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> does exist under the coalition, which is contrary to the situation in some other areas that we know of in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we have to recognise is that in this <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of ours we are dependent upon each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is involved here is a serious question in relation to the operation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of the Government, the Opposition and the people of Australia a full and frank answer is required from the Government as to whether <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should work in Australia in this clandestine fashion or whether the traditional open <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which has been practised in Australia should continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was virtually the flushing out of traitors of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a ridiculous assertion to suggest that a body which is concerned with Australia’s defence, the maintenance of Australia’s freedom and the alerting of the people of Australia to the menace of communism should in some way be regarded as manipulating <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am grateful to the Labor Party for having raised this matter because, instead of referring to anonymous documents, instead of referring to those people who have said something but who are not prepared to put their name to it and instead of using this place as the means by which to defame, slander and denigrate people outside the Parliament who do not have the opportunity that members of Parliament have of saying what they would like to say in this place, we should look at the record of one organisation which has manipulated <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, which has been declared by a very well known and established Australian organisation to have so manipulated <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and which has, when certain political advantages have been achieved, and the cloak has been removed, told us that it has not manipulated <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the way in which the original condemnation had it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would only say in respect of  Mr Cairns,  because the comment has been made, that I know and his colleagues know that he is a person who supports the Liberal Party, who supports <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, who believes in freedom and who opposes communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I admire  Senator Murphy’s  tender solicitude for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that it is a secret organisation working for the destruction of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is so absurd that I feel that the Leader of the Opposition must have been joking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us face it; it is the science of numbers that destroys <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not as though the report already has not been ruminated upon in the false stomach of the Committee before it comes into this chamber, and this, in my view, in a form of participative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> gives greater opportunity for worthwhile discussion than can be given in a debate in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take it a little further, we could say that in Australia, through the avenue of the Statute of Westminster, we certainly did achieve political <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This raises the question of whether it is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it to protect the public - whether we must protect the public interest for our own preservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This motion could result in a short-circuiting of the processes of public debate; a short-circuiting of the processes of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a short-circuiting of the opportunities of members of this House to express their views adequately and properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has now been proposed that the time limit be reduced by one-third and  Senator Young  has suggested as a natural corollary to agreeing to such a proposal that there should be a reduction of onethird in the time limit of all speakers in such a debate, lt would be making a joke of the whole procedure of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if this motion were carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We speak very loosely about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the greatest system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the emerging countries which have tried <span class="highlight">democracy</span> have finished up with a form of government that nobody in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> wants - a military dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that many of these countries are evolving and are now being maintained under military dictatorships, one country that has clung to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is India, with all the problems of its more than 500 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he feels that he has been justified in putting the Commonwealth Police into this position by his haste, not only should he apologise to them but also he should apologise to Chris Shanley 1 say in conclusion that I quite understand the concern of  Senator Turnbull  that we should see before our own eyes in the precincts of Parliament House, the centre of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, this fascistlike conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When members of the Opposition denigrate the police, they do not harm the police; they harm the Parliament and, through that, they harm <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we examine the Government’s case we see that it expresses a great deal of concern for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is interested in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I suggest that it should apply democratic principles right across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I find it somewhat hypocritical of the Government to say that it is concerned with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and with the rights of members of trade unions, when the members of these important organisations, which are concerned with the medical and hospital rights of contributors, have no say in the running of the organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any suggestion by the Government that there is any concern for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in respect of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is not borne out in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is so concerned about this great democratic method of election it should move quickly to that end, with the co-operation of State parliaments, to ensure that this system of so-called <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is available to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am hoping too that legislation will be enacted to protect the rights of shareholders and give them some feeling, some element of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is claimed by Government supporters - I deny this - that no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists within the trade union movement, and if it is claimed that the ordinary . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I feel that in this area there exists no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because the small shareholder in a company in this country has very few rights, nor does he have what we consider to be a democratic right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever there is wrong with the United States, at least it pays a little more than the lip service which is paid in this country to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the process of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being furthered by engaging in a long debate on a subject on which we are all in agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With great respect, I say that it is the right and privilege of journalists in a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to speculate in that way and I believe that the honourable senator ought so to regard the comments to which he has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our percentage of unemployment, even at the present rate of 2 per cent, is infinitely better than that of any other Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, particularly the United States of America and the United Kingdom which have suffered unemployment to the extent of  5  or 6 per cent of their immense work force - in the United States now for several years and in the United Kingdom for 3 or 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the oil industry dispute  Sir Robert  Askin did not do a service to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by demeaning John Ducker but now, for cheap, snivelling political purposes, Government supporters suddenly put him and Bob Hawke up as paragons of virtue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to our system of government, I heard what he said, and it is not convenient tonight to expatriate upon it except to notice that this Bill and the request that underlies it - a request to remove the limitation on the number of members who should occupy executive office - seem to indicate that the House of Assembly of the Territory is readily following in the footsteps of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by which it has been guided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If fundamental requirements for more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom were set out in a letter from the Government to  Mr Clunies-Ross  in 1968, why has the Government failed to ensure  Mr Clunies-Ross’s  compliance with those directives so that the islanders could be freed from this so-called benevolent despotism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a great need for a change of government if <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as we should define it, is to be maintained in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to have a responsive government and a government that is sensitive to the will of the people then the system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should be such that the government can be readily changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the Leader of the Opposition’s proposition is a very valid one and one which ought to be observed if there is to be any sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this Parliament and in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the cornerstone upon which the state will be erected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us make it quite clear: The rule of law in the kind of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we follow is one that, being made in this Parliament, is a charge upon every member of this Parliament to obey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must be right across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, how those people decide to get their amusement compared with other people is their own business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that one of the real tests of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is whether a person sent here by his electorate is allowed to vote as he thinks best for his electorate or whether he should vote as he is told to vote by somebody who has not been elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The High Court expressed the view that it was not its prerogative to interpret the Constitution but that the Parliament, being the supreme body in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, should grasp this problem and deal with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do not make hasty decisions on what you think are the political moves and attitudes of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> today, because unless you are prepared to abolish <span class="highlight">democracy</span> you will receive a check in the future, which will surprise you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what I meant when I said that, after all, we cannot have a millenium because we must sometimes temper <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the stage where we make it work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not that I disagree with what  Senator Little  has had to say because I think that the greater part if not the whole of what he had to say, except his conclusion, ought to command the support o anyone in this chamber who thinks about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and its meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> had to be tempered in order to make it work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Reflection will indicate that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in the sense in which it has meaning and is traditionally practised involves people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our system is really representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work there has to be a limitation on the number of representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a single member constituency which is the traditional one under which our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the Westminster tradition has developed or there is the system which has its origin more on the continent of Europe than in the United Kingdom of having a multi-member constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be dangerous in the extreme to the workings of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have the same system prevailing in each House of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reason I have indicated, namely, that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must be made to work, and because it would be foolhardy to have precisely the same system applying in both chambers, I believe that as we have proportional representation in the Senate, we should retain single member constituencies in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, I feel that the case which the Democratic Labor Party has made in support of its amendment is not a case which will make our representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work in the effective way that it must work to maintain its public acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is the more substantive  question of whether the functioning of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to be served by the granting of the vote at this time and, for my part, in the immediately foreseeable future, to persons between 18 and 21 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I believe in compulsory voting because I believe the most important function in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is for people to exercise the duty of determining which of the opposing parties they prefer as the party by which they should be governed, I think it makes, theoretically or philosophically, for a sounder base for our democratic system than any of the systems under which there is voluntary voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am in favour of compulsory voting for reasons which 1 feel I have outlined and because I believe it makes our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> more meaningful for the people who participate in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad that  Senator Greenwood  is present to hear my remarks because I think that he, of all members of the Government, is the one who is called upon the most to introduce some clarity in these dark places, in the interests of the Australian community, and to state that both the major parties are dedicated to the upholding of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and are in no way tainted by  -  I cannot remember the exact words of  Mr Sinclair  - this fossil from the past, this ugly spectre of fascism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is only conducting it through this place on behalf of another Minister, but he knows full well from his own experience on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee that that body is an essential instrument to preserve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a great tribute not only to the people of Australia but also to our way of government in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - and, I might say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is a tribute to those who have had the responsibility of government in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure honourable senators will join me in conveying sympathy to the families and associates of those former members of this Parliament, each of whom contributed in his own way to the growth of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730227_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Liberal Party senators are the people who talk of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then appears a classic of guided <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by the Country-Liberal Party coalition in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that is applied in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having done so they have taken <span class="highlight">democracy</span> unto themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, to claim that the Government is following the will of the people would be a dangerous precedent for a democratic country; just as dangerous as the spectacle of this Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being controlled by a 2-man Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that to do so is to do a disservice to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps somebody may think that something we have said is wrong but at least it will be healthy <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Menzies  went on to say:  lt is understandable that some Yugoslav migrants of Croatian origin should continue to hope for the establishment of an independent Croatia and within a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> like Australia they have a Tight to advocate their views so long as they do so by legitimate means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I believe he has made a major contribution to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently their concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is having a political police force whose activities are secret to the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To do that is to strike at the fundamental roots of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and at the principle that a Government should stand up to its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt puzzles me mostly to find that honourable senators opposite must take this matter up time and time again when it is as plain as a pikestaff to the Australian public that the greatest disservice done to any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that done by men in authority who refuse to provide the strongest weapon which any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has to defend itself against attack, namely, the weapon of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the last election we received the overwhelming number of votes and for the first time, thank goodness, despite the gerrymander of the honourable senator’s Party in 1965, the electoral weight of the people was so much against the then Government that they threw it out of office and now we are trying to bring parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> back into the Australian electorate by reducing the 20 per cent disparity to what was normal custom, practice and tradition until 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at this system of first past the post voting which the Labor Party claims is the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is relevant because this Government is endeavouring to gerrymander itself into power permanently, and  I  can think of nothing worse for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point is that the Government’s contempt for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> extends into this Parliament, and therefore this chamber must be very careful about accepting any proposed amendments to the Electoral Act which would perpetuate this Government in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If an honourable senator is to conduct himself in this way and speaks in that fashion - and I repeat that  Senator Kane  is the greatest political accident that ever sat in this chamber - 1 wonder where parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the drawbacks in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that, being a numbers game, the interests of minority groups are not protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once one breaks down that principle one breaks down the whole principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and every person in this chamber knows that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But immediately we destroy the concept of one vote one value, we destroy our belief in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we could finish up with a fascist state, or one electorate of Australia or, as someone suggested, one party in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Immediately we tamper with the people’s House and depart from the concept of one vote one value, we destroy the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which we all believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it was at the age of 21 that a person was entitled to exercise the franchise and to vote in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are entitled, within all the limits of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to seek to change the view of the legislature in which the powers are vested by the people to make decisions on behalf of all the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator’s belief in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is such that two honourable senators from one side and no one from the other side should have a go, then I disagree with his contention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is, of course, so much arrogant poppycock from somebody whose estimation of his capacity is so great that he believes that he does not need the endorsement of the people in this <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is true, as Labor senators in this chamber said when in Opposition, that the idea of the Senate Estimates Committee is, ‘through the Ministers, to be able to draw out of the departmental officers the facts, the thinking of the departments, to get a participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> between members of the Public Service and this Parliament, then the Government of the day cannot have any alibi for preventing the special advisers being brought into the open and being subject to scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This may be the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> honourable senators opposite believe in, but it is not my idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and I would hate to be associated with them in any forum in which the public tests their ability to be democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this country, as in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which places reliance upon the enforcement of law and protection of the people, officers of the law who protect the rights of the individual can be placed in dangerous situations at times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard the word ‘democratic’ used in respect of one section of the Australian Labor Party, and the word ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ has been thrown across the chamber in recent weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a two-way process, and if the Parliament is going to work, and especially if this Senate is going to work it requires some common sense and co-operation from the Opposition as well as from the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter which I believe should be in the forefront of our attention this evening is the extent to which the Standing Orders of the Senate as they are now in force are adequate to preserve the institution of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That frivolous interjection simply reveals the indifference of the Labor Party to the question of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom of speech not only in this country but in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise tonight to appeal to the Senate, to the Standing Orders Committee and to you  Mr President,  to call a most urgent meeting of the Standing Orders Committee to ensure that this vital principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of parliamentary government in this country is inviolate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It makes me sick in the stomach to see a person like this talking about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope they will learn their lesson about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and will ensure that real democratic processes are observed in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Western rapprochement with the Soviet Union could be dangerous if the West acquiesced over the lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the Soviet Union, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> today is such that people are becoming more and more aware that the citizen has a right of access to knowledge and information, and this right of access to knowledge and information is one which, if I may say so, should not be affected by political situations or political differences, or indeed compromised by political pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to see that honourable senators opposite have realised the great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that obtains in the Australian Labor Party, that a wide diversity of opinion is tolerated, that we are able to live happily together although differing on some points, and that we certainly are able to emphasise points differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be reported through the media to the people of Australia so that there can be dialogue and participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> involving this Parliament and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should have a reconsideration of the values of those Senate committees and decide whether they are doing a service to the system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or whether they are only time consuming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We appreciate that the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has made a great claim, and he has sought to give expression to this claim in various ways in this Bill, that unions should provide for a form of participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that he has missed the point when he says, as he did in answer to my proposition, that there was some sort of contradiction in his attitude towards union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the question of amalgamations and union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the question that we are considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that  Senator Greenwood  is caught in a fundamental contradiction here; and if he insists that there should be this ultimate <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the matter of amalgamation, I think he is caught with the proposition that the members should also be consulted about what to them is a much more important thing: That is, an agreement about their wages and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A takeover or Indonesia or South East Asia by Communist regimes would pose a grave threat to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot understand why we have to impose our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know that our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I suggest, would be the direct antithesis of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and clearly would be outside the general public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next logical step is to ask what has happened so far as trade union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this appeal to  Senator Hannan  in regard to his fears about the merger of the metal trade unions killing trade union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was there ever a bigger scandal in regard to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than to allege that the amalgamation was democratic when only about 1 7 per cent of the members voted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do Government Senators call that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other point that needs to be made relates to the history of the big amalgamated unions in other countries.. Go to Great Britain and ask about the Transport and General Workers Union and about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the Amalgamated Engineering Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that once there is a huge amalgamated organ- .isation <span class="highlight">democracy</span> flies out the door because it is too big for people to get to the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view that is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The highest aspirations which the Prime Minister expressed were not with the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not with the principles of a country espousing the British law, the rule of law, not finding it there at all, but its highest aspirations were symbolised with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have endeavoured to deal with all of them because I concede the right of the people in the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to put their views and, as far as possible, to receive an answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, in the case of elections of national governments as well as of State governments, this medium ought to be available to those who want to communicate their political ideas to the people and to those who want to receive those political ideas, and this ought not to be on terms of some prohibitive price being imposed so that political parties and electors have a price tag put on <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> surely they will give an area with u population of 120,000 people representation in this honourable Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned I think it is the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that senators from the Northern Territory, whether they come from Alice Springs or Darwin and whether or not I agree with their point of view, should sit in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, if we believe in broadening <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there is only one answer, and that is to support this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the more senators we have here from the distant parts of Australia the nearer we will get to the real essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no way that we can fertilise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> other than by assuring that representative Calder has a couple of senators to assist him in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If in the normal development of the processes of constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the processes of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the wishes of one chamber are not acceded to by the other chamber then the other chamber has its options as to what it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it a complete negation of everything that we stand for in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to suggest that people cannot be put into a job to do something for the community at large when they have special knowledge and a lifetime of training and experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that these groups work in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is abundantly clear from questions which we have asked in this place and the answers which we have been given that the enormous police raids of early April were a farce, a disaster and a negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not the perfect way of running a country, it is the safest way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is an extension of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think anyone who believes in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would disagree with him in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that that is not a proper course of action and that it would be far more consistent with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to let the matter pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Government has put up the proposition that because one House passes a Bill for an Act to hold a referendum we in this place ought not oppose it but we ought, in the interest of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to allow the people to exercise their judgment on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a right which is sacred in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if, on any matter of government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would be absurd, as a denial of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as fund <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is concerned, I have waited in vain for some injection of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in relation to funds consulting their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point in relation to fund <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and  Senator Douglas  McClelland in his own effective way will deal with much of the structure of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I did not think I would live to see the day when among the elected representatives of the people, one of those charged with implementing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, let alone a man in the highest office of the land, the Senate of this Parliament- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there is no room for that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After promising the  Deputy  Prime Minister, as he did, that he would amend the advertisement to show the correct picture, that was  Mr BjelkePetersen  ‘s idea of fairness and that was his idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer is a very humane and honest man and we do not question for one moment that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there has to be a certain degree of trial and error. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is a time and a place for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a reasonable and sensible procedure and the Government ought to have enough wisdom to accept it in the interests of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that it is not a very good day for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when the Opposition parties, after having so decisively rejected this measure, which was simply a measure to put the proposition to the people, now, again, in March- when the Government is proceeding as expeditiously as it can to fulfil the constitutional requirements- are pretending that they need time to make up their minds or to debate the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these slurs about the Senate and its members, and the claim that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be denied are a red herring drawn across the trail that is being laid by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the Opposition’s idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to endeavour to delay the Government’s program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may be allowed to continue,  Senator McManus  having had his say, I suggest that all the crocodile tears that we have had from  Senator Greenwood  and all the appeals for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we have had from  Senator McManus  are so much hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I suggest that despite all the indignation that we have heard from senators opposite, theirs is an insincere and phoney argument based on a desire to avoid the judgment of the Australian people and not on any devotion to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He spoke a lot about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put this simple propositon to  Senator Wriedt  who is the senior Minister in the Senate chamber at the moment: If the argument is that merely because a Bill passes through the House of Representatives twice with a constitutional majority it has to go to the people because that is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, will he - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government proposition is that merely because a Bill to alter the Constitution passes through the House of Representatives twice by a constitutional majority it can- it does not have to betherefore be submitted by the Governor-General to the electorate, and that that is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, will the Government give an unqualified undertaking that should the Senate twice, by an absolute majority, pass a Bill to alter the Constitution, even though that Bill should be rejected, laid aside or amended unacceptably in another place, the Prime Minister will advise the GovernorGeneral also to submit the proposition contained in that Bill to the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can get that sort of unqualified assurance from the Government then there may be some substance in the argument of honourable senators opposite when they prate about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But without this sort of unqualified undertaking, for Government members to talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to talk about courage is nothing more than a cheap debating point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can get this unqualified undertaking from the Government that it will submit to the people referendum proposals passed twice by this chamber and rejected twice by the House of Representatives, let us have no more talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in submitting matters to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s paid, glib writers who had been students of the Kennedy regime in America of the 1960s had seen a Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> hungry for values beyond the material values, hungry for what is called the quality of life- the environment, conservation, the general human values - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the monarchy is one of the most enduring and substantial things where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is practised in the British Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that under its jurisdiction <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has operated better than it has done anywhere else in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Politicians, irrespective of the Party to which they belong, have a responsibility in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, unless they reside in one of those privileged nations which has either a fascist or a communist dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that the Government’s idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wishes to fiddle with the Constitution which took years of consideration by the fathers of Federation to compile and which gives us the whole basis on which the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of this country has functioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does  Senator McAuliffe  consider that to be <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that the Government should have at least provided qualified opinions as to whether what the Prime Minister has put is correct before it came forward with all this malarkey about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government call that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, that speech, and that is the Labor Party case to the people to which I referred, gave no hint of Labor’s plans to launch, with unprecedented intensity, an attack on the very cornerstone of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, namely, the Austraiian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we speak of houses of parliament we are inclined to eulogise all the abstract virtues of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this is a great danger to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that these opportunities should not be made available to the people is to deny <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that this House of the Parliament, and this <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, exist in the belief that sovereignty lies in the people, and that power lies in the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Patry’s claims that we should not annoy the people with elections is fundamentally to denigrate the system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really to argue for the destruction of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not have elections, you do not have <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the power which resides at present in the 2 Houses of this Parliament should be reviewed as frequently as possible and as desirable so that the people in Australia can sit in judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in a world in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is shrinking; in a world in which violence and anarchy are growing; in a world in which freedoms are under threat, we should do everything we can to preserve the decentralisation and diffusion of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Senate should not be in the position of being a rubber stamp for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government sees the Senate as a frustration, an annoyance, an inconvenience- as undoubtedly our authoritarian Prime Minister of today does regard the Senate- then this is part of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and I believe <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is worth it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it is fortunate for the workings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that now they are able to be elected at a different time, because the role of the Senate which I have just mentioned as an independent body reviewing legislation is aided by that fact- and notwithstanding that it is seen by some as an annoyance and an inconvenience, the way the Senate is functioning is part of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and it aids the democratic processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this, I believe, stems from the fact that the Senate in the role that it has performed has served <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and has not frustrated it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will continue to serve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> so long as it is not tied to the elections for the House of Representatives in a way that cannot possibly be broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet they talk about us as if somehow or other we are running the Senate, whereas every educated child in the community knows that there is a temporary defect in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the community in that the Government, elected by the people, is being frustrated in its will by those senators opposite who are yelping out and not letting me speak freely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We challenge this attitude of the Opposition, and we say that Opposition members know very well that if <span class="highlight">democracy</span> prevails in this country so many of the old, worn out shibboleths, the old bone rattlers of the last century, the old horse and buggy mentality which has been astride this country for so long will be gone, that their days of philandering will be over and that there will be new era in Australia in which we are prepared to go straightforwardly to the people and say: ‘In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the majority of the people’s will will prevail’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reflecting <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I suppose that it is probably reasonable in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that even the Government is entitled to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened here is one of the greatest negations of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that those opposite with their temporary majority are daring to arrogate to themselves the right to prevent the Australian Government from going to its own people and asking them whether they will say yes or no to an amendment of the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the ultimate in the negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Sunday the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made a television appearance and intoned further platitudes to the effect that he and his Caucus were going to make Australia a veritable Utopia, a model of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the eyes of our neighbours and the world’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is far from reality to call the Bill ‘s proposals ‘democratic’ Indeed, the Bill is the antithesis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows also the absolute inconsistency of the Government because it is so apparent that what was being urged by this Government as the hallmark of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in 1973 can be discarded and regarded as being of no account in 1974 when we have a Bill which preaches precisely the opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely that is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about, because that is the power which a Parliament should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it certainly has proved to be far closer to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than first past the post voting, which was the love child, if I may call it that, of the Labor Party for a considerable period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because it is one of the major parties in an electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that one party should have that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Labour Party of that day have suggested that only the majority parties of previous days had a right to live politically in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparison with the system that operates in New Zealand and the system that operates in the United Kingdom, the Australian democratic system as it is applied to this Federal Parliament is as near perfection as <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can attain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are all matters which are now well accepted features of our Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no substance in the view that the Labor Government, or the Prime Minister, is seeking to curtail <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of members of the Opposition to the other 4 questions is that they do not intend to provide for democratic elections; they do not intend to give the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory any rights to vote in a referendum; they do not intend to allow local government authorities to come before the Loan Council; and they do not intend to allow any of the things that we believe will bring greater <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this has destroyed in this country the concept of what I call a property owning <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which so many of us have stood for all our lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will see that the powerful communicator, television, is used to build into the nation those qualities of character which make a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> workintegrity, teamwork and a sense of purpose by serving- and that television is used to bring faith in God to the heart of the family and national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that everybody who supports the Labor Party and everybody who supports <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will have a look at Federation Insurance Ltd and see that it is the type of organisation which, no doubt while it pays money to people who prate about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom of speech, is prepared to deny a man and his family their livelihood because the man belongs to a legal political organisation and wishes to exercise his democratic rights as a candidate for Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, and whereas our existing Australian flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the Government-General and State Governors, and the independent courts of justice, and whereas all such rights, liberties, heritage, advancement and prosperity, etc., are of no avail if our armed forces are unprepared or incapable of repelling invasion of our shores or withstanding other military threats, so therefore must all these things be accorded the highest national concern and priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have on the other side a body of people, who parade the virtues of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and who have pledged themselves to uphold law and order, denying the highest authority in Australia the opportunity to determine an issue that is of importance to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite talk of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but when it comes to the crunch as to whether <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being observed we must have a look at some of the activities of these people who claim to be so righteous in their attitude towards <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On that occasion a Senate vacancy was caused by the death of a senator from Queensland, and this man who now professes to have all the rights to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> made a complete and utter joke of the process by which a successor was appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not dismiss the Government in this chamber; we merely say: Go back to your masters, the people, and let them decide whether your actions of the last week will preserve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and good government in this country, or whether they will destroy the prestige of this House and the other place for all time.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We prate about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that some of the small health funds could not be faulted on their <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if I ever meet  Mr Cade  outside the Parliament I will ram this report down his throat, because he is one on the people who has denied <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that they would be serving <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the little people in the community if they offered constructive proposals and did not become the lackeys of the vested interests that are the free riders under the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The founders of our Constitution realised that that principle did not apply in the case of the Senate, which is just as much a House of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as is the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a complete system of corruption designed to get control of the Senate as it now is and, in the offing, we have proposals to alter the electoral system to ensure that if the Labor Party cannot get its way by bribery, it will get its way by altering the electoral system in a way which is a gerrymander and an insult to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That surely is what representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is essentially concerned with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to be meaningful let us use as many opportunities as will present themselves to let the people have their say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we have not reached the stage in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where the Government announces: ‘There is going to be an election, but we are not going to tell the Opposition because we want to book all the halls and make all the arrangements first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that it would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on a matter of Government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, if the Senate, representing the States and not the people, could reverse the decision on a Bill passed in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a good thing for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we all go back to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) That the Senate believes that the system of imposed regionalism being effected by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development under the Grants Commission Act 1973 will promote centralised direction and control of regional activities and destroy the ability of local government to respond to the needs and aspirations of its citizens, and further urges State governments and local authorities to be active in promoting and maintaining basic <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by safeguarding the rights of local government bodies so that they are responsible to those who elect them for the policies they pursue, and (2) that the  President  of the Senate is directed to convey the text of this resolution- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which I believe is the Australian way, has reached great stature because of individualism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There seems to be no reason at all to get away from the basic principle in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of the community’s involvement in government, the power and involvement of the people on the spot, so that their knowledge and priorities may have proper significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government with the power and involvement of people on the spot is as basic to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as is the strength, sovereignty and involvement of the people through their State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These political personages who are so superficial as to suggest impropriety in the Senate action in putting up the processes for a double dissolution and committing both Houses to a decision by the people are completely betraying the fundamental rights of the people to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it would be within the spirit of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that in that situation the Government in another place should recognise that we in this chamber have inescapable and inalienable duties to study the legislation on its merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I believe, is a development in this country which was not seen in the years of the Liberal-Country Party Government and which, if it develops at the rate at which it is currently progressing, will destroy the integrity of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So do not start talking to me about constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span>,  Senator Greenwood,  because quite seriously you are politically fraudulent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Getting back to what we were talking about before  Senator Greenwood  was foolish enough to talk about constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it is good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if 1,000 people leave a metropolitan Sydney metropolitan electorate and another 1,000 people take their place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the Government’s honeyed and pious words in the second reading speech which tried to indicate that it has some dedication to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, this Bill is not intended to produce a just and equitable electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Kingdom is held up as the greatest example of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes this Bill because we feel it is a step forward in the long and difficult journey of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as I have always known it, is that the will of the people must prevail, that government must rest on the consent of the governed and that no voter must be favoured or discriminated against in the exercise of his vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must rest on the principle of majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that is the pattern of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> set by the Mother of Parliaments, which retains the principle of one vote, one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority- if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or partiesit would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think it is in the best interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for the Opposition to employ this kind of tactic again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the course it adopts is politically right, whether it is in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or an affront to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is another question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much has been said on the pieces of legislation on the 3 occasions they have been before the Parliament that there is no point in going over the basic <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an obliteration, such as we saw at the last election, of many more honourable senators opposite if they insist in attempting to deny <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us remember the only point that I really rose to make: It does not strike me as being a great defence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to suggest that one representative is enough for 30,000 voters in a territory and that 15 representatives are appropriate for the State from which one happens to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, we would have to say that the diffusion of power through <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is effective only when the voters take an interest in what policies are presented to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One million people not covered by health insurance is a lot of people in a country with the pretensions which we have of being a modern and an efficient <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there are not too many Australian Medical Association meetings at which there is a quorum and there are not too many doctors- it is a bad thing for our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- who take too much interest in the affairs of the AMA or the General Practitioners Society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> within the Liberal Party and for the policies which were produced in those dramatic days over Easter of 1 974; the policies which suddenly emerged but which still do not seem to receive universal acceptance among Liberal Party supporters themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government ought to recognise that the rights which the Constitution confers are rights which all parties, whether they are in government or in opposition, ought to protect because they are in due course the only protections in our constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we can rely upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are safeguards which make <span class="highlight">democracy</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> this chamber must be supreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this the way in which the Government expects <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to be carried on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The power to take away a permit or licence from a person who is engaged in the actual work of exploring for minerals on the basis that the Minister, in his own discretion, unexaminable and unchallengeable by the courts, makes such a decision is in my opinion the antithesis of all that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and responsible government recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was interested to hear  Senator Steele  Hall’s remarks over the last few days about a commonsense approach to many problems and about the traditions of parliamentary practice and parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is in the Australian community a cynicism and, indeed, a great measure of concern over most of the basic things that concern us as Australians operating what is, and hopefully what shall remain, a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today they did not get the respect to which they are entitled, and I was ashamed to hear from those who profess to believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> words such as those which emanated from  Senator Wright  today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been rightly described by  Sir Robert  Menzies as a falsification of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if on any matter of Government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fitting that the first Bill to come before this first Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament should be designed to strengthen the equality of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To resist that simple, clear and basic principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have had this long campaign of obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a possible disparity in the value of votes is inconsistent with the full realisation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For its content and its implications, for its real value and its symbolic importance, for its contribution to the cause of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a world where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> seems daily more frail, I commend this Bill to honourable senators and members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are resolved not to let legislation go through the House of Representatives and the Senate which we believe is bad in principle and which would detract from the constitutional principles of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That system has survived and it has never in any way dinted <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it has contributed to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are looking for true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> why have we allowed this to happen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our system in this country has stood the test of time; our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has worked well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a quick look at what happens in some of the other countries with no less an attachment to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and equality of representation than we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia did not give a mandate to this Government to change the whole nature of the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no other way to look at Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the electoral processes are manipulated to serve the political interests of persons or parties it would be a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  gave us one of his lectures about how <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is so frail in Australia at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not hear him say anything about what  Mr Mundey  said yesterday when he was attacking <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does  Mr Whitlam  talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being frail in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is frail in Australia because one chamber of this Parliament is prepared to exercise its rights which it was guaranteed under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and his Party are the people who are putting <span class="highlight">democracy</span> under attack m this country, not the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stood here and lectured us about the frailty of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when he and his Party and his supporters outside are doing more to pull it down than anybody else in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister stood up here and lectured us, as he so often does, about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and about what that great Chief Justice Earl Warren said in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, he certainly did not advert to the Supreme Court case of February 1973 involving the State of Virginia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority- if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or partiesit would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only those who believe in a selective form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will oppose the principle of equality of voting and the elections of governments by the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Country Party depend on this form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for their survival, individually and as a Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last vestige of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has gone under the administration of the Country Party Government in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In defence of his Party’s vested interests in this Parliament and throughout the country he has deliberately sought to abandon a vital aspect of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> upheld by successive Labor Prime MinistersWatson, Fisher, Scullin, Curtin and Chifley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Prime Minister who is prepared to come into this chamber, on an occasion such as this, and, mouth the fundamentals of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but who clearly is unable to provide leadership for the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at the present time is not capable of maintaining the confidence of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is supposed to be <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the right honourable gentleman’s Party supported the situation which allowed 20 per cent but it did not provide for that variation because it sold out to the Country Party any principles it had in regard to electoral distribution, lt is a great surprise to me that the Liberal Party which, at the turn of the electoral wheel, might one day- a long way off I feelbecome the government of this country in its own right, will never, as it sells out to the Country Party and allows that weighing of electorates, achieve what should be the objective in a 2-Party system which relies on traditional Westminster style <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of governing in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That every citizen should have an equal voice in the Parliament is the very basis and foundation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that situation does not endure <span class="highlight">democracy</span> does not endure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, at this Joint Sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, this historic occasion, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia is on trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let those who stand for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> speak today in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real problem of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country is the sham of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not do much good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have people sitting here for 20 years because they effectively and safely represent very small areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be much better from the point of view of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if seats were made more marginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the Senate white-anting <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but I simply remind him and others that the Senate has just been re-elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>.All this idea of a handful of men getting hold of the State machine, having the right to make the people do what suits their party and personal interests or doctrine is completely contrary to every conception of surviving western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From listening to the supporters of the present Government speaking on this Bill today one would gain the impression that they believe that they have a monopoly or concern for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure all honourable senators and members that this is not so, and that the LiberalCountry Party coalition Opposition feels just as strongly about what must be preserved in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as does any other member of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preservation of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is possibly the greatest responsibility which lies in the hands of the members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> will never be perfect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Chief Electoral Officer and the Electoral Officers in each State have shown, by the results in the past 2  lh  decades, that they have been men who have taken notice of the need to preserve our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we send our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> down the drain we are losing everything in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, that preserves the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which allows the honourable member for Grayndler, with all his weaknesses, to come into this place and to promote and propose legislation which is to the detriment of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I sincerely hope that, when this legislation has passed this Parliament and finally goes to the Electoral Commissioners to be implemented in the redistribution of the electoral boundaries of this nation, they recognise the tremendous need to preserve the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we have followed for three-quarters of a century under both nonLabor and Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a rninimum requirement of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that they should be so represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet you describe us and particularly my Senate colleagues as being the white anters of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, an expression used last week by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You claim to be the champions of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and yet in Government you have used the gag and the guillotine in that short period of time more frequently than any other party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To use your own terminology, you are not merely the white anters of the Parliament or of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, and in order that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may have a chance to survive in this country, I firmly believe in the abolition of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These 6 Bills found their way to this Joint Sitting and they are opposed even in this last hour by the Liberal and Country Parties, not out of wanton obstructionism but because this side of the chamber, representative of opinion held over a wide spectrum of the Australian people, believes that they are bad in principle and are likely to detract from the effectiveness of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe every opportunity ought to be taken to emphasise that there is a threat to the position of Parliament, to the position of an elected Government and the whole institution of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party remains quite firmly and simply committed to the establishment of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the disciplines of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the union movement, as they should apply in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was developed on the Rights ofthe Magna Carta to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free nien and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement, the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very interesting observation on the working of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that, on reflection, it is 3 years since that reference was first made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the passage of this Bill by the Senate is as good an example of the workings of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as I have witnessed in the time that I have been here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that I do not share the views expressed by  Senator James  McClelland and others that the passage of this Bill has demonstrated parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at its best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not regard this as a matter for a party but as a matter for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for all members of the Parliament to seek to reach agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then take the spectacle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> out of the hands of the individual and give this power to the type of organisations, of whatever sort- commercial or political- which have been known around the world at particular times to be less than savoury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently I do not believe that this really contributes anything to an effective <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to make any further comments other than to say that when the day arrives that people are not entitled to accept a suggestion made by whoever it is, so long as they exercise their own free will, and to send a telegram to a Minister, a Leader of the Opposition, or whoever else it may be, we have reached the stage where we no longer exist in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no gain in that sort of circumstance in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had these electorates been distributed in a way which was compatible with <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- honourable senators will recall the great declarations by the Supreme Court of the United States of America that an election by the people means that there must be equal electoratesthe coalition would have gained 52 seats and the Australian Labor Party 30 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a comforting thought for the ALP, but I think it is an even more distressing thought for Australia and Queensland that we should have existing in Australia a State in which there is no <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there it is clear that the ALP would have lost- we face that- but it is not satisfactory that we allow to persist in our community an undemocratic system, a gerrymander of the worst type, which results in ALP members being put out in droves, in a manner quite unrepresentative of what occurred in the voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the points that  Senator Murphy  has just made about the manner in which the electorates have been gerrymandered for the purpose of maintaining in power a man who does not understand the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a blot on <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this nation that we have people in this chamber who want to perpetuate this sort of system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, with our checks and balances in the Federal system, that we all at times- trade unions and employers- try to get the best of both worlds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democracy</span> faces a dilemma about the extent of controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, that right rests with the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surely not unreasonable to describe such an action as an outrage of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a denial of the New South Wales voters’ democratic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could any Australian doubt the obligation of these and all other senators to stand and be counted for the convention, for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, that is a denigration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former Liberal Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  has said that  Mr Lewis  is mad in his threatened attempt to usurp <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and parliamentary representation is now under a threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren may not think that is necessary but most Australians believe that respect for the law, its institutions and its personnel is basic to the survival of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and freedom in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wicked socialists, taking a leaf out of the book of their opponents, the devoted protagonists of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> who saved Australia from the wicked socialists by refusing Supply, say: ‘Well, that goes for us too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that happened the democratically elected Liberal government would be thrown out by the sheer accident and unprincipled conduct of the Labor governments in South Australia and Tasmania and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now we have this second attack on the general conception of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about what is about to happen in New South Wales where there will be an attack on the general concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as held by most of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember clearly over a number of years appeasing those who would circumvent <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, that is a denigration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition said that to vote for a party ticket in a Senate election is a denigration of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second requirement of law and order in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the people should be assured that when they vote at an election their vote has some meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So already <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself is distorted by the composition of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole point of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that people who have strongly opposing views compete within the electorate and compete within Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone is going to depart from that practice because he objects, however strongly, to the party to which he is opposed, then he is setting out to destroy <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the same way as <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was destroyed in Germany in 1 933, in Austria in 1 934, in Italy in 1 92 1 and in Greece in the 1 960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is a very fragile flower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from a handful of countries in Asia and the Caribbean <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists only in countries where there is a relatively high standard of living and where there is a relatively high standard of education, and it does not exist in all of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Martin  apparently disagrees but the facts remain that it has been in times of stress and economic tension that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the most vulnerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in similar times of inflation and unemployment that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> collapsed in those countries in which it did collapse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are going to depart from the principles which govern a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and make enough people think that, though they voted in an election and elected a party to govern, that is really meaningless and all sorts of steps can be taken to abort what they have tried to do with that vote, those people who are already dissatisfied because of economic circumstances and do not like the economic system will also have a contempt for the political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that amendment because we want to get a unanimous resolution of the Senate, but I hope that historians when they look back on the history of this debate will judge the integrity, the honesty and the consistency of those people who have talked so much about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and law and order but have done so much to damage and discredit them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The violence done to important conventions and well established customs by the Whitlam Government which has done and is doing violence to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a sorry day for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when we give to the Executive the power to disallow Acts of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament should be supreme and to give to the Executive the power to disallow Acts of Parliament is a power which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> gives away at its peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pretty shallow base and it is humbug for  Senator Greenwood  to prate about parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when he has voted, and led his Party to vote, against the inclusion of representatives of the Northern Territory in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another side to this matter of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that that side of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- the use of regulation making power- which will receive scrutiny in this place, and the safeguards of disallowance, if necessary, will be scrutinised by Northern Territory senators in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have simply said that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> gives this power to the Executive at its peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Let me put it to  Senator Wright  in this way: It is possible today- because we have <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia- for minority groups to advertise expressing their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation there is an attempt to rape <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone in this chamber would deny that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be imperilled with’ the proliferation of lobbyists who abound in Canberra and in all capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some of the tactics that were used against John Gorton were not good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite candidly that electoral developments in Australia and what happened at the time of Watergate are not good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether he gets done or not, that is a healthy form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> means that if somebody has a grievance and is well organised, without any of the sinister applications, he can reach his representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of situation in which people get a belly-full of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; they know that it is not fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by definition does not work if half of the people do not take part in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I maintain that in regard to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> 3 things are absolutely essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not an irrelevant or uninteresting fact that in the last ten or twenty years attempts to introduce <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into African countries have failed so dismally all over the continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has happened, not because there have been no people educated in the workings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why in the socialist countries of Eastern Europe there will not be any developed <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because, apart from other reasons, there are no people who are able to exercise their facilities, their money and their time to produce assistance to political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Mulvihill  said in his speech that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> could be imperilled by a proliferation of public relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a right to interpret what the people of Australia wish the Senate to do, because this country is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and is not an autocracy which is run by  Mr Whitlam  for  Mr Whitlam  ‘s views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can survive if it has not a responsible and recognisable brake within its constitutional set-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> surely it is important for people to be able to pass judgment on a government as it proceeds along the line, otherwise there will be the establishment of a totalitarian circumstance from which there will be no return, no matter, to what end that totalitarian circumstance may be directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that history is against  Senator Scott  and that his fears of the onset of some evil totalitarian regime, of some sinister plot by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to demolish <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, just do not hold water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened in vain for some argument designed to show that what was considered a progressive, sensible and moderate suggestion, as indeed it had to be, coming from a Committee of that composition, has suddenly become a proposition of fire-eating radicals with a sinister connotation of the subversion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the third reason that the Government gives for the introduction of this Bill, that is that the Government thinks it should be able to sue and be sued in its own courts, 1 think that in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> no government should put itself above its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I should think that the proposition put forward by the Minister for Health would meet with the approval not only of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation and the other relevant unions but of all those concerned with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in industry and the participation of those who work within an industry in the management of that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the use of this new economic <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the Government, by threatening to reduce or even withdraw its commitment, will have control of the future management, extension, development and expansion of the State hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, under the form of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have, the Opposition, whether in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, ought to acknowledge that once a government assumes power, having put its programs to the people, those programs, having been properly identified, ought not to be resisted unless there are special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he learnt of the possibility of the Senate taking this unprecedented action of refusing Supply this gentleman,  Sir Robert  Gordon Menzies, described such action as a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We collaborate and co-operate with our allies, but we do not get dragged along by the nose and do things that we are told to do that are against the very best principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and against the very best principles of the Australian nation and the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill is an assault on <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; it is a Trojan horse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill is, in my opinion, essential in that it brings <span class="highlight">democracy</span> closer to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fully aware of the immensely important area that we are discussing, for in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we live under social, industrial and economic laws which are of necessity, if we are to survive, related to majority opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> laws must reflect the majority opinion of the people of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, as does  Senator Melzer,  that we should have an electoral system which promotes <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in our country and which elects the people which the majority of voters wants to see in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in the areas in which we have our major amendments the Government, being concerned with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, will in all probability agree with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this sort of attitude or this sort of result emphasises the fact that Australians, as electors and as members of a great <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, have sufficient responsibility and intelligence to understand the sort of questions that are put before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this bears very little relevance to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, because first past the post voting exists in a considerable number of countries around the world and in almost every instance it can be shown that minority governments result from a first past the post system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first past the post system will bring about a situation in which there will ultimately be, as there seems to be in most of the countries that adopt it, a dictatorship of either the Right or the Left, and I am sure that this is not the objective of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this or any other land where real and effective <span class="highlight">democracy</span> still survives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the system which ensures that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the majority does not only appear to rule but does in fact rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that 70 per cent of this Bill is a satisfactory contribution, but those areas to which 1 have drawn attention are areas of extreme importance to the establishment and maintenance of a proper <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all deference to  Senator Scott  and  Senator Withers  the whole idea seems to be that if these reforms are accepted in toto this will virtually strangle <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking  Senator Scott’s  argument to its logical conclusion, he advocates that the proliferation of parties is good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him consider the pre-Hitler era in Germany with a proliferation of parties which by their fragmentation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ushered in Nazism, or the decline of the Fourth Republic in France, again with a proliferation of parties, and compare them with a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> like Canada or Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present Opposition has prated about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for 23 years, but while its members were in government they did nothing about electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make many glib references to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but everybody knows that the great leveller is the fact that we cannot control who moves into an electorate and who moves out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While trying to ensure that the world is safe for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we should not ensure that the world is safe and cosy for just the largest parties in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> catering for everybody and everybody should have an equal opportunity of recording their vote as do the great bulk of the people- by going along to a polling booth and recording their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, should have our polling booths open for a sufficient time to give everybody a chance to vote on that day as the great majority of the people in Australia are able so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it is quite easy to say we should cut down the hours for voting but, when all is said and done, as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> our aims should be to get every vote possible and therefore whilst it might take a couple of hours longer than some people want I think that in the main the extra votes that come in really suit the true democratic purpose of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> trying to sift out and find out what is the final thinking and decision of the people of this country so far as the elections for the Parliament is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a very precious privilege is for the people to vote and to elect the Party they want as the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is a slow, lumbering process but, with all its faults, it is the best system so far as freedom and opportunity of the people are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must recognise that it is a slow lumbering process and that the people in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are not perfectionists so far as voting is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course elections are the backbone of any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the makeup of the next Parliament will depend upon the form in which we finally pass this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we are considering a Bill, the aim of which is, or should be, to amend the electoral laws to increase the chance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> functioning properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take 3 days or 10 days or 5 weeks to learn the result of a Federal election, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is well served if it is the right result- using the word right’ in the sense that it is the result that the community wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the aim of the legislation is to improve <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, we cannot really do so by disfranchising people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said in my speech on this Bill earlier tonight, we should make it as easy as possible for people to stand for Parliament and to serve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) 1973, the Minister said this about electoral laws:   if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or parties- it would be a denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be fashionable- certainly it may be fashionable with the present Government- to decry prospective revolutionary situations, but there are many democratic countries in this world which have lost their <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because an internal revolutionary situation has developed in respect of which the Government of the day was not alerted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But for those who propound the theory that there must be one vote one value or there is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I go on to another series of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it promote a referendum in which it says that, because it is so wedded to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country and to the principle of one vote one value, it intends to ask the electors of Australia to take away one Tasmanian seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has imbibed deeply of the Orwellian concept of Newspeak; that is, call gerrymander a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and call <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a gerrymander, distract attention from your own villainies by planting them on your opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has always been a process of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that minority groups have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of talk around the place about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh  has been making great forensic noises about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People can talk about allowing a certain amount of tolerance, and we believe in that principle, but a 20 per cent tolerance is a complete negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have gone over this two or three times, and listening to  Senator Baume  and hearing other comments one would think we were some European country that was going through a political upheaval and that the light of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was going out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is an injection of vitamins into <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make a remark or two concerning equality of representation because I believe that in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> this is of extreme importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the variance in virtually every <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is enormously in excess even of a margin of 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when it puts m a representation for its own seats it puts in what amounts to a corruption of every principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I ask: Is that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Bill that refers to the educational circumstances of this country, which is a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, must be of major importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ensure that education in any field- certainly in the trade union field- will produce, or will aim to produce, a flexible and reasonable society, because it is only in this circumstance that a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to survive as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I believe that the public has to be kept fully aware of the options that it has and of the attitudes and priorities of the various organisations, educational and otherwise, that exist in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is inseparable from <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and why, to be true to itself, it must work through a government responsible to a universally elected assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this confrontation between the unions and government which I think poses ultimately the greatest challenge which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country has had to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows now, of course, that the Labor Government in Australia is no different from any other government which practises <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From their own training they know all about marxism, social <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the principles of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and I believe that people have a right to express themselves if they think that the government of the day, whichever government it is, alters things in a way which is thought to be wrong so far as the developing and increasing of our population are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When both of those things are gone there is some chance that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will return to Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet  Senator Sheil  says that these people are living in a spirit of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other factor that does interest us very much is the problem that we see growing in every <span class="highlight">democracy</span> around the world- I include this one- namely, the dichotomy between representation and management and the difficulty in getting into mesh an accelerated program of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that something was exceptional about this proposition from the way  Senator Wright  spoke, but I remind him that in that citadel of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, Queensland, the office of the Parliamentary Counsel is in the Premier’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of all these parties have stood four-square for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> throughout Western Europe and Asia: The party of Helmut Schmidt, the party of Sicco Mansholt, the party of Harold Wilson, the party of General Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the parties 1 mentioned have stood four-square for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and have been the principal bulwarks against barbarism, whether they have come from countries which erroneously describe themselves as socialist, or which dishonestly describe themselves as democratic, like  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Wright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to traverse the ground covered by  Senator Wheeldon,  but it is worth drawing to the attention of the Senate that  Mr Sule  the Leader of the Radical Party, who came to this country, was able to convince all the members of Socialist International, which is representative of the broad stratum of social <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the international scene, of the terrorism that exists in Chile and of the unconstitutionality of the military group currently running affairs in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been argued by my colleagues, the Socialist International is a group of people who have pledged themselves to reform, to establish a system of social <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by parliamentary action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be extraordinary when people in this Parliament say that they believe in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and then start to defend the takeover of a parliamentary system by a military junta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has before it a Bill which would enable the Opposition to enshrine at least in one direction in industrial matters the principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in union management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense we are a pluralist society and our functioning as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends upon having a government which is able to balance the competing interests and is able to make the necessary decisions as to which interests should have priority over another interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The custodians of political decentralisation, of State autonomy and of grass roots <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, sent their Canberra heavies to Perth to straighten out the Western Australian deviants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the most credible versions, of course, is that these emissaries of the Canberra custodians of State autonomy, grass roots <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and political decentralisation- that is the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  and the right honourable member for Richmond  (Mr Anthony)  in the House of Representatives- portrayed to the Western Australians a terrifying picture of a Liberal-Country Party national explosion and therefore ordered their immature western followers to cease playing with detonators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people appointed to it must be prepared to work hard and long to ensure that the impetus gained in establishing the site for the new house is not lost, and that the Austraiian nation can look forward to a building which reflects its national pride and the paramount importance we attach to the role and traditions of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole matter has been an exercise in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision is being made exclusive so as to ringbark the State Supreme Courts and so the great panjandrum down below thinks he is going to have a judicial umbrella in a comprehensive Federal court and that that will create a judiciary that will interpret his laws according to social <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say that in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> no government is above its people and yet this Government wants to be above its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we find that the Opposition is incapable of even expressing a coherent point of view on the question of the reassembly of the Senate, we believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is in a very parlous condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Steele  Hall has been told more than once, and as he ought to know by now, Western Germany, for example, which is held to be a great example of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, a most advanced <span class="highlight">democracy</span> with good leadership, has such a law in existence at the present dme, and the effects on industry are certainly much more stringent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is in accord with the principles on which our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In closing my comments I say that, notwithstanding the arguments one way or the other that will apply in this debate, this is a sad day for the Senate, for the Parliament and for Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no greater blow to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than the admission of any right of the Executive to hamper, hinder or restrain members of this House from carrying out their duty to the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this matter we, the Government, are acting according to principles of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which have always- until today- been preached by our opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The citizen’s right to information is, according to Ralph Nader, the currency of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jim Spigelman’s  Secrecy  shows that in Australia the currency of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being systematically withheld from the private citizen and, more often than not, from thc Government backbencher and the entire Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the Public Service is undermined it is of no use talking about parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because it would be a shell without an honest, effective and impartial Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it becomes a matter of urgency that the principle of the supremacy of Parliament in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and the respect due to it, should be asserted, and that public servants should- equally with members of the Cabinet- clearly recognise, and if necessary be made to recognise that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That maxim would be well served by resolute action by the Senate of a kind which will manifest to public officials generally that, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the institution of Parliament is still paramount: that Cabinet derives what powers it may have from the Parliament, and not Parliament from the Cabinet; and that Parliament’s rights are, in essence, the rights of the citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was rage about that leading to the refusal of Supply, an action which was once described in the Liberal Party as a denial of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the whim of the Senate is to be the basis determining whether a person can ask questions placed on notice it will be a complete denial of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that should operate in a parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the rights of all members of this Parliament, regardless of party, have to be protected if <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of no more degrading principle in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than the one mouthed by the Prime Minister and repeated in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not make for true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have on the one hand a campaign funded by the major commercial enterprises in this country and on the other hand a campaign funded by trade unions and ordinary people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know well that there is no reality or <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a situation in which one man has the money to put an introductory card into a letter box and his rival has the money to saturate television and radio with advertisements giving his name over and over again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the experiences of the last 2 elections, if this Parliament ignores the position, if it allows this dangerous situation to continue whereby <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is made ridiculous by the inability of individual candidates to match the machines and the hysteria of Party machines becomes even more overpowering, then it will in retrospect look ludicrous and ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there could be any greater humbug than to hear people on the opposite side of the chamber talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A great bogy has been built up in recent years- I suspect mainly for political purposes- that multinational corporations are menaces which threaten the very existence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was significant too that during the whole of the speech the Leader of the Opposition- this man who claims to be upholding the fortress of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia- only one pressman at any one time was in the Press gallery, and that it attracted from his colleagues on that side of the House only one of the proverbial parliamentary ‘Hear hears’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the overall inflation pattern, we know that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- and I use that word in a fairly broad sense- the greatest problem, unless it is in wartime, is to get the entire population to accept the various imposts, and that is particularly so in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If indeed it is the story of the inevitableand that may be somewhat simplistic- it is the province of government in a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to ensure that that inevitability comes about not in weeks, months or years, but in the process of decades- indeed, of centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Baits, like many silly Liberals, constantly equate social <span class="highlight">democracy</span> with communism, they may suggest to the more ignorant social democrats that this is only right and proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, they endeavour to disrupt the economy basis of Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is inseparable from <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and why, to be true to itself it must work through a government responsible to a universally elected assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we gather to ourselves a sense of purpose, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country will find itself without support of the people outside, who through their misunderstanding of the mismanagement that takes place in this place, still have confidence in the institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for  Senator Wright  to suggest yesterday of all days that the absence of the Press and the standard of the Press was creating a danger to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country was, I really think, a bit rich, especially as yesterday was the day on which we saw what the Premier of Queensland and his Government did to the democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was front page news and it should be front page news because what was done yesterday to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was worthy of reporting whereas what  Senator Wright  and 1 say probably is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows from that principle that it would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if, on any matter of Government policy approved by the House of Representatives, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubting that the refusal of supply- that is what is hinted; do not let us hide our lights under a bushel- breaches the parliamentary system about which  Senator Wright  has so much to say and is contrary to the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to say to  Senator Wright  that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the opposite of tyranny and oppression and to give way in this instance would be tyranny in its worst form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When all is said and done, the working of the Parliament comes back to the basis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which is the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under a Labor government with its participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, we are all herded together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is denial of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a travesty of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable senators to remember that it is those sorts of things which all of a sudden start the downturn and the rape of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the Government is mounting a campaign in an attempt to show that somehow or other the Senate has brought <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia into disrepute because of its treatment of the Government’s so-called electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any group of people, whether on the Right or the Left, which tries to subvert parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by going around the proper way of the ballot box ought to be condemned very roundly by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Liberal Party which caused the sinking of the Lawson electorate but that did not in any way affect parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are treated by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  to a rather blase, off-the-cuff, throw-away laugh about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and morals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me rather sad that people of our ages come here and legislate to give the vote to 18- year-olds and then set them that sort of example, with glib talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and morals and about people’s involvement in the government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems rather banal now to talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and what has happened to it, but when people are appointed to the Senate at the whim of a State Premier rather than by means of the votes of the people in that State being followed it makes <span class="highlight">democracy</span> look rather sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relative to the continuity and development of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must surely be, basically, the electoral system, the electoral laws and, indeed, the distribution of electorates under which that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point I was trying to make,  Senator Chaney,  for the benefit of people like yourself is that it is not really relevant to recite what happened for many years in various States such as New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia in trying to decide what the great Senate to which we all belong should do in 1975; what it should decide about the future of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia; and what it should decide about fairness in electoral matters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In another article in the Melbourne  Age  newspaper of 13 February this year under the title, ‘<span class="highlight">Democracy</span> gets a shake-up- Federal redistribution a step towards ending gerrymanders ‘, the author said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But once again one beats the air in this extraordinary chamber about questions which are of concern particularly to young people in this country and to people who are seeking a solution, seeking, if you like, an ideal in which to believe in terms of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate, which, as I said, is being conducted in a mood of perhaps cynicism and is boring to people like myself because we have been through it so often before, is nonetheless very important to the future of Australia and to the future of people who are concerned that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should survive, produce and flourish in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in view of the criticism of  Sir Charles  Court he would arrange for leave of absence for  Senator Carrick  to enable him to finish his paper on federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was rather delightfully surprised to read in yesterday’s  West Australian  a letter from a  Mr Michael  Beech who appears to be one of the few members of the Liberal Party who apparently want to uphold the traditions of Australian parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that it would be manifest to the public that the reason why certain events have occurred in the past couple of days is that the Prime Minister of this country, in accordance with the highest tradition of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, insisted that a Minister who had misled the Parliament should pay the fullest penalty for such action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been searching for an issue on which to try to justify the breaking of probably the last convention insofar as parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable senators opposite that as a result of what they have in mind the civilised political contest, which is the only basis of the preservation of democratic government based on a reasonable consensus, will disappear and that the rules of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the contest in the framework of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be taken out of the Parliament into the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is about to take the final step- a step which could well spell out the end of political stability and, regrettably, political <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the Government went to the people and got a majority of votes, the Senate upheld its right above the people and above <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To attempt to prevent the people exercising this judgment is a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last week did we talk about the institution of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, its importance and the enlargement of the opportunities for Australian people to take part in political life when we debated the question of the redistribution of electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They all stood up and said: ‘Look, in the 1930s the Labor Party did this in Queensland, and in the 1940s the Labor Party did this in New South Wales, and the Liberal Party might have done it in South Australia’, as if that was relevant to the sort of question of principle about which people concerned with the survival of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia ought to be bothered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say now, as I said in those debates, that if parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to survive in this country it must not only be seen to work but also must be fair and be seen to be fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It follows from this principle that it would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if on any matter of government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the accepted true fundamental convention of the Westminster system of responsible government that if a government cannot secure the approval of the Parliament of its Budget or money proposals with which to carry on the government, then the monarch is so advised and one of 2 consequences ensues: Either the monarch or the monarch ‘s representative calls upon another member of the Parliament to form a government in the belief that that new government will secure the approval of its Budget or monetary proposals; or the defeated Prime Minister is given the right to have an election and, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to let the people make the final decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no principle involved; it is basically this fundamental question in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>: Shall the people have an opportunity to judge and shall we abide by the decision of those who are the masters of us all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One needs only to look back at the last great depression which began in 1929 to see how, as a result of that great depression and how as a result of the fact that certain persons took advantage of the disorders which were created by that depression to push their own narrow interests, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was destroyed in a great many countries throughout Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an irony for  Senator Greenwood  to talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> being determined by the vote of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the most emotional manner he talks of threats to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the importance of stable government, and I agree with him on that because at this moment <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is threatened in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He and he alone is attempting to destroy <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, because the Opposition in the Senate has done nothing more than seek an expression of the people’s will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be remembered that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not the provision of an absolute licence to a Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate will not retreat before this onslaught on the powers of the Parliament because the Senate is fighting for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators opposite were responsible, if they were a party of moralists, if they agreed with the Constitution and if they wanted to preserve parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> they would have regard for that situation to which I have referred and denounce it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is amazing to me that the great advocates of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> over the years, the people who challenged all the new revolutionary movements in other parts of the world and talked about the Red thrust from South East Asia, from Saigon, about the danger to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and about the great powers of the trade unions, should now seek to use a power which is badly based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The propositions contained in the amendment mean nothing to me but deception- the use of words to try to convey to the people that the Opposition is not seeking power but that it wants parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no question that the rather militant speeches in this place by some of my colleagues about the threat to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> point to a very real situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our job to worry about parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to see that the institutions of the Parliament are respected and preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Opposition has done anything to preserve the idea of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The power exists, and because this Government is the worst government since Federation, because it is dishonest, because it is disastrously inefficient, because it has brought this country to the edge of economic chaos, the Senate Opposition, in company with the Opposition in the House of Representatives, is using the means and the responsibility provided for it in the Constitution to do one thing and one thing alone, that is, to ask the people of Australia to judge whether this is a good or a bad government- who shall deny it the right to do this in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for a government to try to insulate itself against the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The test of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second allegation that needs to be analysed runs something like this: The money power in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ought not to lie in an upper House; that if it does, the evolution of the Westminster system suggests that it ought not to and the only reason it still lies in our Constitution is that we have not got around to amending the power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to believe also that the people who helped put this Government into office are those from Europe who thought parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would work here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, a Greek friend of mine last week said that our country was supposed to be the home of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but we have seen the parliamentary system prostituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition likes to have those idiots to make up their numbers, that is a pretty poor attitude to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition know in their hearts when they talk about the ballot box and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we do not have a democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To talk of a breakdown of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the present Government has developed to an alarming degree both of those components for a breakdown of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would remind the Prime Minister, although he already acknowledges it, that in this country the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that we have at the head a monarch, that we have 2 Houses of Parliament, and that a Bill cannot be enacted unless it passes through both Houses of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no danger to true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when the people have a right to use the processes that are in their own Constitution to deal with this very situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were drowned out by the number of supporters of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> who came along and said:  Fraser should not be doing what he is doing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not about political convention or constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not inciting revolution; we are looking for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country because we are one of the few democratic nations left in a world that is torn with strife at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are one of the few democratic nations that in actual fact can hold its head up- or could until last week- and say: ‘We are a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we believe that every person in this country has the right to vote on issues’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see it as rape, pure and simple- rape of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, rape of the people of Australia- and the Opposition’s attitude is that of the rapist who argues that any damage that is done is caused by the resistance of the victim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has said on a number of occasions that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a fragile plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if that is the circumstance then there is no challenge to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in that circumstance the fragile plant of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will survive- but only in that circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government in this country, as in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, has to be judged on its performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament becomes unworkable by destruction of convention, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself becomes unworkable because <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rests much more on adherence to convention than to the rigid application of rules and laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself, the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the rights or privileges of minorities, then Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the threat to the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not only a threat to the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it, it is a threat to the federal situation as we know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has the hide to do it in the name of preserving <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the ultimate in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was referring to some previous issues in the evolution of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>-  the people’s control of the Executive and the moneys raised and spent by the Executive through the people ‘s control of the lower House, the people’s House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxpayers’ control over their money through their elected representatives in the people’s House is the foundation of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> lies very simply in the answer to the question: Who controls the purse strings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in our Western civilisation was the result of a demand that those who finance a government have a say in the disbursement of that finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concurrent with that right, that privilege of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, there is the responsibility of all elected members to take upon themselves the task of surveying government expenditure, deciding whether the Government is acting as it should, and whether that power of the purse is being exercised as it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be of concern to all who want stable government, who worry about the future planning and development of this country and who worry about the preservation of the parliamentary system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will join the few extremists present on both sides of politics in this country who do not believe in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying before  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack interrupted me, in fact there are people in this country who are extremists, people who, unlike those of us here, do not believe in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good me and others on this side of the chamber who believe in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> saying to these people: ‘Look, this is a one-off situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing for which I do not care one little bit is this rubbish that is being fed out by honourable senators opposite about the challenge to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, about violence and about riots in the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one ofthe most firmly established principles of British Parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that a House of Review should not reject the financial decisions of the popular House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The argument of  Mr Killen  was based, as was that of  Sir Robert  Menzies, on the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> underlying the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much is at stake in the interests of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of resolving these matters by the ballot box, I hoped that  Senator Greenwood  would have adopted a genuinely democratic attitude on the question of electoral redistribution when this Government was trying to bring in legislation which would create genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the ballot box in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a significant minority feels that the democratic processes are so loaded against them that they can never be successful, then that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has in store a dangerous and difficult time in which great tolerance and understanding would be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> they must be withstood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition’s attitude towards the rest of the Government’s legislation in the intervening period has indicated that it is on a course to make parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> unworkable in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the normal sequence of events, without creating the conditions which now have placed parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in peril and without creating the public furore and concern that exists now within the Australian community, the Opposition would now, according to its judgment, be ready to assume the political and economic management of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is denying a right of government which has been written about by all of the legal and constitutional writers and all of the defenders of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Falsification of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a falsification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if, on any matter of government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people, could reverse the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be absurd, as a denial of popular <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask for leave of the Senate to lay on the table a document signed by 262 citizens of Australia calling on the Senate to withdraw its threat to reject the Budget and expressing the view that any other action by the Senate could endanger the future of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the distinguishing features of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the absolute rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think we ought to have regard to that in this place where we are safeguarding <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where we are exercising our proper rights and responsibilities and where we would be totally negligent were we not to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to have the  president  of a political party privy to Budget Speech detail some 6 hours before its presentation is, to say the least, one of the most disgraceful and reprehensible pieces of behaviour of any government in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for quite a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The longer that this constitutional crisis persists the deeper and more permanent will be the wounds that it inflicts on the fragile system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I have said and what other speakers on this side of the Senate have said throughout this crisis: The issue is not the economy; the issue is the survival of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is certainly stretching all of the known concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to suggest that this is a House which is as representative of the will of the people as is the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why has this preferential treatment been given in the releasing of the Budget Papers in this age of what the present Government has been pleased to describe as participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are prepared to refuse the granting of Supply we are creating a breakdown in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to be the only acceptable form of government for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many who have been troubled by social injustices in the community have questioned the ability of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to remedy them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the denial of Supply were allowed to lead to the displacement of the Government the number of doubters of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would increase alarmingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> requires political parties to do more than exact their constitutional pound of flesh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It requires restraint so as to comply with the basic assumptions and practices that make <span class="highlight">democracy</span> workable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the difference between the 2 systems of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and totalitarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am one of those who values greatly indeed the blessings which have been bestowed upon me, upon other honourable gentlemen and upon the Australian community by the system of” <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is now at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now again, in their craving for power, in their addiction to a Cassius Clay philosophy of greater than thou, they have turned aside the long, well established, well understood, accepted and acclaimed standards of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of the matter is whether we like it or not- quite frankly, I do not like saying it- if the late  Senator Milliner  were alive today, and he passed away a mere 3 months ago, the Opposition would not be able to conduct itself as it is conducting itself today in challenging the convention of elective parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by moving its amendment for deferral of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of the Opposition polarised and divided this great nation and the Australian people in respect of Vietnam when they were in office, so too are they now polarising the people and the Australian nation by their tearing up of the long established principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the conventions which bring about stability and confidence within a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making provision for that basis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, those conventions also provide for the protection of the rights of the Opposition and for the protection of the rights of minority sections in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is they who are depriving the people of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to be practical about things, when we listen to the waffle coming from the other side of the chamber we must say that it is a very sad day for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament becomes unworkable by destruction of convention, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself becomes unworkable because <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rests much more on adherence to convention than to the rigid application of rules and laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to quote the contents of this letter because I believe for the sake of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it also ought to appear in the  Hansard  record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the tradition., the mythology of the Liberal Party as the upholder of convention in Australia and the upholder of enlightened conservatism, of alternative policies and of addiction to principle and to fair play in order that the parliamentary system might survive as the basic institution of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as we know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not wish to go into the rather turgid details with which we have dealt previously in the Senate concerning the Liberal Party’s failure to comply with the great conventions of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner some of the more liberal members in  Mr Fraser’s  Party stand up to him and say: ‘This far, no further’, the sooner <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will be allowed to go on and the Government to get down to the job, the economy to be brought back into its proper perspective and the Australian people to see the further results of Labor legislation flow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament becomes unworkable by destruction of convention, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself becomes unworkable because <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rests much more on adherence to convention than to the rigid application  of rules  and laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself, the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the rights or privileges of minorities, then Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that when the issue is whether the Opposition will act in the manner in which it has acted by denying Supply? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply an issue which will ultimately have to be determined, as are all political issues in this <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, at the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it is certainly stretching all of the known concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to suggest that this is a House which is as representative of the will of the people as is the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be bold of me to assert that this has happened only on the other side of the chamber but I do think it has been unhelpful to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia that there has been an attempt to justify positions on the basis of principle when in part those stances are based on politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At those times the people always used phrases, such as they claimed to be acting in the interests of the people; they were responding to the call of the nation; or they were acting in defence of the best interests of the people and in defence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been properly said that whilst a government is prepared to face the people- its masters- then and then only is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> safe; then and then only is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> not at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that one of the reasons for our downfall, apart from being the victims of one of the most gruesome conspiracies in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, is that our opponents were able to portray us as enemies of business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want honourable senators on the Government side to ponder seriously these events because I believe that those honourable senators are as interested as we are in seeing the preservation of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country- a system whereby men and women are elected to come to this Parliament to speak on behalf of their constituents and whereby the party with the greatest number of people elected to the floor of the House of Representatives forms the constitutionally elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each and every member of the Government and of the Opposition- all members of this Parliament- who believe in the principle of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the principle that the majority should exercise the rule with the protection of the rights of the minority have to see that the events which took place on 1 1 November last never occur again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am honestly and firmly of the opinion that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia suffered a great blow with the events of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say again that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was struck a very heavy blow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude by saying what I said earlier Parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia has received a great setback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed I think at that time what we saw was <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That shows that the Opposition believes that majority rule is parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which is not so because majority rule simply means that the guy with the biggest gang is calling the tune. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was greatly shaken as a result of the events of 11 November and 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it most extraordinary that we should be concerning ourselves today and over this last week with Opposition efforts in this chamber to assert that the action of the Senate was a threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the action of the GovernorGeneral, as the ultimate force in the constitutional set-up of this country, was in some measure a threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to be retained in this country there must be the circumstance when a government can be forced to ask the people whether it should continue on the lines that it proposes or whether it should be displaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that such an election was forced is surely the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are still being belaboured in this chamber by suggestions that on 1 1 November <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was dealt a terrible blow by the then Opposition through the Senate and through the ultimate decision of the GovernorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall Patrick White at that time saying of the events of 1 1 November that although there was no tanks, no troops around and no guns he felt that there was something sinister for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could there be sinister for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a circumstance in the operation of a constitution, which saw the Australian people given the opportunity to go thoughtfully, responsibly and quietly to cast their vote in secret ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no threat or challenge to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that remains the province of the Australian people I believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country is secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to work with the people to create an Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the role of government must be to establish in Australia a climate in which the basic facets of Australian free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can survive, evolve and grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is this free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there are many basic facets of free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention one other facet of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Speech suggests, it must remain the servant of the people and only then will <span class="highlight">democracy</span> survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that situation a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as we propose and such as we have developed cannot survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We cannot afford it financially and it does not fit into <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I felt sad on behalf not only of myself but also of the people throughout Australia who believed that they lived in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> died on November 1 1 last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia is not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to stop believing that it is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rememberance Day of 1976 and of every year thereafter will be the day on which free-thinking Australians will bow their heads for the customary 2 minutes silence, not for those who died in the great wars but for the death of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the only way that we can restore and maintain a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how the honourable senator can sustain an argument of that type when the people of Australia, many of whom voted for the Australian Labor Party in May 1 974, decided in December last that it was time to return to true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and gave the Liberal-National Country Party resounding support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It first happened when Charles I .sacked the reigning Prime Minister, which was the start of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has to be said and certainly what the newly-elected senators have to learn is that what one says in this place has very little relevance, very little value, in terms of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in terms of one’s contribution to the maintenance of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in terms of one’s understanding of the way in which our society operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a dangerous step that was taken, and it was a step that did more to damage the fabric of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country than 50 years of propaganda by any revolutionary group at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been my belief that the maintenance of the family as a basic unit of society is essential to our way of life in our Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier in my speech- I also said it some 20 months ago in my maiden speech in the Senate- I believe that the most important issue which confronts any government in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the 1970s is the capacity to understand and manage the sorts of changes which are taking place in our society and in the world at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has to be said and certainly what the newlyelected senators have to learn is that what one says in this place has very little relevance, very little value, in terms of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in terms of one’s contribution to the maintenance of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in terms of one’s understanding of the way in which our society operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I heard of their speeches, I do not think that the new senators were wasting their time and I believe that together we will see whether the power can be restored to the people through the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideally, in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> power should be exercised in consultation and cooperation with elective organisations within the community, in preserving the integrity of institutions within society and in recognising that power should be kept close to the people and not manipulated by the corporate State method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are we doing for other institutions in these countries to foster the ideals of grass-roots <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and so much for the redistribution Bill which was not passed because the then Opposition in the Senate would not pass it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was a great lesson in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have that Bill refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have told the people of Australia more strongly and more often that if they valued <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a way of life they should look very closely at whatever moves the people who now form the Government take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has seen the working of the Constitution, the recent opportunity which Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> had to give expression to its purpose, the people round the country - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has had an opportunity to express its purpose of the Crown and of the Parliament pivoted on the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the American Parliament has done a great service to the people of the world who believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by examining the actions of the Central Intelligence Agency and in revealing the kinds of activities in which that organisation has been involved in the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because ASIO indulged in activities which lowered the standing of the intelligence service in the eyes of the Australian people, particularly in the eyes of those Australians who care very much about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the rights of the individual, that an investigation and reform of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CIA has been built up by the denigrators of America as one of the nasty organisations which in some way is regarded as a threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried to explain that it was very doubtful that this would happen in a country like Australia where we have known <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and where it is respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, with regard to the present unjust and inequitable electoral system which operates in Australia, one finds the Government uninterested in reform, reform which is necessary in order to guarantee the future viability of Australian parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the electoral process does not properly reflect the commitments of the voters but rather frustrates them, then it can only serve to bring the entire concept of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country into disrepute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It becomes even more vital, therefore, to state that reform of the existing electoral machinery, together with other iniquities which mar Australian political <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, should occupy a higher priority for any administration which is honestly concerned with Australia’s future as a democratic country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sorry state of so-called <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia when the deposed Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  is unable to speak about the detail that surrounded the negotiations, or whatever, which involved the downfall of his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a so-called <span class="highlight">democracy</span> yet, despite the action that has been taken, no reasons have been given for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not my conception of the operation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope that it will reverse that trend because any emphasis on an extension of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which were the brave new words in the Governor-General’s Speech, in this era, or whatever it is called, will be simply nothing- it will be ashes- if it is not accompanied by the opening up of government and a participation by people instead of the Government ruling them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result is that there will be an early general election for both Houses and the people can do what, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as ours, is their responsibility and duty and theirs alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the ultimate paradox that the less developed countries reject and denigrate the system of one man one vote in their own countries but they demand and exploit the right of one state one vote in the General Assembly because they do not understand <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’s ground rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much of what has been achieved in the period since the 1939-45 war finished in the way of ensuring that Australians became a nation of home owners- a nationwide property owning <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- has been due to the policies which the Liberal and Country Party governments followed in the years when they were in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we can ever get this Government to be generous enough, when an attack is made on parties or individuals, at least to give an opportunity for someone to reply without the Government’s taking up the whole of the time available by using its numbers and thus showing that there is a lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the Senate and an inability for an Opposition to present its case, I look forward to an opportunity to reply and show the association between the court activity and the words of  Senator Harradine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, we have compulsory voting in Australia and, in the best traditions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, it is assumed that every Australian over the age of 1 8 has listened to the political debate that has taken place over an election period, has assessed the political issues and has made a selection, on an alternative basis, of his choice of candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is much more to be done before we as a nation can rightly say that real <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government places the very highest priority on bringing some long overdue representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that, by introducing a system which will apply uniformly to employee and employer organisations and under which a ballot will be conducted by the Electoral Office so that every unionist will have the opportunity to vote, there will be the opportunity for representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in union affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wonder why it is that members of the Australian Labor Party are so concerned about the efforts of the present Government to give an industrial representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to members of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What attitude did members of the previous Government take to the Baltic States- an end to freedom; an end to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; an end to selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which the people elect the government or is it sufficient for  Mr Rupert  Murdoch to decide which Party will form the government by giving $64,000 to the Labor Party in 1 972 when it became the government and by not giving that amount to it in 1975 but giving a greater amount to the Liberal Party of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen that on every occasion when there was a threat to the Establishment we have had some semi-military organisations formed, to use force if necessary, to stop the continuation of the progress of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do raise doubts about the underlying philosophy that $5 in the pocket is more important than community services which a government can provide in the context of a modern <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the late 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will also seek to further our own deeply held values of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, freedom and respect for the individual at every opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man encouraged the invasion of a country which, for the first time in its contemporary history- since 25 April 1974- had the opportunity to enjoy some of the fruits of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and self-determination and to run its own affairs free of the colonial overlord that had held sway in the region for some 400 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously the union ballots is related to the question of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to the collegiate system I make the general observation that it seems to me only reasonable that in order properly to obtain <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in unions there should be only one tier between the individual member of a union and the final election to Federal leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are arguments based on rank and file control and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and also on federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Information disseminated on persecution for convictions, the breaches of human rights and on the truthful character of the Soviet <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the whole, which continuously is directed towards public opinion by the members of the movement for civil rights in the U.S.S.R., has, it seems, begun to reach the awareness of wide groups of the Western society, and has even shown influence on the tactics applied by some Western political parties.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when a demonstration develops into a situation where the demonstrators attempt to take away the right of people to speak to others, to have access to public places- the campuses are public places- and to address people of different political views or different attitudes, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is imperilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> ought not to be imperilled by those actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time the Opposition realised that, unless we in Australia have voted out socialism once and for all and have shown that our country has full confidence in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the people of Australia will lose the freedom they have taken for granted for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us realise that it is only in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that free trade unions exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Democratic socialism is the euphoric passing state from <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also realise that the right of a union to strike is the prerogative of a free trade union movement in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not that of a socialist country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Demonstrations like the one we saw last Monday against the elected Prime Minister of the country where, according to the newspapers there were 1000 demonstrators- the nucleus from outside the University- where violence of the type reported occurred; where a brick was thrown through the glass doors causing flying glass to hit the face of Sergeant Barry Carpenter; where  Mr Fraser  ‘s Assistant Press Secretary was kicked; where  Mr Fraser  was spat upon and his car kicked and thumped yet no arrests were made, are no longer the prerogative of any person living in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have lost their <span class="highlight">democracy</span> through lethargy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had pointed out that only in a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> were demonstrations considered a right of the people; only in a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> were trade union strikes considered a right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After ail, the private sector is a traditional area in a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and that is what Australia has been throughout its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So there is a recognition that if we are to have <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we must have the associations and the organisations that can influence the daily lives of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was explained to me in West Germany, nowhere is the importance of social democrats to the continued viability of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> more in evidence than in Portugal today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those countries where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is strongest are countries in which fraternal parties of the Australian Labor Party, parties affiliated with the socialist internationale, are either in government or have been in government for very long periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to turn back the clock and to say that that no longer is to be the case and that it will be the law of the jungle once again, Australia will be placed in the same sort of situation as that which produced the upheaval which destroyed <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What destroyed <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s was the unemployment and the deprivation which the great masses of the people were suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will hammer another nail in the coffin of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which already has been badly damaged by the disgraceful events that occurred last year in this Parliament and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will be aware of statements made by the GovernorGeneral,  Sir John  Kerr, at the annual congress of the Returned Services League earlier this week to the effect that certain forces were trying to destroy notions of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> among the young and were campaigning to convert students to political ideologies that ran against our traditional system of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are forces at work in society today aimed directly at young people, which are calculated to influence in a fashion adverse to our traditional system of freedom and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and adverse to our normal methods of democratic discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole purpose of Parliament is to express the views of society in terms of a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which people can come together in freedom of association and freedom of expression, without any fear of intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a world in which violence, intimidation, tyranny and torture are growing each day and in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is shrinking, we do not need people inciting violence; we need a bipartisan approach in this Senate and in another place to support these principles to our back teeth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>India, this great country, has been the example which democrats throughout the world have been able to quote to those who have said that it is only a few rich people in Sweden, New Zealand, Canada or Switzerland who can afford to have the parliamentary democratic system and that as long as there are real economic and communal difficulties <span class="highlight">democracy</span> does not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past year, since 26 June 1975 when the emergency was proclaimed by the Indian Government, I believe it is becoming increasingly the case that one can no longer make the same boast about Indian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that one could make previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As has been seen in other countries, once you start off on the road of taking away the constitutional rights of people by whittling down <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is usually an unending process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that we should engage in violent abuse of India, but I believe that members of this Parliament, by whatever means they have available, should make it clear to the Indian Government and its representatives that we are disturbed about what is happening there; that we are alarmed by the fact that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> appears to be in the process of being destroyed in India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is important that those of us who live in a part of the world where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> continues should be making a lot of noiseconstructive noise- and getting in touch with India and other countries in which this retreat from <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the past 10 years or so I believe the role of the Parliament has been substantially lifted by the Senate, in the Australian parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which respects the rights of individuals and the rule of law it is vital that there should be no suggestion that political pressures can be used to influence the conduct of the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I would just like to say that it is usual for  Senator Keeffe  and other Queensland Labor senators in debates on matters involving the Queensland Government to make snide references to the Premier, some of the ministers or some of the Liberal Party and National Party members of the Parliament and suggest that there is now a lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or freedom or something or other in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me conclude this part of my speech by saying that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Queensland seems to be operating very vigorously indeed and this was particularly evident in an election held not long ago when the Labor Party was decimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But again the forces of right prevailed and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> people have liberty and freedom but freedom brings with it responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what the Minister said because I think it is of fundamental importance that the people of Australia and honourable senators on the other side of the chamber understand that the spurious attempts by the trade unions to fine people for legitimately offering themselves to an employer for work is a complete negation of the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and civil liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a dangerous situation in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you will appreciate,  Mr President,  it is necessary to preface my submissions by making an appeal for the reintroduction of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sat on a Committee for a few months with some very capable parliamentarians- representative  Dr Harry  Jenkins and  Sir Magnus  Cormack, among others- and we got a massive report about parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even  Mr Speaker  Snedden has referred to the need for parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who may not always have a high opinion of the concept of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> said to me in relation to that subject: ‘At least you got an answer,  Senator’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a brief 2 weeks it looked as though <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would come to the people of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this represents a grave threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when law abiding citizens are given no area for discussion excepting in a court of law at which they have to pay their costs, only to be denied their rights to hear the Magistrate ‘s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something of a  cliche  in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to say that people should have equality under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this  cliche  was not realised in this <span class="highlight">democracy</span> until the Whitlam Government took steps to realise it by setting up the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that that is why the present Government was not prepared to let <span class="highlight">democracy</span> prevail and put those Bills to a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the authorities who have analysed the situation from a constitutional point of view, such as Professor O ‘Connell,  Dr Forcey  and Professor Richardson, citing such authorities as  Mr Justice  Dixon for the right of the Senate to reject Bills with a consequent dissolution of the Parliament, bring home to the people of Australia how useful it is in this <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have a mechanism in the Senate with the power to reject a money Bill such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that whatever we decide on this side of the House is a political decision, as though that was not a political decision to strike a very serious blow at parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country to create in the minds of a lot of people, after years of propaganda by those who might have had revolutionary concepts, a lack of faith in the parliamentary processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Executive Government of any nation is all, there is no <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, there is a dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to 2 meetings to be held in Adelaide next week- one at the Adelaide Town Hall and the other at the Norwood Town Hall- on the subject of last year’s constitutional crisis and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it to be conducted by the tribunal which is to be established or is it to be an independent public inquiry as it would be in any other <span class="highlight">democracy</span> comparable to this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been introduced both in the House of Representatives and the Senate, accompanied by a great deal of noisy rhetoric about the desirability of having <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secret ballot legislation which was introduced in June of this year, poorly drawn up as it was, was put forward as another example of the Government’s intention and concern to introduce a greater degree of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into the affairs of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share the Minister’s view about the desirability of the highest level of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that there should be <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions to the utmost possible degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions I think it is very important that we should try to put a little substance in to the rhetoric, a little flesh on the bones of the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Prime Minister  (Mr Fraser)  who was then the Liberal Party spokesman on industrial relations, acknowledged the commitment to industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which was in our 1973 legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Government’s action in ensuring that such a system is retained reveals the emptiness of its commitment to internal trade union <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s commitment to industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as shown by this legislation is nothing more than a sham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred as being empty rhetoric references to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to the minority interests, to the involvement of the mass of the people in the establishment of those who represent them, whether it be in a union, some other organisation or association or in the Parliament itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he had forgotten involvement that he has expressed from time to time with the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button suggested later when he approved of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the methods and philosophy of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that management should reflect the rank and file views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficult proposition is to answer that question, to find the best method by which a measure of real <span class="highlight">democracy</span> can be called upon to result in the election of those people whom the great mass of the unionists require to lead them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seem to think, as I look at this legislation and as I listen to the opposition to it from the Australian Labor Party in the chamber tonight, that it highlights a problem which I believe is basic to the problems which confront Australians and certainly to the problems that confront parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say in reference to those thoughts that probably the American circumstance fills considerable numbers of Australians with a measure of envy, for it does appear that there is not the sort of vast ideological gap between the major political entities in that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cameron legislation in 1973 contained two very substantial measures of progress towards full <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these measures constituted major progress in increasing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the unions but in its union bashing campaign in 1975 and 1976 the coalition chose to deceive the public about the effects of the Cameron legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the media together with the coalition parties succeeded in confusing the general public who I think did come to believe that there was no provision for rank and file voting in union rules and that the Cameron legislation had not made any progress towards <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth drawing the attention of honourable senators and any other people who may be listening to this debate to the numerous undertakings given by coalition spokespersons to establish <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Events over recent years have emphasised the very basis of trade union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not continue with these quotations, although I could continue for quite a long time as these promises were made so often; but I ask honourable senators to note that in the promises made by the Prime Minister and by  Mr Street  there is an emphasis on postal voting as being the essential element in introducing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be suggested that postal voting is more important even than rank and file voting in order to ensure <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For months the Government talked about the importance of establishing postal ballots and how <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would be achieved by imposing postal ballots on the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I hope I am making clearly- I think there was some confusion about this in the debate last night- is that by allowing for the collegiate system to be perpetuated the Government also is allowing unions not to have postal ballots; that is, not to have the very system which the Government claimed was essential for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an entirely spurious claim by the Minister, and by anyone else who makes such a claim, that somehow the collegiate system ensures more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than the rank and file system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of all, we in the Opposition oppose this legislation because it is a complete reversal of all the undertakings given by members of the coalition parties during 1975 and 1976 about introducing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> into trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is still not good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to incorporate in  Hansard  a chart which shows the prostitution of trade union <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in relation to the intervention in the Federated Clerks Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to promote <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hear what this great promoter of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in unions has to say about the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we see <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the guise of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the amendments to the Act were moved by  Mr Clyde  Cameron in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us analyse whether or not one system or the other gives true <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might ask: How is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to be upheld in the trade union movement in those circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what did this great democrat of a Minister in the previous Government do to that principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is the action of this person who was quite determined to get, according to his words, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> back into the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is his sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of his political friends that he is seeking; not the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the trade union movement has known and has fought for over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be true <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not something imposed upon the union by the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give you some examples of how this National Civic Council-dominated college denigrates <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I would set out the following facts - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an example of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that exists in this Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clyde Cameron, whatever his weaknesses and however he got on with his Leader, nevertheless tried to get <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in trade unions because its absence was one of his peculiar aversions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine referred to the Bill before the Senate as setting up a more democratic system that will provide a choice for organisations and give more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the rank and file members particularly of the small branches of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, to me, is the personification of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite have spoken at length today about industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is this great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and rank and file participation in the election of the officials of a union that  Senator Hall  is talking about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I am completely mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wartime objective of survival, following the ‘whatever may be ‘ philosophy, is different indeed from the objective in peacetime which is, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, to implement legislation which takes account of human nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remarked earlier- I believe it should not be lost sight of as these matters of centralism and federalism are constantly raised- that there is a tendency in the world today wherever <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and free communities and free parliaments operate, for there to be an increase in federalist concepts as opposed to the centralist concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it can be irksome if somebody does not want to do something that the Government desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I predict- I hope I am proved wrong- that next year will see a further shattering of the consensus without which parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> cannot be conducted, that is, that there will be a confrontation between this Government and the unions in an attempt to make the unions bear the burden of the Government’s errors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also know that the Scandinavian countriesoften regarded as the garden lands of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- have had an ombudsman for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would know that the Committee for <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> in Greece came before the Committee on which I sat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or people’s rights or their right to go to law if they are not provided with the means to go to law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, as we all believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and people’s right to go to law, this Government ought to look at that point very seriously to see what can be done about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did my national service and, had I been old enough, I would have been willing to fight in any of these circumstances to defend <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kilgariff-he talked about that great place of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- that he is one of those who opposed the election of senators for the Northern Territory when the Labor Government proposed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff  endeavoured to point out how the Northern Territory had led the way in Aboriginal affairs and how it was the acme of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is some sort of a triumph for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, even in a period when <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is in grave peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I support the amendment moved by my colleague  Senator Button  which opposes this legislation and proposes to send it back for redrafting after a period of time for proper public inquiry and discussion so that the Government will then come up with legislation which will restructure public broadcasting in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the Australian consumer and all the people involved in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have invited the individual universities to look to their by-laws to ensure that they contain full democratic provisions to enable students to conduct their affairs with full <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and I have suggested that, if some practice is obnoxious, the universities might see whether some kind of opting out can be made available as there is in some trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this development of parliamentary law we were most advantaged by the fact that in the United States of America, that great federal <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the constitution of whose Senate might be looked for more than this item of current events, the Senate of the United States and the courts of the United States have had to deal with the problem of transcendent invasion of the integrity of government in that state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I always think that it is dangerous to the Parliament, to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to the people when matters are rushed through this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and we want the most democratic system to apply to elections for the Federal House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Democracy</span>’ comes from 2 Greek words which mean the power of the people and, therefore, if we believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we will elect a government which truly represents the people, and as near as we can we will elect representatives to represent an equal number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-They are the laws of an organisation, not the laws which relate to the election of representatives to Parliament in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was pure <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we depart from the system to avoid the creation of hardship we will depart from the principle of true representation of the people and will destroy <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor opposes this provision because it represents a destruction of the true meaning of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- the representation of equal numbers of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the famous  Senator Missen  talking about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The linchpin of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is electoral justice and without a delicately and fairly balanced electoral system there cannot be real <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party constantly has advocated reform of Australian electoral laws in order to bring about real <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia in the strict literal sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal job to be carried out in this redistribution so far as the Labor Party is concerned is to ensure real <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by the provision of just, reasonable and sensible electoral boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle should be an essential ingredient in any restoration of confidence in the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are doing our best with this legislation to make sure that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fragmentation of parties under the voting systems of those countries grossly weakened <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has any idea of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would be horribly frightened of what the consequences might be if, as the result of procrastination, people in a State voted for their representatives in that State at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A by-product of that situation would be that people would have a much lower appreciation of Parliament and would ask: Is the concept of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> worthwhile? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would just about end <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country if we had to try to persuade people to vote for- I use New South Wales as an example- about 45 members from 300 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the people who suffer most are the minorities and we can reach a situation where they have no say whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there has always been the proposition that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we cater for minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> you will be all right if you are in the majority but you will not be if you are in the minority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dictionary meaning of the word ‘<span class="highlight">democracy</span>’ usually mentions in part that it is based on the equality of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that it is fair enough for us to talk in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of the equality of representation rather than the equality of voting power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party supports this Bill, as it supported it several years ago, on these bases, and I would like the dissidents to listen to this: If simultaneous elections for both Houses constitute some sort of a threat to the democratic process and to the Senate, why did not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> perish and the Senate wither on the vine in the first 60 years of our federation when elections always were held simultaneously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the greatest threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia is the apathy and the inertia of a large section of this very conservative country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can devote more time to this debate it will be beneficial to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the long run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our system we have a people’s house elected by the people and I think it is an essential requirement of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but it can be turned out of office, sacked at will every 6 months by a State appointed house in this smaller chamber, the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that time ever comes the matter will have to be decided by some method and we will have a fight between <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span>, as we knew it before and as it had survived, is gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really to argue for the destruction of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If you do not have elections, you do not have <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that the power which resides at present in the 2 Houses of this Parliament should be reviewed as frequently as possible and as desirable so that the people in Australia can sit in judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember that the introduction of pensions, workmen’s compensation, universal franchise and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself were all opposed by the sorts of people who are opposing this sensible and proper amendment to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not being introduced because of a desire to improve <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country or for any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no matter what devious means the Prime Minister and his desperate colleagues have for proposing this and the other amendments to the Constitution now, the Labor Party has always believed- it has been in our platform and we stated this in 1974- that the long term results of this and the other proposals will be a more stable political <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments in Australia already have the shortest term of office of governments in any western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as they are elected for 3 years only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard from  Senator Wright  and other honourable senators on his side that the Senate is essential to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, that the written constitution is essential to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country and that the States are essential to our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one in this place is seriously telling us that that is not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time allotted to me in this debate I want to say a few words about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is useful to underline the principles of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia as we know them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To pass premature judgment before the people have had an opportunity to express their views is, I think, not in the best interests of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if that process continued <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia would be harmed because elections would not have the same impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not impressed by people who take an unrealistic view about the things which are really a threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is when Australians become subject to emotion and not reason, and I hope that in the months that precede the vote on these referendums there will be an unemotional and reasonable approach to the problems which confront the people over their most important constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in this country another very great danger to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and I mention this only because  Senator James  McClelland indicated his great fear for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view another enormous threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> lies in the extraordinary and large emotional ideological gap which separates Australians and we of this chamber must do all we can, inside and outside it, to lessen that gap and to lessen the use of emotion in place of reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Every speaker in the debate tonight and earlier today has used the catchcry ‘the protectors of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Had they been accepted they would have decayed <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not strengthened it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting questions to the people for determination is of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in a world where currently in the United Nations there are only 24 democracies amongst 146 represented nations, the remainder of which are either despotisms or totalitarian states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that its importance to the Constitution, to the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of Australia, is very great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That No case was prepared by the Liberal and National Country Parties which now are asking the people to do a total about-face- a 180 degree about-turn- and to support a piece of legislation which in 1 974 was described as deceitful and as a threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to take up the theme that has been emphasised by a number of honourable senators I think that  Senator Wriedt  was the most recent to refer to it in this debate and that  Senator Tehan  was probably the first to refer  to  itthat is, that the sovereign power in the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But ultimately parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia in 1975 was a victim of the lack of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has always been my belief that the maintenance of the family as a basic unit of society is essential to our way of life in our Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statistics which I have quoted in some detail are all the more alarming when we look at them in terms of preserving the family unit as basic to the welfare of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, it seized power by means of fraud, and the Senate might recall that when I spoke at that time I said that I believed parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was imperilled by the actions of Liberals in this place in refusing Supply to Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The passage of this referendum will be good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in this part of the world, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which has been in existence now for nearly 1 50 years and with the experience we have gained, must set some examples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, then it is no wonder that our Government has been swept back into power after only 3 years of socialist paradise! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I always have believed that this Parliament is the focal point of this <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and therefore the higher the standard of this Parliament the better is the democratic standard of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Government is doing a very serious injustice to itself, to the Constitution and to our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by trotting out such somersaulting statements on these questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators think that this is the right type of thing to happen in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always think that the safest <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of all is a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which the most power remains in the hands of the people so that when they vote they have the right to say who they will have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that the words which I have spoken will at least be considered by some people and that on 15 May the Government will get its reply from the people, that is a good solid ‘No thank you, we want to remain as we are, a safe, sound <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we find when that conflagration takes place that the Soviet Union has always been the friend of the Africans and that those people who talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> have been the friends of the Nazis, that will damage us very severely where it hurts us most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we believe the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a system which ought to be defended -400 Australians were killed in Vietnam, allegedly in defence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- we should say that it is not something which ought to be thought of only when a war is actually started, but is also a policy which ought to be actively pursued at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Han  Suyin writes articles one day saying how Madam Chiang Ching is bringing about a new type of socialism and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because she is a guide of the cultural revolution and then a week later she writes in  Scope  that this is in fact not the case and that Madam Chiang Ching and 3 others were all members of the Gang of Four who were plotting to restore capitalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regardless of whether one supports Fernandes or the Congress Party the election result is certainly a great turnaround from the position we saw in India and a great victory for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> not only in that part of Asia but throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we must ask ourselves in all reality in 1977 whether we can afford to have a song and words like that as a national song in a country with pretensions to being a modern political <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely part of living in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is being able to criticise governments or criticise people in a constructive manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is healthy that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> this happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What concerns me in association with this kind of activity in Australia is that I believe it is not consistent with the preservation in the long run of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the style that we support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This last is most important; genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is impossible without a well-informed electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although that is somewhat derided I make the point that unless profits rise in a reasonable and proper manner it does not matter what sort of society a person lives in, whether a fascist dictatorship, a communist dictatorship, a socialist Utopia- wherever one finds that- or the hardest of all institutions, a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as we have in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When Australia commits itself - whether it be to the Asian Development Fund or to its predecessor, the World Bank- and we cast our bread on these particular waters does it mean, in effect, that money unwittingly can be used to prop up a regime that we would hardly regard as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or a country in which there is brotherhood and unity amongst the citizens of that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make it perfectly clear to honourable senators that the primary responsibility for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the execution of an action of conscience on any campus is that of the governing body- the senate or the council of the university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- and sometimes that word can be put in inverted commas- it is very difficult to marshal and determine priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight is a very sad night for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are a responsible organisation and, as was told to us in November 1975, we have a responsibility to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a responsibility for the democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are preaching that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is on the verge of collapse and allowing the dictatorships of the industrial world and the Arab world to take over will see in this behaviour of the Senate today a demonstration that Parliament is capable of acting promptly when effective action is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that, as one would expect in any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, there is constant discussion about a revision of both the Australian and the American provisions to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That epitomises to me political <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is a very important aspect of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> because, after all, local government or the third tier of government, is at the grass roots level of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are others, of course, such as students of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the development of political systems, who believe that communities ought to be involved and ought to have a responsiblity for the running of their own affairs even if, in fact, that has to be brought about compulsorily, as would be the situation with an elected assembly carrying out municipal and state type functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are facing the kinds of challenges that from time to time <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in itself faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> is very vulnerable to organised force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this as in other matters will win out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of determination by a major trade union movement in a great <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would be, I think, in some measure embarrassing to the Labor Opposition in this country and it would be something that Labor would not want people to be thinking about and discussing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also happens to be head of the Workers <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Unit in the State Government in South Australia, as is well known, and consequently he advises the Premier of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This time that something new is not a new world economic order but a new order where no nation can plunder any other and where ethnic <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is the new order and each group of people runs its own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The internal solution of the problem of political representation to which  Mr Smith  has been referring will, I feel sure, wind up with the concept of ethnic <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which I mentioned previously, where the Matabele run their affairs, the Mashona run theirs and the whites run theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite may say that one of the great problems in a Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that it pays little more than lip service to the concepts of selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to recognise, defend and promote those things that are basic to the society which we have evolved in Australia, the basic cornerstones of a free <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of information has been provided to members of Parliament and I am quite sure that we are all aware of the SOTUFD-the Sixth October Thai United Front For <span class="highlight">Democracy</span>- campaign in Victoria that was started some time ago in an endeavour to bring to the attention both of members of parliament and of parliament themselves that an injustice is being done to a number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think these are reasonable requests when one takes into account that a country that was practising <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for some years finds itself in the position where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is overthrown with no possibility of having it restored in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore join with  Senator Coleman  in saying that I believe that these factors should be very seriously considered by the people of Australia and that we should raise our voices where we can to try to ensure that the people in that country have the proper right of trial even if we cannot do very much about their <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, Britain’s ‘Socialist Generation’, having wreaked so much havoc at home by its passion for levelling, its search for power and by its upper class guilt, ends up by blurring the historical distinction between social <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and marxism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The centrality of this impulse and the incapacity of US technological and material superiority to determine the outcome of the Vietnam war stimulated a deep probing of the theory and practice of  <span class="highlight">democracy</span> ‘ in the imperialist heartlands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a right which is particularly needed in Queensland where the gerrymander is alive and well, and where representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is sorely wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me that is a travesty of justice, a travesty of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which leads to the very thing about which churchmen in Queensland are protesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate to two speeches that  Senator Wheeldon  made in the last year, one on India and the loss of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there, and one on the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are preaching that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is on the verge of collapse and allowing the dictatorships of the industrial world and the Arab world to take over will see in this behaviour of the Senate today a demonstration that Parliament is capable of acting promptly when effective action is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that in every Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> great account is taken of the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can people who talk about parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> argue that that is a good thing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite are also against the provisions which provide for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the industrial community by making it an offence to force individuals to join unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the Government’s brand of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to legislate anything in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the incidence of strikes is any criterion, then the industrial relations system of almost every Western <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not easy in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> even to touch a sacred cow, but I do not quarrel with anybody about the question of national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 priority in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>; but that is all they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every other country of equivalent sophistication and pretentions to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the national broadcasting service is always referred to as the state broadcasting service and the other broadcasting services, here known as the ‘commercials’, are referred to as the independent broadcasting services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mark of the sort of vital <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we hope to be is the independent and free discussion that takes place both in private and on the air waves in Australia- on television and radio- and which is reflected in the media in a variety of ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister consider making a protest to the South African Government against this further blow to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that country and denials of human rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with great respect to every honourable senator that, if we believe in the institution of Parliament, if we believe in the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, if we believe in the election of people’s representatives to the Parliament, we have to devise and evolve a system whereby as much as possible of the deliberations in this place is recorded and transmitted to the public at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not advocating an adoption of the presidential system but I am adverting to it as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which operates without blasting to instability Government control of finance simply because the Congress takes a defective part in the decision as to finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is terribly destructive of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if somebody has to wait for a week or so to know who has won an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it was good for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when well over 12 per cent of the votes were informal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if it is ruled that the only alternative to the defeat of certain Bills in this chamber is the resignation of the government, this places the Senate in the position of a superior force over the people of Australia and is a denial of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> m Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the right under the Standing Orders, he has the right under convention, and it is one of the fundamental bases of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that he should be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when it comes to industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I think that the WWF is a pacesetter in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very basis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is threatened if we have the threat of reprimand hanging over us for the way in which we vote at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the last bastion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- it is usually classified that way- is the churches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an expression which I should imagine has not previously appeared in the legislation of a country with pretentions to being a modern <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition believe that the media itself is one of the most important instruments for preserving <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that in Australia we still have a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that we, both in this chamber and outside it, have stressed constantly the importance of preserving the independence and the objectivity of national broadcasting and of restraining the commercial sector when it acts in a way which is contrary to the public interest and to the interest of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister kept assuring us that our anxiety was totally unjustified because everything would be accessible to the public; that procedures would be established whereby the ultimate expression of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> could take place, in that the public could come and say, ‘We do not like that station, that kind of broadcasting’, that if enough of them said it, in a democratic way, their wishes would be observed and they would be able to bring about change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a disappointment to everyone who believes that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> all citizens should have access to the air waves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have some sensitivity to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as we call it, talk about decisions being taken by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody today would object to sports scores coming from different places, whether it be Bucharest or a western <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement concerned the introduction of socalled industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier, when asked in the State Parliament last year about the objectives of the State Government in this matter, said that there was a list of companies available to the worker participation unit or the worker <span class="highlight">democracy</span> unit, as it is called, which set out a priority list for pressuring those companies to implement this program over the next few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to consider for a moment to realise the impact on the minds of potential investors of the mere statement of the Premier yesterday in Melbourne: ‘We will introduce worker <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in private industry after 1 980 ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pretty clear that if it establishes an organisation for the economic development of South Australia but at the same time creates another organisation which is in contradistinction thereto, with exactly contrary objectives, such as the worker <span class="highlight">democracy</span> unit, there will be very little development in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that most of my colleagues on both sides of the chamber work very hard and that they are in fact desirous of trying to help effectively the operation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the attempt by the Labor Party to overthrow parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia, the attempt by the Whitlam Government to rule without Supply and to force the banks to provide the finance to enable the then Government to continue contrary to the democratic process had created a situation where the man with the responsibility for blowing the whistle and letting the people speak had to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me the situation in November 1975 was reminiscent of some of the great battles between the Parliament and the Executive in the whole history of the development of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the relatively few parts of the world where it exists today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They pillaged the system in so many ways but this was never better demonstrated than by the attempt to hang on to power at a time when the democratic system in a bicameral <span class="highlight">democracy</span> had reached the stage where the people were entitled to have their say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major point I make is that I believe that the whole of the Parliament has a tremendous responsibility at this time to ensure that its procedures are relevant to the day and age in which we live, that they are understood by the public and that they enhance the public attitude towards parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I refer briefly to the need for this Parliament at all times to engage in a degree of what may be called futurology or what is called by Alvin Tofler anticipatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have rightly stated that this cynicism and this suspicion of parliament and parliamentarians is a danger to the institution itself and to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who believes in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, I regret that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at  Sir Zelman  Cowen ‘s career as a lawyer, an academic, a vice chancellor and a commentator on public affairs, we find running right through that career a respect for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and for the principles of liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which I think is something which all members of parliament share with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe we can maintain a sensible and good democratic system if people hold the institutions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in a peculiar way this institution is able to meet the problems of present <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we change the way we operate, not by way of confrontation but co-operatively, we will increase our influence, the ability of government to respond to the people and we will have a much healthier functioning <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and less of the sort of headlines which top George Negus’s column. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In full public eye, he accepted the big payoff, more than $70,000 a year plus benefits and the hardships of the post in Paris, a large income by any standards, but surely a cheap reward for dividing his nation, undermining the very fibre of Australian constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and degrading the position of Head of State of the Australian Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We probably would not in terms of local <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but it would be a change to see a different face around the place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that Australians are so careless of their rights in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that they objected to having to vote again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot get away from the fact that the present leader of the Liberal Party and Opposition in New South Wales was, to say the least, belittling <span class="highlight">democracy</span> when he went shopping with people who ostensibly were going to give him some inside information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has to be recognised by those who claim to support parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that a very sizeable minority of Australians have lost faith in the Parliament as a place for genuine debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>SPEECH BY THE PREMIER, MR DUNSTAN, AT MT ELIZA STAFF COLLEGE, MELBOURNE, MONDAY, 20th FEBRUARY 1978-INDUSTRIAL <span class="highlight">DEMOCRACY</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government is committed to the principle that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> only truly exists when citizens, as nearly as is practicable, are given an effective say in the decisions affecting their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An essential aim of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to ensure that an employee can move out of the situation where he is merely the object of economic circumstances decided by someone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is a practical commonsense approach to improving the job satisfaction of employees and the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations in which they work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australia’s Tripartite Industrial <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Committeecomprised of leading employer, union and Government representatives- maintains that joint consultation, the delegation of responsibilities and employee involvement in the decision-making process will solve many problems because dissatisfied employees are given the opportunity to reduce the sources of dissatisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, then, industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is concerned with providing employees with the opportunity and the right to influence decisions within their work organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many forms industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programmes might take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> cannot be viewed in isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are often not responsive to initiating industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programmes during the present economic climate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in South Australia my Government’s Unit for Industrial <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> has been working closely with several private companies undertaking industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a form of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that has worked to enhance the efficiency of the organisation in terms of productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has also improved the employees lot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the current economic climate, there is no pressure being placed upon private sector organisations to undertake industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No major industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> initiatives that involve structural changes will be brought about by legislation in the private sector until the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia our main focus in the industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> area is in the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of our experiences with industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programmes in more than half of our departments, the Government is currently looking at the Public Service Act with a view to making some important changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply by pluralising the word ‘officer’ we could open up the opportunity for meaningful industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> situations and semi-autonomous work groups to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some, both management and employees have to date shown no real interest in or awareness of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In others, like the Fire Brigade and the State Government Insurance Commission, employees have shown considerable interest in being involved in industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government will amend this Act so that all legal impediments to the development of different forms of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, we are not legislating for industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Government recognises that its industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> policy must proceed and develop pragmatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not lay down a blue print for industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and insist that it will ‘do the job’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the South Australian Government is committed to removing legislative obstacles to industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programmes will help develop positive attitudes among directors, shareholders, management, employees and trade union officials about the aims and objectives of work organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise, however, that management and employees may be interested in industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> for different reasons, but the absence of a common motive should not be seen as an obstacle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sincere and genuine implementation of an industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> programme will improve job satisfaction and the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank you for inviting me here today and I look forward to meeting many of you at our International Industrial <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Conference, to be held in Adelaide in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An executive governing without the sanction of the Parliament is the hallmark, not of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, but of a dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had he not acted as he did, had he not prevented the unconstitutional designs of the last Government being consummated, the shape of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would have been twisted and distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, I suppose the opportunity to do this is basically what a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, I believe it is relevant to say that it is on the determination and capacity of people to collect information, sift it and analyse it, that the future of this free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as of any free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> around the world, is largely dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has spoken strongly on two occasions in just over two years and it has endorsed the Australian way, the free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of people living within a legal system of restraint which they have developed themselves and which they impose themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the first of the basic facets of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may be the diginity and security of the family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second basic facet to a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> revolves around equality of opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third facet of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- the Australian system- relates to the profit motive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that if our sort of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is to survive we must recognise that freedom itself is a somewhat meaningless word unless it is freedom within a measure of discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention those few basic yardsticks of a free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, not because they are the only ones, but because I think it is worth while and proper that we should consider the system which we have developed and which has developed us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is becoming fashionable to say that representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has failed us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It behoves the Government to recognise that it should support in a legislative framework and a political atmosphere those in institutions within societies who are the constitutionalists who believe in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the direct antithesis of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has to be achieved if Australia is to reach political maturity and a state of full <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the state of lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which this country finds itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that there will be an early general election for both Houses and the people can do what, in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as ours, is their responsibility and duty and theirs alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier in the Address-in-Reply debate Senatory Chaney pointed out that a major theme in much of the public life of the Governor-General,  Sir Zelman  Cowen, has been a great respect for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and its various institutions as well as for the principles of liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan that was used to overthrow <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Greece was the plan that was devised by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to protect Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an outrageous twist of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament should be a place where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists not only in theory but also in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and in the rights of people, although I certainly do not believe in proportional representation I tell you that now- while we have this situation we must accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Harradine  or any member of a minority party has proven objections and can show factually that the Standing Order is not operating in the true sense of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this chamber, I will be happy to take a different stand when the time comes to make this procedure a permanent part of the Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to remember that Parliament is the focal point of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as has  Senator Wright,  I strongly oppose this move, which I think is a negation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, a friendly country which Australia regarded as a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was in serious difficulties- had been invaded by another country- and we believed it was to our advantage strategically as well as morally to support it, I imagine that although we were not in a position to send our own forces there we would allow recruitment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One suspects that it was only because of the peculiar processes of United States <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that there began to be very serious concern in most democratic communities about these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, those sorts of activities have been revealed by the peculiar processes of United States <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we all sometimes criticise but which I believe on occasions we have reason to envy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>perfectly permissible for anyone in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to dissent from the policies of the Government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it might be useful to take as a point of departure the familiar proposition that the distinction between dissent and subversion lies in the dividing line between the use and the abuse of the instruments of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">democracy</span> means anything the Parliament should have the facilities to enable it to work properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I appreciate that it has been very difficult for you and for your colleague  Mr Speaker  to indulge in a mass Athenian-style <span class="highlight">democracy</span> consultation in cases like this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think such measures as are introduced should be scrutinised by a committee- and I think the Privileges Committee is probably the most appropriate committeewhich contains representatives of all parties in this Parliament so that we can somehow protect the democratic processes and practices of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the things that are happening from the point of view of the imposition of an authoritarian attitude by governments make me feel that our freedom and the preservation of our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may be at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great thing about a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that the majority tends to be right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have become very tired of his prejudices, his biases, his basic lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, his irrascible behaviour, his irresponsible utterings, his extraordinary behaviour pattern, his ban on street marches which has created concern in this Parliament and in Queensland generally and his very unreasonable attitude in respect to  Mr Milan  Brych. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> let the Senate take a stand and again say, not that it will halt a budget to force an election but that it will halt a particular piece of legislation on a most sensitive matter of the highest significance in Australia’s national history beginning at the definition of race relations in this country for the next 50 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I find most lacking in report is that it is assumed as a matter of desirability in the interests of the listening public that if there is an opportunity to broadcast parliamentary debates, it should be taken up by the Parliament itself; that listeners will in some way be gratified by that decision; that the process of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia will be better understood; and the cause of the Parliament will be advanced by increasing the hours of broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is perhaps the most serious of the attacks on the very foundations of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which we have yet experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If people protest, if they do not want the plant built near them or built at all, if they do not want to work on it, if they try to talk other people out of working on it, if they try to acquaint other people with the problems- if they use all the forms of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we believe in to express a point of view to fellow citizens- under this legislation they can be jailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a matter so important to the public, the general people, as this one I believe, daunted as 1 am by the primitive nature of our institutions as compared with the advanced nature of solution to scientific questions, that in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we have to maintain the true office of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That phrase spoken by a member of the Royal family, to whom  Sir Robert  was so proud to look as the pillar of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, was as appropriate as it was simple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No greater tribute could have been paid to a man who was himself a bastion of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than to have Prince Charles, representing the Queen, take a leading part in  Sir Robert’s  funeral service in his own church, in his own home city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To exclude from such discussions and to prevent contributions from representatives of sizeable minority groups represented in Parliament, is to deny the very process of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- something which this Government has supposedly pledged itself to uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that in those days the members of that Committee saw grave defects in the Constitution and made recommendations about those defects in relation to matters which I think are of increasingly fundamental concern to the economic efficiency of this country and, if we are to be a viable <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the 1980s, issues which are of the utmost importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter that I shall debate is one of the basic tenets of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, namely, the freedom of the individual to offer himself for public service in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we have delegates to a constitutional convention representing the executive governments of the houses of parliament of the various States of Australia, what we will have is discussion which takes place on the basis of what is most convenient for an executive government rather than what is in the best interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and federalism in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thank God for the opportunity for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to prevail in a way which relates peculiarly to a federal compact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should the people of Australia not have some say directly about those people who are to discuss the future amendments to their Constitution, as opposed to the executives which are so far removed by processes of election from the people that, whilst we can say that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> prevails, we cannot say that for this purpose <span class="highlight">democracy</span> prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not be proper for me to comment in detail on what is occurring there, but our information is that recent developments have taken place following the Peruvian Government’s preparations for elections in June this year for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution to prepare the country for a return to parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and I believe in achieving reforms and advancement by way of debate, discussion and common sense rather than by the law of the jungle, which has been promoted as a result of the events that took place in this Parliament in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It deprives his electorate of a fundamental facility in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, that is, easy access to parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a simple process of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that a Minister ought to be able to explain why he or she objects to a particular amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have a responsibility within themselves to amend their rules and ordinances so that the students on the campuses should have full <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have talked to the vicechancellors and the principals of the colleges and have stressed that they have a direct responsibility to look at their rules and ordinances and to amend them if necessary to bring about full <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one of the essential arteries of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and the neglect of it leads to all the confusion, mistakes and substitution of administrative decisions for law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> self-government is both a right and a responsibility that cannot be shirked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to the Opposition that it is a travesty of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where the Administrator has power to veto or to override the elected government, that is, the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but I think this again is throwing <span class="highlight">democracy</span> out of the window for the sake of trying to safeguard some of the Country Party seats in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these high standards were not upheld, the people ‘s confidence in Government- a confidence which is fundamental to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- would be undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that our role in this chamber involves us not only in inter-party disputes and questions of policy that arise from time to time, but also in ensuring that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> does work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am on my feet I merely put on the record the view that to hear someone like  Senator Rae  suggest that the acquisition of five members of staff for Estimates committees in this country will somehow save <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, will somehow overcome the very real difficulties of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which have been created by the past behaviour of certain members of this House, is a joke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee for the Restoration of <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> in Greece might have agitated against its Government, but it never attempted to set up a bogus embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obligation to submit formal audited reports later, but as soon as possible, would remain.The Committee believes that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> requires that Ministers, as the representatives of the Executive branch of Government, keep both the Parliament and the people informed of the activities of departments and statutory authorities, rather then permit bureaucratic differences to provide an excuse for keeping those activities hidden from scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It no longer serves the need of a modern <span class="highlight">democracy</span> based on the Westminster system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view there was no hope of this Government introducing legislation for freedom of information which would have any significant teeth and which would go anywhere near as far as did the legislation in that unusual and, in a way, great <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, the United States, where legislation of this kind was first brought into existence after the Scandinavian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depends very much on regular consultation with the electorate- much more regular than general elections every three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond that, we believe that the strength, productivity and morale of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> depend perhaps more than is realised on the rights of citizens themselves to initiate legislation, even if this right is perhaps not exercised very often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conventional wisdom, of course, is that Athenian style <span class="highlight">democracy</span> cannot work except in a very small state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of some interest to note that when so many of the States of the United States of America introduced citizen initiative about the turn of the century it was regarded then as a radical solution to the problem of a decline in faith in representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be remedied not by trivial band-aiding but only by a conscious and determined move towards a better form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a world in which <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is so much on the retreat- I am sure that all honourable senators know that and would agree with me on that point- surely there is every reason for Australia to step boldly forward on a road towards more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rather than less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is yet another reason why we should consider joining that enlightened group of nations, mostly small nations and middle powers like ourselves, such as Switzerland, Holland and the Scandinavian nations, who have an active interest in better forms of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I make this final point: Either one believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or one does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As democratic socialists- we bear the label proudly- we stand for the values of equality, liberty and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>: greater real equality in the distribution of wealth, income, power and status in the community; full respect for the personal freedom and dignity of the individual; the fullest possible opportunity for democratic participation by every individual in all the major decisions that affect his or her life in the work place and in the local community as much as in the larger political sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If a conservation group contacts me and I wish to get something from the Minister tonight I will do so rather than wait for a fortnight, because the process of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has to be speeded up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for example, to the second resolution which resolved that the committee- that is the Tasmanian Committee- write to the Government seeking its assurance that in the interests of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of the suffering people concerned, it effectively raise at the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation on the human rights committee the systematic suppression of human rights by the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the foreign domination and alien subjugation by the Soviet Union of the Baltic States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 18th and 19th centuries an upper House was seen as a check on change and on the advance of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and upper Houses usually had appropriate membership restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Madison, the principal author of the United States Constitution, campaigned for a strong Senate ‘as a check on the <span class="highlight">democracy</span>: It cannot therefore be made too strong’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Democracy</span>’, said Emerson, ‘becomes a government of bullies tempered by editors’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second, a day later, was the disclosure that plans for implementation of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Australia were to be quietly shelved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>South Australia’s Industrial <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Unit will draw up worker participation plans based on experience with “workers councils” ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer now to an article in the Melbourne  Age  of 17 May 1978 headed: ‘Dunstan <span class="highlight">democracy</span> scares workers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Dunstan continues to frighten industry with talk of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and worker control then I won ‘t be able to find a job if I’m next off ‘ at this place ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For so long  Mr Dunstan  has done so many things and now, because we are nearing another election perhaps in 1980 or 1981, he is starting to back away a little from industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and so many other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the people know that if the Dunstan Government is elected for another three years we will see industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it he showed himself to be one of the great enemies of true <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country by carrying out the most outrageous gerrymander that any Premier or leader of a State has done in the history of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This then leads us back to the dispute between the definition of ‘conservatism’, ‘liberalism’ and socialism’, and to consider how far in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we can direct people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is indeed my conviction that most Australians believe in the system of free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which is based on the family unit, which admits the profit motive within the law as being satisfactory to the desires and the dictates of human nature, which admits equality of opportunity, which admits that freedom is a relatively meaningless concept unless it is experienced within a properly conceived and majority held and enforced discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the free enterprise <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which I believe is one of the things basic to out society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, with the loose statements emanating from the Premier about the introduction of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, without giving any reasons for or background to the proposal but suggesting that all companies in South Australia will have to have one-third of their board of directors appointed by the Government, one-third appointed by the trade union, and the shareholders, if they are lucky, will get one-third representation on their own boards, is it any wonder that the owners of business are thinking about moving to other States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Mr Colin  Branson, the General Manager of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry S.A.

    <p>The deputations on industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in South Australia have all been met by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a travesty of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the proposals put up by the Minister for the Capital Territory,  Mr Ellicott,  do not reduce the nature of that travesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is done, the strength of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is ensured and confidence and pride will return to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> exists where the majority for the time being makes the laws but tolerates the advocacy of different points of view and the living of different life styles which do not involve violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I were to respond, and had the power so to do, to the last part of the honourable senator’s question, I fear that some of the mystique of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would disappear from around us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been pointed out by others on more than one occasion, we in the Senate provide one of the more important checks and balances within our constitutional <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is small wonder that a degree of cynicism is developing within the Australian community about the role of government and the role of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that this is a serious matter for further consideration and for further development in the interests of the smooth, effective and efficient workings of a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a Minister to relinquish that responsibility and to give the power to someone else, to give sole power to someone else so that that Minister cannot then control the situation, is a breach of and a departure from parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there are many critics on both sides of the fence of the industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> propositions in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the developments to which I have referred have been the subject of comment for some time in the print media available in this country, the British and American weeklies in particular, I suppose that the first acquaintance that most Australians would have had with these developments would have been the  Four Corners  television program ‘<span class="highlight">Democracy</span> at Risk’ which was shown by the Australian Broadcasting Commission on the weekend of 7 and 8 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim that this disruptive action has been provoked by the savage cutbacks which have been imposed by this Government- cutbacks in funding and staffing which have a clear political intent, that of limiting the independence of the ABC, of hamstringing its ability to provide the independent comment and news that are essential to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A free library, open for all, is part of the essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To develop and strengthen, <span class="highlight">democracy</span> demands the widest possible contact with new ideas, new information and new horizons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No wonder there is cynicism in the Australian community about parliamentary promises and parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the fundamental underpinning of the concept of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not only that the representatives elected by individuals and citizens should make decisions of this nature and not people who are not elected by the citizens, but also that when the lives of individuals are affected they ought to have recourse against or in support of the people who made those decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">democracy</span> places on its citizens not only the right but also the obligation to decide important and divisive issues themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a country does not do that, it should not call itself a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the basic principle of the kind of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> all of us in this Parliament are supposed to cherish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is a proper operation in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I respect their obligation to represent that viewpoint to each and every one of us, but it comes from people who largely accept the principle of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> rather than participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which is the cause with which I would prefer to be associated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that I support the general principles of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> I think I am entitled to say that the Senate is entitled to consider the views expressed by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here is a clear and reasonable indication of the opinion of people in the Australian Capital Territory- the people who are, after all, directly affected and whose views in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> should not only be respected but should be paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an abhorrent position to those of us who truly accept the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is how much opposed members of the present Government were to giving any form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They did not want to give people in the Northern Territory any form of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently evidence has developed in relation to the New South Wales experience which confirms that it is in the best interests of the voters and of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that an optional system of voting should exist, particularly in relation to the Australian Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> requires that Ministers, as the representatives of the Executive branch of Government, keep both the Parliament and the people informed of the activities of Departments and Statutory Authorities, rather than permit bureaucratic differences to provide an excuse for keeping those activities hidden from scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Parliament House will greatly enhance the national capital, and it will also be a focal point for the ever-increasing number of Australians and visitors from overseas who wish to see at first hand the centre of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can foresee what effect that will have on the political parties of Australia or on parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy is to have no one people dominating any other people, no black nation dominating any other black nation in Africa and I think they are going to teach us, if we would only listen and learn, a lesson in ethnic <span class="highlight">democracy</span> where each people run their own affairs and are not intimidated or dominated by any other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to be granted the privilege by the Government to engage in peaceful protest is not to enjoy a civil right and, surely, that is really what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a democracyadmittedly, for the time being- the majority makes the laws but the minority is entitled to dissent from the Government’s program by peaceful, non-violent means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ethical implications of this kind of intent are in themselves serious since surely under our system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is basic that when a government loses the confidence of the people through an election it also loses the right to influence the affairs of the nation in a decisive way as from that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the War of Independence for the United States of America some fundamental principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> were enunciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus one of the basic tenets of Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, namely the freedom of the individual to offer himself for public service in the Parliament, is severely limited for public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, this seems to be a fundamental reason for advancing ideas which would provide more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country rather than less <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and it would increase- although this is a source of irritation- the numbers of checks and balances on the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say to those people that one either believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or one does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one does not believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, why not go across to an executive-type government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a situation where one can have a little bit of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or more <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do so not as a matter in which we seek any political advantage or in which we are pushing our own ideology but as a matter on which we feel genuinely that as representatives in the Senate of the people of Australia we have a right and duty at least to say: ‘You, the people of Australia have a right to know about extensions of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which might benefit you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When 1 refer to industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> I do not mean the sort of industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> described by  Mr Dunstan  in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is not industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is time we looked at the options open to us in relation to public funding because almost every comparable parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> has some form of public aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labour Party said that as the parties were indispensable to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> they should be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If political parties in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> fail to meet these new challenges that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> will fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This motion is designed to test the opinion of the Senate on the problems of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which I outlined in this chamber some months ago, and the possible role of the Senate in overcoming those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are becoming is not a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> but, to use Lord Hailsham ‘s expression, an elective dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government by the Public Service is actually moderately good government but has little to do with <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and nothing to do with the parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> one should aim to delegate Executive power to the body closest to the people on whom that power can be effectively exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that I maintain that the proposal warrants proper consideration as one part of the practical proposals that might be considered by the community in the general aim of strengthening parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard a lot from  Senator Rae,  at the time he mentioned, about the Westminster tradition, about the responsibility of the Executive to report to the Parliament- both Houses of the Parliament, I might add, as  Senator Rae  frequently reminds us- about the necessity, in order that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may survive, for us to get such reports, and about the Executive being responsible to both chambers of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is quite irrelevant because <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is not a means to an end, it is an end in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we have a moral responsiblity to align ourselves with all of those democratic countries whenever we can, to make it clear that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is important to us not only domestically but also internationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view, we ought to be putting forward the proposition that the ideology to which we subscribe is an ideology of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, of human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wheeldon  spoke first about human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement put down by the Government is a statement on human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and how Australia sees the world situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I readily acknowledge that citizen initiative does enjoy some current popularity in certain overseas countries, particularly the United States, it is true that the idea of citizen initiative and a referendum dates from the time, and was most fashionable at the time, when nations were essentially run by elites elected by rich and powerful minorities, when full adult franchise was unknown, when representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> was not fully developed, and when there was genuine frustration at the absence of an opportunity for the popular voice to make itself heard in the business of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me turn to another aspect of this problem: The cost of citizen initiative in the sense of the resources that need to be expended if an initiative and referendum system is to be introduced, and the implications of that cost for the quality of the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> it is supposed to embody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recall in particular his remarks, when seeking unsuccessfully to introduce this matter last week, that one was either for or against <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are those of us who oppose this system against <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in the way in which  Senator Mason  suggests that we must be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far be it for me to concede, after the events of 1975, that our present system of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is perfect, but the point that has to be made is that our system of government is one of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which the people make a choice between the people and the parties that they want to represent them on the basis of the programs produced by those seeking election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, I suggest, would be the ultimate tragedy for Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> if his proposal were to come to fruition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>89 on the Notice Paper- by  Senator Mason  relating to the whole subject of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by referendum as against representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, which is a question that has arisen in the United States in particular in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The determination of the people in those countries is to win for themselves the very things that we take for granted; that is, selfdetermination, <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, a decent sharing of wealth and living in peace within their nation and with other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator and I can sit back and say: ‘Well, it is not quite the same form of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years Spain has passed from being an oppressive feudal state to being a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, however fragile that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly external pressure and moral exhortation was needed from countries outside the area to make sure that that election was completed, but it was completed and we have a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>George Fernandez, who is the leader of a sister party to the party that sits on this side of the House, has been released from gaol in India as part of the return to <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should try to be perceived in the world as being in favour of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, human rights and human freedom, and where we see those things abused we should oppose it and express our opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff  said that the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  was all about human rights and <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this means is that some people who take advantage of our democratic and parliamentary system and who live in a representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> with all the advantages which it confers on them, are not prepared to pay for the services which they expect this Parliament to provide in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that comes to mind is his adherence to the basic principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and to the right of the Senate to act in a proper and conscientious manner in respect of its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is supposed to be all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone who lives in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would support the argument that it is the most desirable form of government because it should maximise the freedom of the individual in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most people are prepared to accept some delay and some inefficiency in the workings of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as the price they pay for safeguarding those freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is fundamental to the long-term survival of a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The maxim laid down by Cicero, ‘Salus populi suprema lex’ is perhaps the guiding attitude behind the development of security services in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of this analysis it might be useful to take as a point of departure the familiar proposition that the distinction between dissent and subversion lies in the dividing line between the use and the abuse of the instruments of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the FBI’s crimes may have threatened our <span class="highlight">democracy</span> even more than the Watergate crimes didbecause the FBI’s lawlessness has been going on for such a long time on such a broad and pervasive scale, and because it has had such a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly- it seemed that the government wasn’t going to do anything about these abuses of the law after their disclosure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is that it is a publicly observable process, that decisions are made as a result of information made available to the public, debated by the public and dealt with ultimately by the elected representatives of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If these high standards were not upheld, the people’s confidence in government- a confidence which is fundamental to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- would be undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree that the two Houses have separate functions, but in this parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> they also have similar functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns  Mr Porter,  that famous upholder of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, along with his friends, Bjelke-Petersen, better known as Holy Joe and  Mr Hinze,  better known as Ramu. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest also that it is totally repugnant to the meaning of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have powerful agencies investigating and reporting upon private citizens without those agencies being accountable to an elected body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real crux of the issue is how in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> we can maintain objectivity without a security agency becoming the plaything of a political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which the people working on that project went about establishing their case, explaining their case, appeared before the independent inquiry, presented their case and persuaded the inquiry of the validity of their case is an exercise in real participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span> on the one hand, in that people who are interested and informed can bring recommendations to the Government; and a real outpouring of concern for natural resources, the environment and conservation on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not be protected if ASIO, under its charter, past, present or future, uses the same sort of personnel and adopts the same sort of attitudes as it has for the last 30 years- people of prejudice, people of the belief that everybody who engages in legitimate political activity in some way can be involved in unlawful acts and subversive action, and is thus a threat to the <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He says that, as well, there must be a redistribution of economic power; industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> must be encouraged where workers challenge the prerogatives of bosses on the how, when and where of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I say that is the well established and accepted argument, certainly in the United States, that the implications of the use of these powers go primarily to the chilling effect that their use has on the political activity which is essential to the workings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If these high standards were not upheld, the people’s confidence in government- a confidence which is fundamental to Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- would be undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, the Opposition’s amendment, because I believe that potentially it creates more problems than it is likely to solve, is not one that would have my support, however, the power that the clause currently vests in the DirectorGeneral is a power which, within the system of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that we know in many ways is an unwise one to so vest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, if the only test of a man’s habits is that he holds views different from those of the regime itself, clearly one would share  Senator Puplick  ‘s expression of distaste that what is being done is setting a kind of precedent in the world for very grave instability and of course a total lack of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume that by and large in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> the real sanctions that exist against the misbehaviour of Prime Ministers, Ministers, Leaders of the Opposition or members are basically not particularly legal sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our view, they are not appropriate for a country like Australia which has pretensions to a degree of sophistication and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in government to impose on the people of Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no evidence whatsoever, either on the face of the legislation or in the way in which it is likely to operate in practice, that the Executive Council will be any kind of bulwark of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it is potentially more destructive of civil rights, justice and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> than many other laws and activities that the Attorney-General is so ready to attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as a senator for New South Wales I assert again that the attitude of the Premier and the attitude of the Attorney-General as his parliamentary hatchet man has been to pack rape parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I made a sufficient impression because someone on the Opposition side was so interested in parliamentary control and <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that he took up the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the close ties between the two countries, the importance of this assistance to the Papua New Guinea national Budget and the need to assist in the development of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, and for strategic reasons, will the Minister assure this House that there will be no reduction in the overall quantum of assistance to Australia’s nearest neighbour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is correctly stated as the continuing dilemma of any <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such powers, which have not been included in any constitution resulting from a legal transference of power by Britain, deny Government powers which are fundamental to a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- or indeed to any responsible Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that if one of the purposes of what we describe as the Western system of government is to sponsor <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, then at least one of those factors which should be considered when one is examining the future of some country is how democratic that country is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, in dealing with an issue which is supposed to be related to the fundamental rights of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, we find that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  visits the military dictator of Nigeria, apparently in order to obtain his approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Senator Evans has asked what difference it makes, but I would have thought that one of the principles we were supposed to be upholding was the principle of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite clear that it was not, that the last thing that was discussed was <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is most serious, apart from the serious questions of principle involved in calling on Muzorewa to renege on solemn agreements he entered into and the disregard for <span class="highlight">democracy</span> within Zimbabwe, is the future that this is likely to bring to the rest of southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have hoped that what we were trying to do was to remove racism and to preserve and to expand <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it accentuates racism by giving support to those who believe that there can be no peaceful agreement and it damages <span class="highlight">democracy</span> by saying, as  Senator Evans  has said: ‘What difference does it make if Zimbabwe is more democratic than Nigeria?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those people who feel as I do, that this is an important matter- it may well be that I am the only one who feels this way- should continue to be vigilant on this subject and to see that we are prepared to speak out in favour of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as strongly as those who are dedicated to the destruction of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are prepared to act towards that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the complaints from the main organiser, a  Mr Rundle  who is no doubt a strong member of the Liberal Party, was that a large issue was the proposed amendment to the State’s industrial laws which  Mr Rundle  said would allow industrial <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in through the back door and would reduce the right of management to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It drives further apart the two basic political entities in this country, and the wider that gap becomes the less chance there is for the survival of that free <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which is the Australian system, the system of which I believe we are all so proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are not in favour of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They wanted to show their objection in the strongest way by saying that they would not consult with the Government until it removed that threat to <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of great regret that despite the measured opposition by those who have been involved in the industrial movement in a full time capacity, those who have been involved in understanding industrial legislation and despite the attempts of the Opposition to suggest to the Government the unworkability of this piece of legislation, it goes without saying that the whole process of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and those opposing voices will be unheeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no wonder that parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is under challenge in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First, we live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and cannot force people to work if they refuse to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  always  thought very proudly that Australia was a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that it was one of the few countries in the world where <span class="highlight">democracy</span> counts for anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in any sector of the community, the people do not respond to the community’s needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having experienced three, four or five years in a liberal <span class="highlight">democracy</span> such as Australia these people return home with an understanding which can only benefit our commercial and political relations with those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleagues on the Committee-  Senator Missen  and  Senator Evans-  have dealt with the central importance for the working of modern <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of effective public access to government information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But not only that; I believe that in the United States it has proved to be a great factor in helping to provide a new awareness of the value of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we believe, as the Committee has clearly stated, that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as a system of government is operational only when there is available a maximum degree of public information about what the elected representatives of the people, and their permanent servants, are up to- if that belief is held not only by the Committee but also by the members of the Parliament who constitute the Executive- I believe the report and its recommendations should see their way speedily into legislative form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use just looking at what they say; but if they say that with their system there will be greater freedoms, more <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and greater justice than under the systems existing elsewhere in the world, surely all of us have a necessity to examine how they do conduct their own societies so see whether their words and the claims they make about superiority of their system and the desirability of that system being adopted by other countries is borne out by what one sees practiced within their own society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is all right in Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand but that it does not work elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One often wonders how far <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is going to the extreme right of the political spectrum, and undoubtedly under this Government assaults are being made on <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human rights, and respect for human rights, are in fact a precondition of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and a precondition of the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is the respect for individual human beings and individual human rights that makes <span class="highlight">democracy</span> possible and the rule of law an achievable aim of civilised societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be recalled that <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, civil liberties and human rights are a fragile flower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his Menzies Oration delivered on 12 May 1978 in Sydney, he warned about the problems of centralised <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which required us to write down limitations upon the power of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Convention did, however, discuss almost to the end the most celebrated of American ‘rights’, and there were more reasons for discarding or diluting them than an unshakeable faith in parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to have such a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> obviously does not exist simply where the majority for the time being makes the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it would regard, as I think  Senator Puplick  put most eloquently, rights as being an inherent attribute of being fortunate to the resident within the Australian <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and that State boundaries and State jurisdictions and the accident of birth and the accident of residence should play no part in the question of whether an Australian resident is entitled to vindication in an impartial court of his rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, in debating the issues of racial discrimination and human rights, is really beginning to concern itself about <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and about the interpretation of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> as it is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, of course, claim to be a <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word itself needs quite a degree of analysis to see whether in fact our understanding of it is acceptable, because clearly <span class="highlight">democracy</span> means different things to different people, to different groups and certainly different parties and to different governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, if we were to follow through that thinking we could probably come to some interesting conclusions, particularly in relation to what  Senator Bonner  has just said about how those who are discriminated against would see what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is really about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the deficiencies in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as we practice it, that government, responding to some degree of public pressure and demand, has the need to introduce legislation that would extend the principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and make it a much more meaningful form by which society shall function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of the Premier of Queensland,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  would differ from the concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of  Senator Bonner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the concept of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of  Senator Missen  would differ fundamentally from the concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> of even members of his own party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find that I have a broader concept of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is about than some members of my own party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we apply the yardstick of what <span class="highlight">democracy</span> is really about, we need to analyse society itself to see whether in a democratic society power is shared and whether there is a means by which citizens can feel that they participate in the affairs of society and of government, whether it be in the form of representative <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or participatory <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to analyse the role that a Lang Hancock has in <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, as defined in this country, and compare it with the roles of a black or migrant woman or the roles of other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that John Singleton is a person whose concepts of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> would differ from mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the dinner break I was speaking about the need to see these pieces of legislation in the context of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> within our country and the fact that we had to introduce such legislation being an indication of some of the deficiencies within our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> requires respect for human rights, as it requires acceptance of the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we analyse <span class="highlight">democracy</span> a little further we see that it also demands a society of equality, of a degree of equity for all of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we have to legislate to that end is something of an indictment of those who merely speak of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in parrot fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that is why people such as  Mr Killen  and  Senator Puplick  in recent times have pointed out how fragile is our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, how the scars remain after certain events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot say that we live in a <span class="highlight">democracy</span> or equal society when, for example, even in the reporting of the debates of the Parliament, one person sitting up in the Press Gallery can be said to have a lot more power than one who sits at the table itself, inasmuch as what the former decides to report plays a part in disseminating what is said in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there would be no question that we have a very long way to go in really applying the fundamental principles of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and of overcoming all the inequalities that exist within our society, of providing a basis by which minority views are heard, listened to, and often understood and acted upon, a basis on which we set ourselves the objective of building a much more tolerant sort of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The theories of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> and the way <span class="highlight">democracy</span> operates ought to be examined in the light of the thousands and thousands of cases of discrimination that appear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when we are talking about our traditions in this field I think we ought to be according recognition to both the development of the common law and the development of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the principles of universal suffrage, the Bill of Rights enacted in 1688 and freedom of religion are some of the great achievements of parliament and parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us acknowledge the fact that we have very strong traditions and that we have developed strong institutions in our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>, in our courts, in our rule of law and in what we still call in many ways the common law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted a growing volume of reports of a new repression of political dissent in the People’s Republic of China such that, for example, the free expression of criticism of party leadership via the so-called <span class="highlight">Democracy</span> Wall is fraught with danger? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when such ‘high-falutin’ ‘ notions were considered the backbone of parliamentary <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the understanding that the Opposition has of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly <span class="highlight">democracy</span> Court style and it is <span class="highlight">democracy</span> which ought not be accepted in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many ways the Northern Territory is subject to the administration of the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government, It is a blot on the face of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> that neither the Minister nor the Government is prepared to stand up to the people who are trying to bushrange their way through legislation in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is the means to approach the matter if one believes in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> at the university campus level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> depends upon the vigorous participation and intervention of its members in the doings of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democracy</span> expects that in a voluntary fashion that drive occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happens that the United Nations charter states, and those who believe in <span class="highlight">democracy</span> are of the view, that no people should be compelled against their will to join an organisation and certainly no people should be compelled against their will to contribute financially to an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government move urgently, in the interests of a genuine <span class="highlight">democracy</span> in this country, for a system of public funding of all political parties similar to that applying in most Western democracies, to be introduced before the 1980 election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we witnessed today, that power is becoming greater as a result of a further monopolisation of the very essence of <span class="highlight">democracy</span>- the dissemination of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go so far as to say that the Parliament of this country has been reduced in stature not only by the events of 1 1 November 1975 but also by the activities of the present Government in maintaining its power by deluding and misinforming the people in our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, no Parliament can work unless there be an acknowledgement of past practice, together with an observation of the Standing Orders, which have been set out for no other purpose than to ensure the freedom of honourable senators to express themselves in parliamentary language and to enable <span class="highlight">democracy</span> to operate in our parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very rudiments of <span class="highlight">democracy</span> were not even observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>(I believe conditions at the Hope Vale jail are an insult to human dignity) I pointed out to them, ‘Where is our <span class="highlight">democracy</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></li>
