    <p>Having in mind the recent debate over  Mr Wilfred  Burchett, the Attorney-General  (Mr Hughes)  should take particular note of the South African Citizenship Act 1949, which empowers the Minister of the Interior to deprive a South African citizen of his <span class="highlight">nationality</span> if convicted of high treason, sedition or public violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, as the House will appreciate, the governments of a number of countries from which we draw our migrants, particularly those in the European area, take the view that under their <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws a former citizen of one of those countries does not lose his citizenship of that country if he acquires Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he happens to be resident in either the country of his birth or the country of his adoption the principle of master <span class="highlight">nationality</span> applies and the citizen ship of the country in which he lives at the time predominates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concentrations of persons of the same <span class="highlight">nationality</span> initially offer to the migrant and his family an opportunity to be with compatriots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also offer a migrant a sense of fellowship with members of his own <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a person loses the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of his country of origin upon acquiring Australian citizenship depends upon the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position under Yugoslav and Greek law is that Yugoslav and Greek nationals retain their <span class="highlight">nationality</span> upon becoming Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such cases the principle of master <span class="highlight">nationality</span> applies, which means that when such a person is in the country of either <span class="highlight">nationality</span> the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of that country predominates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an Australian citizen who is a dual national returns to the country of his other <span class="highlight">nationality</span> his Australian citizenship may not exempt him from any obligations, such as military service, which he may have as a national of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether we do this intentionally because we prefer assimilation to integration, or whether the determining factor is blind economic necessity, I have not yet determined, but the essential need of any integration programme is to keep together people who have an affinity of race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, in order that they might strengthen each other during the period of integration, during that period of their lives in which they suffer greatly the inevitable tensions produced by cultural conflict and the material poverty which Professor Henderson tells us so many southern European migrants suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Acting Minister for Immigration whether he has interpreted a recent statement of public interest referring to immigration which says: ‘the avoidance of any discrimination on any grounds of race or colour or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The avoidance of discrimination on any grounds of race or colour of skin or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others support a policy which might be described in this way: Avoid discrimination on any grounds of race, colour, skin or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The avoidance df discrimination on any grounds of race, colour of skin or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While stating that its immigration policy shall be administered with the avoidance of discrimination on any ground of race, or colour or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, the same Labor Party Conference adopted a policy to advise Australian mothers to limit their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is better to retain control of immigration as this Government has done, to be able to draw back the numbers of migrants rather than to be confronted with a flood of people over which there can be no control concerning race, colour of skin or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the policy of the Australian Labor Party were implemented little could be done to stop the flow of these people, so with 50,000 Indians coming into Australia - or 50,000 migrants of any <span class="highlight">nationality</span> - they, their spouses and children would represent 100,000 to 150,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that Australia will not allow a citizen enjoying Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> to also hold the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of another nation; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that many migrants in Australia are deterred from becoming naturalised because dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is not permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether a person loses his original <span class="highlight">nationality</span> upon becoming an Australian citizen depends entirely upon the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> law of the country of his original <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the clear answer to that example is, as he put in his own words, that pensions from West Germany are paid only to Germans who retain their <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, we realised that the benefits would be of special concern to those who, although they had lived and worked in Australia, retained sufficient ties with their homeland to make them desire to retain their original <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, since 1966 there has been no <span class="highlight">nationality</span> requirement for an Australian pension, while the residence qualification for age pension was halved, in 1962, from 20 years to 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps, however, I have to make it clear once again that the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> has been about for very many years between Australia and many other countries from which Australia has drawn migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only under my Government that any attempt has been made to tackle the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and to advise persons who have migrated to Australia and have been naturalised here of the steps which they can take to secure the recognition of their new <span class="highlight">nationality</span> from the countries of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday the honourable gentleman adverted to dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> which is, of course, a matter of great complexity and gives rise to some impressive problems’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, their previous <span class="highlight">nationality</span> had not been extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is a classic case of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The master <span class="highlight">nationality</span> would be the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> they first had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the first case that I have encountered involving dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> where the master national state has not sought to inform the other state that it is holding within its power people who hold themselves out as being citizens of that state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the matter of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> the present Government has never regarded it as insuperable that there should be 2 nations, each claiming that a certain person was its citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous Government never protested at Yugoslavia’s assertion of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in respect of Australian naturalised citizens of Yugoslavian birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>because of the limitations imposed by the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, and since, in  Mr Grskovic’s  case, there is no evidence that he has been denied the normal protection of Yugoslav law, I feel that the Australian Government would be on weak ground in registering a formal protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is not deterred by the technicalities of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been very concerned within my portfolio to see to it that the embarrassments of the past are no longer experienced by Australian citizens proceeding to countries of their birth which recognise dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is subsequently legitimated by its Dutch father, the child would acquire Netherlands <span class="highlight">nationality</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection it may be possible to reach accord on a principle similar to that in the ‘Protocol Relating to Military Obligations in Certain Cases of Dual <span class="highlight">Nationality</span>’ of the Hague Convention of 1930. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A State may not afford diplomatic protection to one of its nationals against a State whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> such person also possesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the same reasons the Opposition would like to see a continuation of the preferential treatment afforded to British subjects in relation to the proposal that an oath or affirmation of allegiance be taken by all except children under the age of 16 years, regardless of their former <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the right to assume that because of their British <span class="highlight">nationality</span> British subjects already are loyal subjects in the terms of the existing legislation and, therefore, swearing a separate oath on arrival in Australia is superfluous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fourth concerns dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Australian perspective it is not possible to retain Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> after having voluntarily acquired, except by way of marriage, citizenship or <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian citizen of full age and of full capacity, who, whilst outside Australia and New Guinea, by some voluntary and formal act, other than marriage, acquires the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or citizenship of  a  country other than Australia, shall thereupon cease to be an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of having embraced another <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in no way abrogates Yugoslav citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determination of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is primarily a matter for each individual nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, however, certain multilateral treaties in existence which regulate aspects of the law relating to <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is a 1930 League of Nations treaty dealing with aspects of military obligations in the case of persons with double <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another 1930 League treaty which addresses certain questions relating to the conflict of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws, but that treaty begins with the words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since this treaty there has been no multilateral treaty which has significantly rationalised the international position on <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government is able to conduct negotiations with all those nations whose laws on <span class="highlight">nationality</span> work to the disadvantage of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 1 of the convention dealing with the complex problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What both countries require is for the citizen seeking a new <span class="highlight">nationality</span> to renounce his previous citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is made all the more meaningless by the fact that dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> exists in some countries and that the country of origin sees fit not to recognise a renunciation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that they are assisted by having divided loyalties, a situation which exists under dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something which can be changed only by the laws of the countries which at present recognise dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill specifically provided that an Australian, when asked to state his <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, had only to say: ‘I am an Australian citizen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when we are endeavouring - I understand from the statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in this chamber that this is so - to establish with more certainty what dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> means, we believe that it would be foolish to eliminate a requirement that a new citizen in swearing his oath of allegiance should not first renounce his old allegience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we in no way restrict or contain what must be to all Australians the very worthwhile characteristics of Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the pure formality of renouncing an allegiance in order to elevate the whole quality of Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt in our negotiations with other countries to remove the concept, and sometimes the burden, of dual citizenship from those who take Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> we will be putting this point and I hope that in the negotiations the Minister, who should have learned a lesson from the tragic events in Yugoslavia, will put this point strongly and it will help him in those negotiations if he can say that Australian citizens have personally renounced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because some people regard their dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> as an advantage, and some regard it as a burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a question of maintaining Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be in the interests of Australia’s survival not to forgo our own concept of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> but to maintain the links which will give us defence protection, evidence of which in the eyes of the world may protect us from attack, because these outward signs may give to countries which might have aggressive intentions against us the lively apprehension that we would have powerful friends, powerful kinsmen, to come to our aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But prior to the suspension of the sitting he did say that the Yugoslav authorities did not require their citizens to renounce their allegiance when they acquire a new <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood the Minister to say that the Yugoslav people did not require a citizen from any other country who was seeking their <span class="highlight">nationality</span> to renounce bis former citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point raised by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party dealt with the renunciation of a person’s former <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If certain people are denied the opportunity of joining the work force because of some reason associated with religion, politics, race, sex, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or any other factor like that, productivity must suffer because fewer people than the number otherwise employed are working in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This convention is a declaration of intent, a declaration of a government’s policy, in this case in respect to discrimination on grounds of politics, religion, race, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or sex in employment or in employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pleasing thing I am able to say is that the Government is going to set the first example by cutting through all forms of discrimination that are based upon a person’s politics, religion, sex, race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I announce the membership of the various committees the House will recognise that the Government is practising what it preaches because the people who have been chosen to sit on the various committees will be people of outstanding competence and ability whose politics, religion, race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span> will be outside the popular ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be appointed because this Convention gives effect to a policy of no discrimination on the grounds of politics, race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Yugoslav authorities consequently contend that, in accordance with the principle of ‘master <span class="highlight">nationality</span>’, there was no obligation for them to advise the Australian Government <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, all of these cases involve the problem of ‘dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>’ and the Yugoslav authorities have contended that the Australian representatives cannot claim a right to the information or access to the persons concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the purpose of this Convention, the term woman’ means any female person, irrespective of age, <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, race or creed, whether married or unmarried, and the term ‘child’ means any child whether born of marriage or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other people, irrespective of their race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, may be sponsored by residents of Australia where they have qualifications, skills or experience recognised by the appropriate authorities in this country as well as a firm offer of employment commensurate with their skills for which there is a national need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the estimated number of persons over 16 years of age of each <span class="highlight">nationality</span> who were residentially qualified to apply for Australian citizenship on 31 December 1972 who had not done so (Hansard, 25 November 1971, page 3757). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following table shows the number of aliens of each <span class="highlight">nationality</span> who were granted Australian citizenship between 1 January 1945 and 3.1 December 1972 (includes children under the age of 16 years included on the Certificates of their parents). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and the USSR) do not recognise loss of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> by mere renunciation; specific permission to relinquish the original <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is required, and the renunciation’ under Australian procedures is, in their view, of no effect whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second place, loss of original <span class="highlight">nationality</span> results automatically from  naturalisation  in the case of persons who were originally nationals of countries such as the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> which have arisen in relation to Yugoslavia and Greece in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition might be prepared to look at this matter again if the Minister can come back to us and state that he has solved the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, especially with Yugoslavia, a particular friend of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the Minister would use his undoubted - as he would believe - persuasive abilities in order to persuade certain countries where there are real problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, notably the Government’s new-found friends in Yugoslavia, to overcome the problems which dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> causes a significant number of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a change to the provisions of the Principal Acts of 1966 relating to restrictions upon surrender of a fugitive where he could be prejudiced on account of race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or political opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there remains an essential need for international travellers generally to be able to identify themselves and to establish their <span class="highlight">nationality</span> by producing a valid travel document and in Australia’s case I believe our best interests arc currently served by retaining the visa requirement except for direct transit traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-62-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: -Firstly, the right of all Australian  enterprises to  obtain  funds in the  most efficient manner having regard to associated technological, marketing, financial and other benefits; secondly, the right of individual investors of any <span class="highlight">nationality</span> to buy or sell shares freely, thus ensuring the widest possible scope and flexibility for the Australian capital market; thirdly, the right of Australians to invest funds abroad in order to avoid insulation of our equity markets from world trends; and fourthly the establishment of guidelines for all multi-national companies domiciled in Australia, embodying Australians to comprise a majority of the senior management and the board of directors; the encouragement of all such companies of a major size to list publicly on the Australian stock exchanges, restrictive export franchises to be discouraged, and the policies of such companies not to be detrimental to Australia’s national goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty in this case is the difficulty in so many cases, a difficulty of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> which I might describe as one of the curses of citizenship throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that we would make considerable progress in future not only in this case but in all cases in which families find themselves in this sort of situation as a result of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may at first sight seem surprising that despite the passing of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and the creation of separate Australian citizenship by the British <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> Act 1948 (Imperial) and the Australian Citizenship Act 1948-1973 (Commonwealth) . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A number of people have expressed concern that their place of birth is shown in their passports, and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence recommended in its 1976 report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> that consideration be given to deleting the ‘place of birth’ from Australian passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The country of the ship’s flag could well be different from that of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the accused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that the discussions with the Yugoslav Government have resulted in this understanding of Australian citizens’ points of view and I am very hopeful that the discussions which will continue with the Yugoslav Government, relating to the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, will have a mutually acceptable result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most of the persons whom objected to dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and who recommended the deletion of the birthplace were, broadly speaking, from behind the Iron Curtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The adoption of this suggestion might tend to avoid some difficulties encountered by dual nationals when visiting the country of their other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>) The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the Protocol, defines a refugee as a person who, ‘owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surprisingly, and I think irresponsibly, the Minister for Transport said that as the statement in the report to which I have referred did not include particulars of the identity or <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the ships in question, no meaningful answer could be given to the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, it also reflects the further recognition that the effectiveness of a patent system is in no way dependent upon the territorial origin of an invention or the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of a patentee and that those factors are essentially irrelevant to the operation of a patent system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- On 14 October 1976 the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  presented to the House on behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence the Committee’s report on The International Legal and Diplomatic Aspects of the Situation of Australians Possessing Dual or Plural <span class="highlight">Nationality</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Joint Committee was presented on a realistic note by the honourable member with the comment that the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> are well nigh impossible of unilateral resolution by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties that arise for Australian citizens from their dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> are however of continuing concern to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will recall that in my statement of 26 May 1 978 on consular services I dealt with the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This booklet contains information and advice on the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long-standing policy of the Australian Government of avoiding wherever possible the creation by its legislation of instances of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, while at the same time giving recognition to such status wherever it occurs, has been reaffirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, responsible Ministers and departments are also active in disseminating information on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems- another recommendation of the Joint Committee report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There remain two recommendations of the report calling for constructive action: That Australia should initiate relevant action in the United Nations and should give high priority to negotiating bilateral agreements to overcome dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formidable difficulties of a political, legal and practical nature stand in the way of progress on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems, either by way of bilateral or multilateral agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also proposes to examine further the possibility of having the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> examined in an appropriate forum of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While speaking about this question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> I should mention that the Government is keenly aware of the concern felt by certain Australian citizens about the new Soviet law on citizenship which came into force on 1 July this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If other countries are anxious to have us take their citizens- as many countries are because they are anxious to get the financial exchange which in many cases is remitted to them- it seems to be an appropriate time to suggest that those countries might enter into a bilateral arrangement whereby a citizen, on acceptance of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in Australia, is no longer obliged to be a dual national. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will notice that it is an accepted principle of international law that diplomatic protection may not be given by a state to a dual national of that state when he is in the country of the other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that the Hague Convention was of the opinion that a person should have only one <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it would be the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the resident’s permanent domicile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem appropriate that we should be using some of our monetary muscle to indicate clearly to these countries that when citizens leave them and come to Australia, by a bilateral arrangement which we should negotiate at the time, and if they adopt our citizenship, they should be accepted by other countries as having one <span class="highlight">nationality</span> only, namely, that of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example of a multipartite agreement to which the Committee made reference is the 1963 Council of Europe Convention on Reduction of Cases of Multiple <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> and Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple <span class="highlight">Nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Convention comprises two substantive chaptersChapter I concerns reduction of cases of multiple <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and Chapter II concerns military obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Conventions concluded between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, which require only that a person seek the consent of the State in which he is not resident but whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> he wishes to retain, Chapter II of the Council of Europe Convention requires that a person seek the consent of the State whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> he wishes to renounce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such consent may not, however, be withheld if the person has not been a resident of that State for ten years and is at the time ordinarily resident in the State whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> he wishes to retain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is considering the desirability of Australia doing so, although it should be noted that the countries with which Australia encounters most difficulties over dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> are not parties to the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said:   the effectiveness of a patent system is in no way dependent upon the territorial origin of an invention or the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of a patentee and that those factors are essentially irrelevant to the operation  of a  patent system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is his view that the effectiveness of a patent system is independent of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the patentee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these considerations should lay to rest once and for all the Minister’s apparent view- and I am only taking this view from the comments in his second reading speech- that the effectiveness of our patent system is independent of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the patentee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is unique among the major powers in that the Soviet Union’s dominant <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is portentially outnumbered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The requirement for Soviet citizens to show ‘<span class="highlight">nationality</span> ‘ under its internal passport system and on all official forms ensures the Soviet officials the opportunity to identify and then destroy national groups within Soviets outside Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make one point in relation to human rights in the Soviet Union and in relation to the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> question: I do not necessarily support nationalistic claims, whether they be by people who originated in the Baltic States or in the Ukraine, those of Jews and so on and tend to oppose nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people had democratic freedoms, the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> questions would be resolved in a democratic manner inside the United Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registration is basically to establish <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and grant flag rights, however, I would point out that the critical factors are not the conditions of registry but rather the subsequent control of seaworthiness, safety and manning aspects exercised by ‘open registry ‘ countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there is no <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or residence test, an Australian citizen resident in Australia who meets these criteria would be eligible to receive such a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-55-21">[More…]</a></p>
