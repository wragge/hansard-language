<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of  Mr Janoslav 
              Petrovsky who was prosecuted on 17th June 1971 in Sydney for stowing away on the
              vessel Britanis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without reference to the records I am unable to inform the honourable senator of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the controller who was in the tower at that time, but I can say that he is not employed by the Department at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation: What is the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the aerodrome controller who was on duty in the tower at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on the evening of 29th January 1.971? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next is: ‘The avoidance of discrimination on any grounds of race or colour of skin or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this letter reference is made, as  Senator Mulvihill  said, to people who were considered to have dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, in particular Greeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When such persons are in the country of second <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, (including a country which permits holders of Australian passports to enter without visas) their Australian citizenship  may  not exempt them from obligations such as military service in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, even though a case of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> may be involved, our authorities have the right to intercede. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has pursued these inquiries but its efforts have been complicated by the dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> aspects of each of the cases involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the price of recognition of the new Government of Greece will the Australian Government insist that the Greek Government adopt a much more flexible attitude to dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When deciding suitable alternative forms of recognition of outstanding public service in place of the former honours awards, would it not be appropriate to provide an Australian honour running even to a special citizenship status for international figures who render great service to mankind, regardless of colour, class, creed or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Government of Greece included everybody of Greek <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, even though they might hold dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, when it issued its mobilisation orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of our attitude on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> we were on the point of taking this matter up with the Greek Government in respect of Australian citizens of Greek origin but the Government in Greece changed and I understand that the exit points which were closed are now open and there is no difficulty in Greek/Australians leaving Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment figures in respect of refugees who arrived in 1974 and are now in the community are not available, but among those residing in hostels throughout Australia on 4.8.75 there were 27 breadwinners of Chilean <span class="highlight">nationality</span> both refugees and non-refugees not in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was therefore appropriate for her case to be taken up with the Chilean authorities by the Embassy of the country of her <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any application to migrate to Australia from Northern Ireland lodged by the holder of a Republic of Ireland passport would be considered within the scope of normal migrant policy which is applied globally irrespective of the race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the applicant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because migration application and approval statistics are maintained on the basis of the country in which application is made and not on the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of applicants it is not possible to provide figures on the number of South African citizens who have applied and been approved for residence in Australia during the period for which this information is sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Government considered the question of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of nearly two thousand Timorese people now resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are any overtones of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> involved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Baird has not contacted the Consulate-General concerning his position which, as far as the Department of Foreign Affairs is aware, was not affected either by his marriage to an American national or by considerations of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister feel that these present safeguards protect Australia against illegal immigrants who may come to Australia under an assumed name and an assumed <span class="highlight">nationality</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is  Mr O’Driscoll’s  wife, and what passport did she hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that Yugoslavs, like all persons ordinarily resident in Australia, whether British or of any other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, are required to register for national service in the same way as are Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1948 when introducing the <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> and Citizenship Bill, the then Minister, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not sufficient for the Minister to quote what was said in 1948 when the first <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> and Citizenship Bill was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not normal practice for airlines or aviation authorities to maintain statistics by <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of passengers travelling on particular airlines and accordingly information is not available which would enable the last part of the question to be answered, although Air Vietnam operates international services on which undoubtedly Australians, including servicemen, may have been passengers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eligibility for War Service Homes assistance is governed by the provisions of the War Service Homes Act which does not differentiate between persons on the basis of race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pointed out the applications for all forms of war service homes assistance, including proposals to buy group homes, are considered only having regard to the requirements of the Act which contains no provisions in any way related to the colour, race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the goodwill engendered by the tremendous amount of money we are spending in bringing people to this country will largely be offset by the poor reputation we will give Australia in the minds of thinking people in every part of the world, of whatever race or whatever <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 11 of the <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> and Citizenship Act means that a person who is born out of Australia and whose mother or father is an Australian citizen, providing only that the birth is registered at an Australian consulate, is also an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (c) The Annual Return to Parliament of persons granted Australian citizenship during 1970-71 by virtue of the grant of certificates of citizenship under Sections 15 and 12 of the Citizenship Act, 1948-1969, provides both a breakdown on a <span class="highlight">nationality</span> basis of the 27,343 persons naturalised, and the countries of origin of the 7,750 persons who were registered as Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer first to the 1969 edition of the ‘Senate Manual’ of the United States, which states that a Joint Congressional Committee on Immigration and <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> Policy has been established to investigate the problems of aliens and <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But from the way in which  Senator Poyser  has been arguing today, assisted passages must be made available to anybody in the world, whatever their race, the colour of their skin or their <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the figures that he produced, our Leader pointed out that this policy possibly would mean a smaller intake of Asian migrants because of the small number of Asians in this country, but the assistance we gave to migrants to Australia would not depend upon their race or their <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before referring to the particular trend of the honourable senator’s question I think I should say that this morning I was provided with a note as to the obligations of Greek nationals for military service insofar as those obligations apply to people of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Mathas problem, as I have seen it reported, arises from the fact that apparently some form of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> occurs when a Creek citizen becomes an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface to my question, addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I refer to a letter from the Minister for Immigration in which the concluding paragraph mentions further action to assist people whose country of their birth claims dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that officers of the Department of Immigration should advise migrants from countries such as Greece that have compulsory military service that irrespective of whether they are naturalised in Australia they retain their former <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and on returning to their former country, irrespective of how long they had been away from it, will be required to undergo military training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have to accept that in far more positive ways we have to bring home to migrants to this country, who may retain dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> according to the laws of the country from which they have come, the fact that they may have obligations and be subjected to all types of privation if they go back to those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Menzies gave a little lecture on Balkan history and stated that police ‘had found no evidence whatever to support allegations of Ustashi violence towards individuals of Yugoslav <span class="highlight">nationality</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I use the expression ‘physical persecution’ in the sense in which it has been interpreted in section 243 (h) of the United States Immigration and <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> Act of 19S2 under which the AttorneyGeneral of the United States of America is autho rised to withhold deportation of an alien to any country in which, in his opinion, he would be subject to physical persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Acts provide that the Attorney-General should not issue a warrant for the return of a fugitive if he has substantial grounds for believing that, if the fugitive is surrendered to the requesting country, ‘he may be prejudiced at his trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty by reason of his race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or political opinions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Immigration is reported to have stated during the week-end that he had under consideration the deportation of about 50 people, will the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration inform the Senate of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of these people and the reasons for considering their deportation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the people who are involved nor pf the breaches of the law which they might have committed and which would warrant the Minister giving consideration to their deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The challenge has been issued - I issue it again - if he has evidence which will stand in court he should prosecute the people accused of violence, whether they are Croats or people of any other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive, although purporting to have been made in respect of an offence for which, but for this section, he would be liable to be surrendered to that state, was made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or political opinions; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>if the fugitive ls surrendered to that state, he may be prejudiced at his trial, or punished, detained or restricted In his personal liberty, by reason of his race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or political opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to that, in respect of any of the new treaties with which we are dealing, insofar as we are changing or extending the law there would be a prior onus - if one likes to call it that - on the Attorney-General that he is not to give a notice - that is, not to set the process in train - or even to bring the person before a magistrate if there are ‘substantial grounds for believing’ that in effect, as  Senator McManus  is putting it, the person is being dealt with because of his political opinions, race, religion or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister consider preparing a series of statements in the various languages and, where a naturalised Australian citizen seeks to return to a homeland which does not necessarily recognise Australian naturalisation, arrange for that person to be handed a statement indicating the position in regard to the country he proposes to visit, making it clear to him that his Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> does not necessarily guarantee that he will be allowed to return to this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While on the subject may I say that it is and has been over the years, a matter of great interest how this question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> should operate in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be forgotten by the Senate when it looks at this issue of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> that there are literally tens of thousands of such dual citizens in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of this year there would be at least hundreds and perhaps over the years there have been many thousands of citizens of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> - say Yugoslav and Australian - who have appeared in the Australian courts on all sorts of charges; some may be minor, some extremely serious and some of the utmost importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would apply to foreign born citizens with dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in Australia who are charged with offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do know that the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated in this chamber that certain information has been sought about events in Yugoslavia concerning Australian citizens who may be of Yugoslav <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be, of course, that the crime of treason stands today at the peak of the hierarchy of offences, that is, in the concept of our regard for <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, our nation and the protection of iS security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that you and your son have been naturalised there are <span class="highlight">nationality</span> requirements for entry which your son does not possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country have good reason to appreciate the problems which dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> involves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is something which an act of renunciation on the part of a person taking out Australian citizenship will not in any way overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Italy, Greece or Yugoslavia- to mention 3 countries in relation to which dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems have arisenasserts a claim or seeks to exact an obligation from one of the native born citizens of those countries then the fact that those persons have become Australian citizens and have formally renounced the citizenship of their country of birth will not persuade those countries to take any other attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we can move towards a situation where there will be an end to dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and a general acceptance of one <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and procedures whereby if there is doubt as to a person ‘s <span class="highlight">nationality</span> there will be a means under international law to determine the actual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the centuries there have been 2 broad schools of thought with regard to this concept of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the doctrine of dominant or effective <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That doctrine is established by examining the habitual residence of a person whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is in question and examining his conduct and activities with a view to determining the country with which he has the closest connection so that you can determine what is his effective, dominant or master <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis it is to the country of his dominant <span class="highlight">nationality</span> that he owes obligations and it is the country of his dominant <span class="highlight">nationality</span> which may assert its role in international affairs to protect that person if he needs state protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a feasible means whereby a person’s <span class="highlight">nationality</span> can be determined and it obviates the problems which dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> creates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a problem which is at the very root of the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> which, unfortunately, an increasing number of Australian citizens have been experiencing in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally not known that Australia is a party to an international convention on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The international convention of 1930 on certain questions relating to the conflict of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws is a convention to which Australia adhered in 1937. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, article 4 of this convention states in broad terms that a State may not afford diplomatic protection to one of its nationals against a State whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> such a person also possesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these circumstances, the return to the theory of dominant <span class="highlight">nationality</span> appears quite justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what we should endeavour to sustain is the concept of the one <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the individual’s act he should accept the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of one country and positively abdure any allegiance to any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fundamental first step to the acceptance of an Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us get rid of the concepts of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, although the reasoning may be tenuous, I believe that we should retain the provision renouncing previous allegiance as part of our oath of allegiance which people take as one step towards establishing what I believe is wholly desirable, namely, the traditional concept of a permanent, effective, master <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to comment firstly on the subject of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, which was a matter to which  Senator Greenwood  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable senator that the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is at present the subject of examination by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, which is, of course, a committee of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The subject of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> could well be one of the terms of references of the Senate Select Committee on the Civil Rights of Migrant Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the USSR) do not recognise loss of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> by mere renunciation; specific permission to relinquish the original <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is required, and the ‘renunciation’ under Australian procedures, is in their view, of no effect whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second place, loss of original <span class="highlight">nationality</span> results automatically from naturalisation in the case of persons who were originally nationals of countries such as the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria, Norway and Sweden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to keep us from hearing the views of anybody else, the Government has asked us to inquire into the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these questions- Omega and dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>- are jobs for small expert committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those matters include the investigation of the foreign affairs and defence implications of an Omega station in Australia and the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that  Senator McManus  should object to the reference on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> because the Committee that is humourously described as the Senate Select Committee on the Civil Rights of Migrant Australians was supposed to report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, among all its other problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that it was rather late for the Leader of the Democratic Labor Party,  Senator McManus,  to be complaining about any parliamentary committee inquiring into dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was suggested at the last meeting of the Committee that, as all the evidence on the Omega station had been heard, there should be a deferment of hearing the first evidence on the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> so that some witnesses could be heard on matters of a more general nature, this suggestion was agreed to by the  Chairman  and by all the Labor Party members of the Committee who were present at that meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 13 simplifies the giving of evidence of certain matters by empowering the Minister, the Secretary or a delegated person to give certificates of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of a boat, the juridical status of an area of waters, whether a licence was or was not held at the time of an offence or whether a licence was issued subject to conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware this would be done irrespective of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> when intrusion was in breach of our laws and was not acceptable to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether the matter of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> can be taken out of context like that, I am not sure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have discussed the whole matter of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in this chamber on several occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Citizens of some countries and some citizens with dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, risk losing their foreign <span class="highlight">nationality</span> by taking the oath or affirmation of allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Declaration includes the provision that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country, and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-This involves the vexed question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there is a problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>- whether it be with, say Greece or some other country- in general the essence of the problem is that each country claims that the person concerned is its national, and when that person is in either of the countries involved that country, in effect, claims dominion over him and also claims his allegiance and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor can a person be surrendered if he were to be prejudiced at his trial on account of race, religion, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or political opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I point out that the present Bill makes an additional provision to that now included in the Australian Film Development Corporation Act for the new Commission to take into account not only the residence but also the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of persons taking part in the making of a film. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such an oath, in the case of many countries, will cause a migrant to lose his <span class="highlight">nationality</span> before he has ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently practical difficulties are caused to some people whom we might want to be officers of the Public Service and who happen to have another <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is happening is that commonsense and the necessities of life are getting us to rely upon the specific provisions, specific offences, and specific obligations, instead of these vague kinds of oaths which cause difficulty to those who may have another <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This definition will apply generally and has the effect, subject to subsequent clauses, of extending the scope of the Act to permit regulation of all foreign fishing in the declared fishing zone, regardless of its purpose or of the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the foreign boat concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is involved in section 44 (i) which prevents anyone who is a citizen of a foreign power being elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This group says that under the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Bill and Human Rights Bill and the Victorian Avoidance of Discrimination Bill a person who chooses to marry his or her race, ethnic group, <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, or religion, and not to marry a person of another race, ethnic group, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or religion, does an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on colour, descent, national or ethnic origin or religion can be prosecuted and could happen under the Racial Discrimination Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the clause as it stands it is immaterial that the reason of race, colour, <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or ethnic origin is not the dominant reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Living in a remote continent without land frontiers, more isolated from realities on the rest of the plane than most other peoples, we are the Incas and the Aztecs of the 20th century, predictably ignorant of the significance of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would remember the difficulties he had, including difficulties with other Ministers in the then Government, about this very vexed question of people with dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that the acquisition of another <span class="highlight">nationality</span> by a person with Yugoslav citizenship is not recognised under Yugoslav law unless that person formally renounces his Yugoslav citizenship and the renunciation has been formally accepted by the Yugoslav Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view of the Yugoslav authorities is that it is a principle of international law, reaffirmed in article 4 of the 1930 Hague convention on certain questions relating to the conflict of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws, that a State may not afford diplomatic protection to one of its nationals against a State whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> such a person also possesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such circumstances the ability of Australian official representatives to assist an Australian citizen who has Yugoslav <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is limited if he commits an offence under Yugoslav law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware of how many people of either Australian or dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> are imprisoned in Yugoslavia and whether charges have related to their membership of soccer clubs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to the urgent desire of South Vietnamese students and others of that <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in Australia to obtain permanent residence for themselves and their close relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an Australian citizen, whether he be of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or a purely Australian citizen, suffers the rigours of the law, people immediately come to my office and say that he ought to be let off, that he is perfectly innocent, before they have looked at the evidence or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is quite untrue and unfair to say that for some unknown reason, because a person is a Yugoslav, because he is of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, we are not interested in him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think, as other honourable senators have told us, the arrangements include an agreement to Syria’s demand that passengers of the Jewish faith of any <span class="highlight">nationality</span> shall not be able to land in Syria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Wheeldon;  there is nothing wrong, if Syria is at war with Israel, with it excluding people of the Israeli <span class="highlight">nationality</span> as part of that state of war but we are told that people of the Jewish faith should not be allowed to land in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It constitutes a discrimination not only against religion, not only against race, but also against <span class="highlight">nationality</span>- all three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that distinction is important, because I understand that Israel refuses to permit into Israel people who hold passports from countries of the Arab League and that again reflects a state of conflict between those Arab countries and Israel, It emphasises the distinction between discriminating on the basis of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or citizenship- that is the passport- and discrimination clearly based on the faith or religion of the person concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is found that there is no way to overcome this discrimination against Jewish people whether of Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or any other <span class="highlight">nationality</span> it seems to me that Qantas ought to start examining alternative routes to avoid the discriminatory practice which has to a degree been forced upon it but which it has accepted by flying via Damascus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, persons who may have been Polish citizens at the time their property was nationalised have not been compensated under these treaties unless they also possessed at that time the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of one of those other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose it is my attitude to life- it may be my <span class="highlight">nationality</span>- to be in opposition but I did what  Senator Missen  and  Senator Tate  said was unique and I looked at the Ordinance before speaking on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may at first sight seem surprising that despite the passing of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and the creation of separate Australian citizenship by the British <span class="highlight">Nationality</span> Act 1948 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Simply stated, that is the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some new citizens the retention of the former <span class="highlight">nationality</span> may be beneficial for various reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it may be that an Australian citizen who migrated here from the United Kingdom would feel happy to retain dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> in that revisiting the United Kingdom would be much more simple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better employment opportunities may be available in the country of his former <span class="highlight">nationality</span> if that former <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very many advantages which can accrue to certain persons retaining the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of their former homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst that would be the case for some, for very many dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> becomes a curse and a burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that for very many Australian citizens dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is extremely serious and even fatal in one sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is precluded from offering consular protection to such an Australian citizen whilst in the other country of his dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government even executed Australian citizens who held Yugoslav <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Luckily, I think that incident is unique in the sense that to my knowledge executions without the Australian Government being informed have not occurred in any other nation of former <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of any Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Grassby,  the then Minister for Immigration, spoke of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> being ‘one of the curses of citizenship around the world’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those articles are only three of a very thick file of newspaper clippings which reveal that the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is one which seriously affects Australian citizens when they return to their former homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person should hold only one <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and be able to renounce in an appropriate way his former <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, presented to this Parliament on 14 October 1976- two and a half years ago- recommended that Australia should initiate action within the United Nations to renew efforts to resolve <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, international states-  are more prepared to forego their discretion to determine the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of their citizens than they were in 1 954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the Western European community, in the Council of Europe Convention in 1968, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, with bilateral arrangements with its Eastern European allies in the late and mid 1950s, have demonstrated considerable willingness to forego their claims on former nationals who wish to voluntarily renounce the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The East European model followed by the USSR and its allies is roughly to assume that the sole <span class="highlight">nationality</span> follows residence between the nations concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, one <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is the desire and the end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any evidence that this Government is seeking to conclude like arrangements with the USSR or its Eastern European allies in respect to Australian citizens who could be expected not to exercise the choice of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of their former homeland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person needs to seek the consent of the state whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> he wishes to renounce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even so, the former homeland may not withhold consent if the person concerned has not been resident there for 10 years or more and is ordinarily resident in the state whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> he wishes to retain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the Western European democracies, we have a perfectly accessible means of assuring that the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> do not attach to Australian citizens who come from those European democracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has long passed for pious declarations about the desirability of single Australian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> for a citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, it is impossible to substantiate the incidence or scale of such harassment- harassment that allegedly goes beyond access that consular officials of the country of the other <span class="highlight">nationality</span> properly might have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot say whether his office would be the best means of sorting out these allegations of harassment, which possibly would be few in number; but clearly the Committee thought that the type of investigative and conciliatory approach which characterises the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations is a type in which the aggrieved Australian citizen of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> could have confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In entering this debate on the motion regarding dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is a very complex one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, I think that the term ‘dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>’ is a misnomer and that it should be ‘dual citizenship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support particularly the recommendation which confirms the Australian belief, the Government belief, that every person should have one <span class="highlight">nationality</span> only, with the exception that I would refer to citizenship and not <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that the discussions with the Yugoslav Government have resulted in this understanding of Australian citizens’ points of view and I am very hopeful that the discussions which will continue with the Yugoslav Government, relating to the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, will have a mutually acceptable result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to <span class="highlight">nationality</span> versus citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my point of view, and I would say from the points of view of the majority of Continental people, there is a big difference between <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, there cannot be a British national because I do not think that there is a British <span class="highlight">nationality</span> as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly believe that we should make a clear distinction when referring to <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today maybe <span class="highlight">nationality</span> would be better equated with ethnicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My <span class="highlight">nationality</span> is Slovenian but I am an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I would say that <span class="highlight">nationality</span>’ has a different connotation and a different meaning from ‘citizenship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore <span class="highlight">nationality</span> has nothing to do with the rights of a citizen as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will take notice of the report’s recommendation in that regard and that it will take notice of the difference between the interpretation of the word ‘<span class="highlight">nationality</span>’ and that of the word ‘citizenship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the early part of 1977 I have been in correspondence with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  about this question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It related to the difficulties experienced by Australian citizens of Yugoslavian birth when they visited that country and the difficulties that they experienced in this country by reason of their dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that is the point that  Senator Lajovic  stressed- the question of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a shorter term objective, high priority should be accorded to entering into bilateral agreements between Australia and those countries whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws cause Australian citizens to be dual nationals and who suffer disadvantage because of this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation was for the Government to attempt to achieve a shorter term objective by establishing a high priority to be accorded to the making of bilateral arrangements between Australia and those countries whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws cause Australian citizens to be dual nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recommendation indicated that these negotiations should take place with those countries whose <span class="highlight">nationality</span> laws cause Australian citizens to be dual nationals and who suffer disadvantage because of this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who becomes a member of this Parliament very soon runs into the distress and difficulties caused to many citizens by this very real problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or, as  Senator Lajovic  would call it, dual citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Committee said in 1976, every person should have the one <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or, as  Senator Lajovic  prefers it to be put, one citizenship only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of people have expressed concern that their place of birth is shown in their passports, and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence recommended in its 1 976 report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> that consideration be given to deleting ‘Place of Birth’ from Australian passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was any attempt made, at the time the agreement was authorised, to acquaint the person whose authority was required, or was that person acquainted, with the Syrian regulations in relation to visas and, in particular, that any person of the Jewish faith of any <span class="highlight">nationality</span> was not permitted through Syrian air space on any flight, or  to be  in a plane which landed in Syria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators look at the list of organisations to which flags are to be issued, they will see that these organisations very properly might acknowledge some sense of <span class="highlight">nationality</span> and use a flag in a way that all senators and members would think appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>White Australia policy is long dead, that our immigration policy today is totally nondiscriminatory and is applied consistently to all applicants regardless of race, colour, <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, descent, national or ethnic origin and sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had he been of some other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, such as British or South African, maybe he would not have been sent back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have again reviewed this case but I am satisfied the decision to refuse  Mr Grekos  a visit visa was reasonably based on policy and there was no discrimination based on race or <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, I repeat the advice given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement to the Parliament in May last year that the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> cannot be overcome by citizens simply asserting that they do not accept their other citizenship and that it is for the individual to ascertain in advance the consequences of coming within the jurisdiction of another country which claims his or her citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who are the children around the world without the protection of any government, effectively without any <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, with no government willing to offer them protection and security- the ones most in need, having first claim to receive protection and relief? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason why I quoted from the roneoed document which was sent to all senators and which was the property of all senators was to support the argument, which I think is supported by all honourable senators, that no disadvantages should be incurred by Australian citizens by reason of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence recommended in its 1976 report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> that consideration be given to deleting this requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers said the prevention of child removal was a complex matter involving questions of jurisdiction, dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, citizenship, freedom of travel and rights of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst a passport is in no sense an exit visa, and it is not necessary for an Australian to have a passport in order to leave Australia, it is effectively an entry visa from the point of view of the receiving country, which requires a passport as identification of the person concerned and of his or her <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that a passport is evidence of personal identity and <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I am an Australian citizen, surely, on the payment of a reasonable fee for the preparation of the documentation, I ought to be in possession of my own passport as proof of who 1 am and of my <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so linked to my basic human right to move around freely that, as an extension of that right, the passport evidencing my <span class="highlight">nationality</span> ought to be my own property and not the property of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken some three years for the Government to ponder the report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adoption of this suggestion might tend to avoid some difficulties encountered by dual nationals when visiting the country of their other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, in its report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, looked at a problem that has been talked about today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adoption of this suggestion might tend to avoid some difficulties encountered by dual nationals when visiting the country of their other <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requests for removal of the place of birth from passports are recieved mainly from citizens born overseas who wish to avoid problems when returning to their countries of birth or other <span class="highlight">nationality</span> or who wish to avoid identification with a nation or regime with which they are out of sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation in the report on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> from the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs and Defence that place of birth be deleted from Australian passports and be substituted by place of residence has been given a great deal of consideration by an interdepartmental committee and by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 14 October 1976 the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  presented to the House on behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence the Committee’s report on ‘the International Legal and Diplomatic Aspects of the Situation of Australians Possessing Dual or Plural <span class="highlight">Nationality</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Joint Committee was presented on a realistic note by the honourable member with the comment that the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> are well nigh impossible of unilateral resolution by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties that arise for Australian citizens from their dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> are however of continuing concern to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will recall that in my statement of 26 May 1978 on Consular Services I dealt with the problems of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This booklet contains information and advice on the problem of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long-standing policy of the Australian Government of avoiding wherever possible the creation by its legislation of instances of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, while at the same time giving recognition to such status wherever it occurs has been reaffimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, responsible Ministers and Departments are also active in disseminating information on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems- another recommendation of the Joint Committee Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There remain two recommendations of the report calling for constructive action: that Australia should initiate relevant action in the United Nations and should give high priority to negotiating bilateral agreements to overcome dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formidable difficulties of a political, legal and practical nature stand in the way of progress on dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> problems, either by way of bilateral or multilateral agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also proposes to examine further the possibility of having the question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> examined in an appropriate forum of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst speaking about this question of dual <span class="highlight">nationality</span> I should mention that the Government is keenly aware of the concern felt by certain Australian citizens about the new Soviet Law on Citizenship which came into force on 1 July this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the breakdown of the research staff employed by the Institute, by <span class="highlight">nationality</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies does not take the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of applicants into account when considering applications for research grants or the appointment of research workers to the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not consider that the cost in time and money of extracting information about the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of grant recipients and staff could be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b ) Implement the recommendation in the Report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration (paragraph 8.2.14) that all <span class="highlight">nationality</span> requirements for permanent appointment to the Australian Public Service be abolished except where the Governor-General in Council prescribes Australian citizenship by regulation as a qualification (not a condition of eligibility) for particular positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, it also reflects the further recognition that the effectiveness of a patent system is in no way dependent upon the territorial origin of an invention or the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of a patentee and that those factors are essentially irrelevant to the operation of a patent system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have, it claims, the right to affection, love and understanding; to adequate nutrition, medical care and free education; to full opportunity for play and recreation; to a name and <span class="highlight">nationality</span>; to special care if handicapped; to be the first to receive relief in times of disaster; to learn to be a useful member of society; to develop individual abilities; to be brought up in a spirit of peace and universal brotherhood; and to enjoy all of those rights regardless of race, religion, colour, sex and national or social origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to a name and <span class="highlight">nationality</span> can be granted because it does not infringe any one else’s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you will be aware, the Indonesian Government has decided that residents of East Timor not opting for the Indonesian <span class="highlight">nationality</span> would no longer be eligible to maintain or gain employment or carry out any sort of commercial activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that basic fact is appreciated, it is clear that the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of a patentee is totally irrelevant to the operation of a patent system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if honourable senators visit a gaol they will find ‘a screw is a screw is a screw’ regardless of <span class="highlight">nationality</span>, wherever he or she may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the recipients, in the case of grants for research to be carried out overseas by non-Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>Will the Minister add to this statement to give the location and <span class="highlight">nationality</span> of the people referred to by the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-27">[More…]</a></li>
