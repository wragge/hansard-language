    <p>Why did the Commonwealth wait until 12th June 1969 to supply the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations with the information which, in reply to its request of 18th July 1968, the States gave it in July and August 1968 on the implementation of the principles of the 1953 Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> (Hansard, 3 May 1971, page 2418). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> is concerned, the position remains as set out in the Prime Minister’s reply of 29 May 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which States replied to the Commonwealth letter of 18th July 1968 seeking some information which would assist in enabling a reply to be sent to a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations for information in regard to the implementation of the 1953 Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> (Hansard, 29th May 1969, page 2556 and 19th March 1970, page 719), and when did they do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will the Commonwealth next make inquiries of the States to enable it to send the  two-yearlyinformation  to the Secretary-General in regard to the implementation of the 1953 Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> (Hansard, 27th October 1971, page 2648). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the same basis I also object to the proposition that to oppose the principle of ZPG is somehow an attack on the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These functions included a wide range of community services and State functions and a lot of control over many forms of social legislation including, for example, workers compensation, gambling, censorship, consumer protection, the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>, the rights of minors, daylight saving and control of firearms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The critical issue defined by the California Supreme Court was whether the state had any legitimate interest in the regulation of abortion which would justify so deep an infringement of the fundamental <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I warn this wholly male House that it is because we are males there is a great danger that we will ignore the needs and <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are interested in the rights of children as well as the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> and the value and worth of the family unit, rather than the concept of sex without responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does it not wish to defend the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has Australia ratified the Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> as a positive instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Australia will deposit an instrument of accession to the Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> on 10 December 1974, the 26th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did he say, in his speech on 1 1 September 1 974 on International Women’s Year, that Australia is not a party to the Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span> because there is still legislation in two States, South Australia and Tasmania, that does not yet fully conform with the requirements of that Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall mark the 26th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights next Tuesday by becoming a party to 2 significant international conventions on the civil <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>, the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1953 Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a day set aside every year to commemorate a courageous group of women in the United States of America who campaigned in the streets, many years before it was accepted that one could campaign in the streets, for the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed to single out the spouse in this way surely must be offensive to those who are taking an interest in such matters as International Women’s Year and in the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> and their position in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will permit those intentions to be translated even further into action and it will be yet another example, and a major one at that, of the recognition by this Government of the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was left to my Government to ratify the 1953 Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span>, the 1951 International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1958 Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ratified the 1953 United Nations Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most dependent spouses are widows rather than widowers, this is decidedly an improvement in the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ratified the International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention 1951, and the United Nations Convention on the Political <span class="highlight">Rights of Women</span>, 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes me sick to hear some of the hypocrisy that comes from the mouths of men about the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> to control their own bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day these arguments of the quality of life for both parents and children and the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> have to be weighed on the scales against the principle of the right of human beings to be born, provided the safety of the mother’s life is not at issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then again, the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that none of us would readily say that the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> should not be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an honest and conscientious legislator I have to say that although I embrace the Menhennitt ruling, although I am against abortion, and although I understand the sanctity of the foetus, the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> and the social implications of abortion, I cannot in conscience support the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They speak of the <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> to control their bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">rights of women</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
